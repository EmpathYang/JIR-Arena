To build a tetrahedron from a triangle, we position a new vertex above the plane of the triangle and connect this vertex to all three vertices of the original triangle.\nThe number of a given dimensional element in the tetrahedron is now the sum of two numbers: first the number of that element found in the original triangle, plus the number of new elements, \"each of which is built upon elements of one fewer dimension from the original triangle\".

The notion of a gap in an alignment is important in many biological applications, since the insertions or deletions comprise an entire sub-sequence and often occur from a single mutational event. Furthermore, single mutational events can create gaps of different sizes. Therefore, when scoring, the gaps need to be scored as a whole when aligning two sequences of DNA. Considering multiple gaps in a sequence as a larger single gap will reduce the assignment of a high cost to the mutations.

It is only when such locations are linked together into more complicated shapes that the full richness and geometric complexity of 4D and higher dimensional spaces emerge. A hint to that complexity can be seen in the accompanying animation of one of simplest possible 4D objects, the 4D cube or tesseract.\n\nSection::::History.\nLagrange wrote in his \"M\u00e9canique analytique\" (published 1788, based on work done around 1755) that mechanics can be viewed as operating in a four-dimensional space \u2014 three dimensions of space, and one of time. In 1827 M\u00f6bius realized that a fourth dimension would allow a three-dimensional form to be rotated onto its mirror-image, and by 1853 Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli had discovered many polytopes in higher dimensions, although his work was not published until after his death. Higher dimensions were soon put on firm footing by Bernhard Riemann's 1854 thesis, \"\u00dcber die Hypothesen welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen\", in which he considered a \"point\" to be any sequence of coordinates (\"x\", ..., \"x\"). The possibility of geometry in higher dimensions, including four dimensions in particular, was thus established.\n\nAn arithmetic of four dimensions called quaternions was defined by William Rowan Hamilton in 1843. This associative algebra was the source of the science of vector analysis in three dimensions as recounted in \"A History of Vector Analysis\". Soon after tessarines and coquaternions were introduced as other four-dimensional algebras over R.\n\nOne of the first major expositors of the fourth dimension was Charles Howard Hinton, starting in 1880 with his essay \"What is the Fourth Dimension?\"; published in the Dublin University magazine. He coined the terms \"tesseract\", \"ana\" and \"kata\" in his book \"A New Era of Thought\", and introduced a method for visualising the fourth dimension using cubes in the book \"Fourth Dimension\".\n\nHinton's ideas inspired a fantasy about a \"Church of the Fourth Dimension\" featured by Martin Gardner in his January 1962 \"Mathematical Games column\" in \"Scientific American\". In 1886 Victor Schlegel described his method of visualizing four-dimensional objects with Schlegel diagrams.\n\nIn 1908, Hermann Minkowski presented a paper consolidating the role of time as the fourth dimension of spacetime, the basis for Einstein's theories of special and general relativity. But the geometry of spacetime, being non-Euclidean, is profoundly different from that popularised by Hinton. The study of Minkowski space required new mathematics quite different from that of four-dimensional Euclidean space, and so developed along quite different lines. This separation was less clear in the popular imagination, with works of fiction and philosophy blurring the distinction, so in 1973 H. S. M. Coxeter felt compelled to write:\n\nSection::::Vectors.\nMathematically, four-dimensional space is simply a space with four spatial dimensions, that is a space that needs four parameters to specify a point in it. For example, a general point might have position vector a, equal to\nThis can be written in terms of the four standard basis vectors (e, e, e, e), given by\nso the general vector a is\nVectors add, subtract and scale as in three dimensions.\nThe dot product of Euclidean three-dimensional space generalizes to four dimensions as\nIt can be used to calculate the norm or length of a vector,\nand calculate or define the angle between two non-zero vectors as\nMinkowski spacetime is four-dimensional space with geometry defined by a non-degenerate pairing different from the dot product:\nAs an example, the distance squared between the points (0,0,0,0) and (1,1,1,0) is 3 in both the Euclidean and Minkowskian 4-spaces, while the distance squared between (0,0,0,0) and (1,1,1,1) is 4 in Euclidean space and 2 in Minkowski space; increasing formula_8 actually decreases the metric distance. This leads to many of the well-known apparent \"paradoxes\" of relativity.\nThe cross product is not defined in four dimensions. Instead the exterior product is used for some applications, and is defined as follows:\nThis is bivector valued, with bivectors in four dimensions forming a six-dimensional linear space with basis (e, e, e, e, e, e). They can be used to generate rotations in four dimensions.\n\nSection::::Orthogonality and vocabulary.\nIn the familiar three-dimensional space in which we live, there are three coordinate axes\u2014usually labeled \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\"\u2014with each axis orthogonal (i.e. perpendicular) to the other two. The six cardinal directions in this space can be called \"up\", \"down\", \"east\", \"west\", \"north\", and \"south\". Positions along these axes can be called \"altitude\", \"longitude\", and \"latitude\". Lengths measured along these axes can be called \"height\", \"width\", and \"depth\".\nComparatively, four-dimensional space has an extra coordinate axis, orthogonal to the other three, which is usually labeled \"w\". To describe the two additional cardinal directions, Charles Howard Hinton coined the terms \"ana\" and \"kata\", from the Greek words meaning \"up toward\" and \"down from\", respectively. A position along the \"w\" axis can be called \"spissitude\", as coined by Henry More.\nAs mentioned above, Herman Minkowski exploited the idea of four dimensions to discuss cosmology including the finite velocity of light. In appending a time dimension to three dimensional space, he specified an alternative perpendicularity, hyperbolic orthogonality. This notion provides his four-dimensional space with a modified simultaneity appropriate to electromagnetic relations in his cosmos. Minkowski's world overcame problems associated with the traditional absolute space and time cosmology previously used in a universe of three space dimensions and one time dimension.\n\nSection::::Geometry.\nThe geometry of four-dimensional space is much more complex than that of three-dimensional space, due to the extra degree of freedom.\nJust as in three dimensions there are polyhedra made of two dimensional polygons, in four dimensions there are 4-polytopes made of polyhedra. In three dimensions, there are 5 regular polyhedra known as the Platonic solids. In four dimensions, there are 6 convex regular 4-polytopes, the analogues of the Platonic solids. Relaxing the conditions for regularity generates a further 58 convex uniform 4-polytopes, analogous to the 13 semi-regular Archimedean solids in three dimensions. Relaxing the conditions for convexity generates a further 10 nonconvex regular 4-polytopes.\nIn three dimensions, a circle may be extruded to form a cylinder. In four dimensions, there are several different cylinder-like objects. A sphere may be extruded to obtain a spherical cylinder (a cylinder with spherical \"caps\", known as a spherinder), and a cylinder may be extruded to obtain a cylindrical prism (a cubinder). The Cartesian product of two circles may be taken to obtain a duocylinder. All three can \"roll\" in four-dimensional space, each with its own properties.\nIn three dimensions, curves can form knots but surfaces cannot (unless they are self-intersecting). In four dimensions, however, knots made using curves can be trivially untied by displacing them in the fourth direction\u2014but 2D surfaces can form non-trivial, non-self-intersecting knots in 4D space. Because these surfaces are two-dimensional, they can form much more complex knots than strings in 3D space can. The Klein bottle is an example of a knotted surface. Another such surface is the real projective plane."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-898778": 2, "wikipedia-23204": 1, "wikipedia-2120715": 1, "wikipedia-8398": 2, "wikipedia-32210654": 1, "wikipedia-15565288": 1, "wikipedia-18597245": 1, "wikipedia-221234": 1, "wikipedia-1364622": 2, "wikipedia-14999344": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-898778": 3, "wikipedia-23204": 1, "wikipedia-2120715": 1, "wikipedia-8398": 3, "wikipedia-32210654": 1, "wikipedia-15565288": 1, "wikipedia-18597245": 1, "wikipedia-221234": 1, "wikipedia-1364622": 3, "wikipedia-14999344": 1}}}

For instance, in analytic geometry, a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given linear equation, but in a more abstract setting, such as incidence geometry, a line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on it.\nWhen a geometry is described by a set of axioms, the notion of a line is usually left undefined (a so-called primitive object). The properties of lines are then determined by the axioms which refer to them. One advantage to this approach is the flexibility it gives to users of the geometry. Thus in differential geometry a line may be interpreted as a geodesic (shortest path between points), while in some projective geometries a line is a 2-dimensional vector space (all linear combinations of two independent vectors). This flexibility also extends beyond mathematics and, for example, permits physicists to think of the path of a light ray as being a line."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-22634860": 1, "wikipedia-946975": 2, "wikipedia-32186226": 1, "wikipedia-8240558": 1, "wikipedia-404049": 1, "wikipedia-9697": 1, "wikipedia-58610": 1, "wikipedia-5308894": 1, "wikipedia-1573991": 1, "wikipedia-593693": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-22634860": 1, "wikipedia-946975": 3, "wikipedia-32186226": 1, "wikipedia-8240558": 1, "wikipedia-404049": 1, "wikipedia-9697": 1, "wikipedia-58610": 1, "wikipedia-5308894": 1, "wikipedia-1573991": 1, "wikipedia-593693": 1}}}

This motivation is enhanced by the perceived benefits of obtaining closure, such as the increased ability to predict the world and a stronger basis for action. This motivation is also enhanced by the perceived costs of lacking closure, such as missing deadlines. \nAccording to Kruglanski et al., need for closure exerts its effects via two general tendencies: the urgency tendency (the inclination to attain closure as quickly as possible) and the permanence tendency (the tendency to maintain it for as long as possible). Together, these tendencies may produce the inclinations to seize and then freeze on early judgmental cues, reducing the extent of information processing and hypothesis generation and introducing biases in thinking."], "wikipedia-62321": ["Cloture (, also ), closure, or, informally, a guillotine is a motion or process in parliamentary procedure aimed at bringing debate to a quick end.

It was subsequently adopted by the United States Senate and other legislatures. The name \"cloture\" remains in the United States; in Commonwealth countries it is usually \"closure\" or, informally, \"guillotine\"; in the United Kingdom \"closure\" and \"guillotine\" are distinct motions."], "wikipedia-1699840": ["Active listening is a technique that is used in counseling, training, and solving disputes or conflicts. It requires that the listener fully concentrate, understand, respond and then remember what is being said. This is opposed to reflective listening where the listener repeats back to the speaker what they have just heard to confirm understanding of both parties. Empathic listening is about giving people an outlet for their emotions before being able to be more open, which is sharing experiences and being able to accept new perspectives on the troubled topic that is the reason of emotional suffering. Listening skills may establish flow rather than closed mindedness, negative emotions include stress, anger and frustration.\nSection::::Comprehending.\nComprehension is shared meaning between parties in a communication transaction. This is the first step in the listening process. The second step is being able to take breaks between discernible words, or talking segmentation.\nSection::::Retaining.\nRetaining is the second step in the process. Memory is essential to the listening process because the information retained when a person is involved in the listening process is how meaning from words is created. Because everyone has different memories, the speaker and the listener may attach different meanings to the same statement. However, memories are fallible, things like cramming may cause information to be forgotten.\nSection::::Responding.\nListening is an interaction between speaker and listener. It adds action to a normally passive process.\nSection::::Tactic.\nActive listening involves the listener observing the speaker's behavior and body language. Having the ability to interpret a person's body language lets the listener develop a more accurate understanding of the speaker's message. Having heard, the listener may then paraphrase the speaker's words. It is important to note that the listener is not necessarily agreeing with the speaker\u2014simply stating what was said.\nIndividuals in conflict often contradict each other. Ambushing occurs when one listens to someone else's argument for its weaknesses and ignore its strengths. This may include a distortion of the speaker's argument to gain a competitive advantage. On the other hand, if one finds that the other party understands, an atmosphere of cooperation can be created.\nIn the book \"Leader Effectiveness Training\", Thomas Gordon, who coined the term \"active listening\", states \"Active listening is certainly not complex. Listeners need only restate, in their own language, their impression of the expression of the sender. ... Still, learning to do Active Listening well is a rather difficult task ...\"\nSection::::Use.\nActive listening is used in a wide variety of situations, including public interest advocacy, community organizing, tutoring, medical workers talking to patients, HIV counseling, helping suicidal persons, management, \ncounseling and journalistic settings. In groups it may aid in reaching consensus. It may also be used in casual conversation or small talk to build understanding, though this can be interpreted as condescending.\nA listener can use several degrees of active listening, each resulting in a different quality of communication.\nThe proper use of active listening results in getting people to open up, avoiding misunderstandings, resolving conflict, and building trust. In a medical context, benefits may include increased patient satisfaction, improved cross-cultural communication, improved outcomes, or decreased litigation.\nActive listening can be lifted by the active listening observation scale.\nSection::::Barriers to active listening.\nSome barriers are due to hunger or fatigue of the listener, making them irritated and less inclined to listen to the speaker. Sometimes it is due to the language the speaker uses\u2014such as high sounding and bombastic words that can lead to ambiguity. Other barriers include distractions, trigger words, vocabulary, and limited attention span. Listening barriers may be psychological (e.g., emotions) or physical (e.g., noise and visual distraction).\nSection::::Barriers to active listening.:Shift response.\nShift response is the general tendency of a speaker in a conversation to affix attention to their position. This is a type of conversational narcissism\u2014the tendency of listeners to turn the topic to themselves without showing sustained interest in others. A support response is the opposite of a shift response; it is an attention giving method and a cooperative effort to focus the conversational attention on the other person. Instead of being me-oriented like shift response, it is we-oriented. It is the response a competent communicator is most likely to use.\nSection::::Barriers to active listening.:Understanding of non-verbal cues.\nIneffective listeners are unaware of non-verbal cues, though they dramatically affect how people listen. To a certain extent, it is also a perceptual barrier. Up to 93 percent of people's attitudes are formed by non-verbal cues. This should help one to avoid undue influence from non-verbal communication. In most cases, the listener does not understand the non-verbal cues the speaker uses. A person may show fingers to emphasize a point, but this may be perceived as an intent by the speaker to place their fingers in the listener's eyes. Overuse of non-verbal cues also creates distortion, and as a result listeners may be confused and forget the correct meaning.\nSection::::Overcoming listening barriers.\nThe active listening technique is used to improve personal communications in organizations. Listeners put aside their own emotions and ask questions and paraphrase what the speaker says to clarify and gain a better understanding of what the speaker intends to say. Judging or arguing prematurely is a result of holding onto a strict personal opinion. This hinders the ability to be able to listen closely to what is being said. Eye contact and appropriate body languages are seen as important components to active listening. The stress and intonation may also keep them active and away from distractions."], "wikipedia-39270442": ["Once the personal narrative's message has been effectively conveyed, the narrative is completed and the teller, or performer, will signal \u201cthe end of the episodic sequence, indicating that he or she has relinquished the role of dominant active contributor to the interaction, and is returning to the conversational mode\u201d. Performances are thus \u201ctemporally bound, with a defined beginning and end\u201d. These temporal boundaries also require the narrative to be told in the specific sequential order in which they occur."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-11073025": 1, "wikipedia-6470064": 1, "wikipedia-168845": 1, "wikipedia-24834060": 1, "wikipedia-4847167": 1, "wikipedia-62321": 1, "wikipedia-1699840": 1, "wikipedia-22884649": 1, "wikipedia-39270442": 1, "wikipedia-47305": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-11073025": 1, "wikipedia-6470064": 2, "wikipedia-168845": 2, "wikipedia-24834060": 1, "wikipedia-4847167": 1, "wikipedia-62321": 2, "wikipedia-1699840": 2, "wikipedia-22884649": 1, "wikipedia-39270442": 2, "wikipedia-47305": 1}}}

However, the specific \"90-degree gap\" mention may require deeper technical sources (e.g., computer graphics or topology). Wikipedia can provide foundational context but might lack granular detail.", "wikipedia-531432": ["When viewed with the proper vergence, an autostereogram does the same, the binocular disparity existing in adjacent parts of the repeating 2D patterns.\n\nThere are two ways an autostereogram can be viewed: \"wall-eyed\" and \"cross-eyed\". Most autostereograms (including those in this article) are designed to be viewed in only one way, which is usually wall-eyed. Wall-eyed viewing requires that the two eyes adopt a relatively parallel angle, while cross-eyed viewing requires a relatively convergent angle. An image designed for wall-eyed viewing if viewed correctly will appear to pop out of the background, while if viewed cross-eyed it will instead appear as a cut-out behind the background and may be difficult to bring entirely into focus.\n\nStereopsis, or stereo vision, is the visual blending of two similar but not identical images into one, with resulting visual perception of solidity and depth. In the human brain, stereopsis results from complex mechanisms that form a three-dimensional impression by matching each point (or set of points) in one eye's view with the equivalent point (or set of points) in the other eye's view. Using binocular disparity, the brain derives the points' positions in the otherwise inscrutable \"z\"-axis (depth).\n\nWhen the brain is presented with a repeating pattern like wallpaper, it has difficulty matching the two eyes' views accurately. By looking at a horizontally repeating pattern, but converging the two eyes at a point behind the pattern, it is possible to trick the brain into matching one element of the pattern, as seen by the left eye, with another (similar looking) element, beside the first, as seen by the right eye. With the typical wall-eyed viewing, this gives the illusion of a plane bearing the same pattern but located behind the real wall. The distance at which this plane lies behind the wall depends only on the spacing between identical elements.\n\nAutostereograms use this dependence of depth on spacing to create three-dimensional images. If, over some area of the picture, the pattern is repeated at smaller distances, that area will appear closer than the background plane. If the distance of repeats is longer over some area, then that area will appear more distant (like a hole in the plane).\n\nPeople who have never been able to perceive 3D shapes hidden within an autostereogram find it hard to understand remarks such as, \"the 3D image will just pop out of the background, after you stare at the picture long enough\", or \"the 3D objects will just emerge from the background\".

Dimensional analogy is the study of how (\"n\" \u2212 1) dimensions relate to \"n\" dimensions, and then inferring how \"n\" dimensions would relate to (\"n\" + 1) dimensions.\nDimensional analogy was used by Edwin Abbott Abbott in the book \"Flatland\", which narrates a story about a square that lives in a two-dimensional world, like the surface of a piece of paper. From the perspective of this square, a three-dimensional being has seemingly god-like powers, such as ability to remove objects from a safe without breaking it open (by moving them across the third dimension), to see everything that from the two-dimensional perspective is enclosed behind walls, and to remain completely invisible by standing a few inches away in the third dimension.\nBy applying dimensional analogy, one can infer that a four-dimensional being would be capable of similar feats from our three-dimensional perspective. Rudy Rucker illustrates this in his novel \"Spaceland\", in which the protagonist encounters four-dimensional beings who demonstrate such powers.\nAs a three-dimensional object passes through a two-dimensional plane, two-dimensional beings in this plane would only observe a cross-section of the three-dimensional object within this plane. For example, if a spherical balloon passed through a sheet of paper, beings in the paper would see first a single point, then a circle gradually growing larger, until it reaches the diameter of the balloon, and then getting smaller again, until it shrank to a point and then disappeared. Similarly, if a four-dimensional object passed through a three dimensional (hyper)surface, one could observe a three-dimensional cross-section of the four-dimensional object\u2014for example, a 4-sphere would appear first as a point, then as a growing sphere, with the sphere then shrinking to a single point and then disappearing.

A projection is a way for representing an \"n\"-dimensional object in dimensions. For instance, computer screens are two-dimensional, and all the photographs of three-dimensional people, places and things are represented in two dimensions by projecting the objects onto a flat surface. By doing this, the dimension orthogonal to the screen (\"depth\") is removed and replaced with indirect information. The retina of the eye is also a two-dimensional array of receptors but the brain is able to perceive the nature of three-dimensional objects by inference from indirect information (such as shading, foreshortening, binocular vision, etc.). Artists often use perspective to give an illusion of three-dimensional depth to two-dimensional pictures. The \"shadow\", cast by a fictitious grid model of a rotating tesseract on a plane surface, as shown in the figures, is also the result of projections.\nSimilarly, objects in the fourth dimension can be mathematically projected to the familiar three dimensions, where they can be more conveniently examined. In this case, the 'retina' of the four-dimensional eye is a three-dimensional array of receptors. A hypothetical being with such an eye would perceive the nature of four-dimensional objects by inferring four-dimensional depth from indirect information in the three-dimensional images in its retina.\nThe perspective projection of three-dimensional objects into the retina of the eye introduces artifacts such as foreshortening, which the brain interprets as depth in the third dimension. In the same way, perspective projection from four dimensions produces similar foreshortening effects. By applying dimensional analogy, one may infer four-dimensional \"depth\" from these effects.\nAs an illustration of this principle, the following sequence of images compares various views of the three-dimensional cube with analogous projections of the four-dimensional tesseract into three-dimensional space."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-1364622": 1, "wikipedia-226829": 1, "wikipedia-46339345": 1, "wikipedia-5693146": 1, "wikipedia-8100509": 1, "wikipedia-17428394": 1, "wikipedia-44362809": 1, "wikipedia-570922": 1, "wikipedia-7151375": 1, "wikipedia-811063": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-1364622": 2, "wikipedia-226829": 1, "wikipedia-46339345": 1, "wikipedia-5693146": 1, "wikipedia-8100509": 1, "wikipedia-17428394": 1, "wikipedia-44362809": 1, "wikipedia-570922": 1, "wikipedia-7151375": 1, "wikipedia-811063": 1}}}

Most people wrongly assume that a neighborhood plan will be done democratically. In reality, a city official may do all of the planning with minimal contact or input from the residents. The plan may also be done by a small, self-selected group of residents who ignore input from others in the neighborhood. Either way, without involvement of as many neighborhoods as possible, the outcome may lack critical information and perspectives and thus not fully represent the desires of the neighborhood residents. This may create problems for the community.\n\nNeighborhood planning can work with all scales of area, from city neighborhoods to rural areas. In the UK neighborhood planning in rural areas is led by Rural Community Councils who can assist rural communities or parishes in creating Parish Plans or Village Design Statements; a form of Community Led Planning. Other established methods exist including Market Town Initiatives. Neighborhood plans are a way of empowering local residents to take responsibility for their areas.\n\nSection::::Public involvement.\nThe purpose of neighborhood planning is to understand what individual neighborhoods want to become. To understand this, public participation of neighbors is absolutely crucial. In reality, it is only at this level, where the actual number of parties is small, that true democratic decision making may be possible.\n\nMany strategies may be used to involve neighborhood residents in the planning process. Outreach methods can get the word out that planning is taking place. Planners can involve neighbors by collecting data and information about the area and how the residents use it. Residents can assist in the planning process itself. A democratic neighborhood plan includes all three methods.\n\nOutreach Methods include five different techniques that may be used to inform the neighborhood that planning is taking place. The first type of method is personal contact and includes door-to-door visits and phone calls. This method is the most personalized, making it the most effective. It can also be the most time consuming. Time can be reduced by using a phone tree and distributing flyers to homes.\n\nmedia\u2014both printed and electronic\u2014are useful communication methods. Many newspapers and radio stations will run a press release or public service announcement (PSA). Media outlets that won't disseminate information for free usually accommodate paid ad space.\n\nThe third form of outreach methods are field office/ drop-in centers. This involves having an actual place where members of the neighborhood can drop by and learn about the planning process (usually outside of a high traffic, high density area). These centers need to have an individual available to answer questions that neighbors may have. This is also a great opportunity to provide residents with surveys that would gather more information to assist the planners.\n\nThe fourth outreach method involves utilizing existing organizations as a way to inform residents on the planning process. This method can use varying strategies to accomplish its goal. One way is to obtain permission to insert brightly colored flyers into news publications or hang them in public offices or retail stores. Posters and papers displayed in public locations are a great way to utilize an existing organization. \n\nThe fifth and final form of outreach methods are displays at key settings. This method is similar to using flyers or advertisements as a way to inform residents of planning. However, is different in the way that it accomplishes this. This method involves using a large vacant lot or path of high traffic to display information to the neighbors. The lot needs to be in a central and busy area of the neighborhood to be effective. All of these methods are ways planners can collect information from neighbors and involve them in the planning process.\n\nOther techniques of engagement can be carried out, the methodology chosen should be specific to the area and ideally be led by the local community. Questionnaires, workshops, exhibitions. Community development practitioners are often asked to assist with consultation as they can act as an independent facilitator to engagement.\n\nSection::::Planning process.\nAfter a valid and useful information source has been established, collecting information becomes easier. Collecting information is the first step in neighborhood planning. Planners combine the information they have gathered from residents with other information they have obtained from personal observation and surveying the land. They use all of this information to create a large, more informative picture of the neighborhood. \n\nThe second step in the neighborhood planning process is making sense of the information. This entails pinpointing issues and establishing the issues of major concern. Pinpointing issues helps define the ones that take precedence if they conflict with one another.\n\nSetting goals is the third step of neighborhood planning. This step should come easily after certain issues and problems have been discovered. The goals that are set need to represent the community and what would best suit their interests.\n\nThe fourth step in the neighborhood planning process is to come up with alternatives and select among them. This involves the planning committee coming up with different alternatives for each goal. After these alternatives are established, the committee discusses and decides which alternatives are best suited to the goals. Probably combining all alternatives in a way that benefits reaching all goals in the least loss-causing way is the best alternative.\n\nThe fifth step of neighborhood planning is to put the plan together. Now that goals and policies have been established, strategies and specific courses of action need to be defined. This involves putting all of the elements together to create a plan.\n\nThe sixth step is to figure out how to implement the plan the committee has created. This requires the planning committee to decide what actions need to take place effectively implement the plan. The committee must decide what resources are available, and how to create more available resources. This step helps decide where funding and financial stability will come from. \n\nThe seventh and final step of neighborhood planning is monitoring, evaluating, and updating your plan. While this may be the final step of neighborhood planning, it does not mean that the planning process is finished. The committee still must decide which parts of the plan work. Plans that do not work should be revised. Because the plan can always be updated and changed, the process is never finished. Planning and sustaining a functional neighborhood involves iterations of work and decision making."], "wikipedia-14658013": ["There are four stages to a Family Group Conference; each stage of the process has equal importance.

The word's history is complicated; it appears to have entered English from Old Irish, possibly via Old Norse, ultimately from the Latin \"crux\" (or its accusative \"crucem\" and its genitive \"crucis\"), \"stake, cross\". The English verb \"to cross\" arises from the noun c. 1200, first in the sense \"to make the sign of the cross\"; the generic meaning \"to intersect\" develops in the 15th century.\n\nLatin \"crux\" referred to the gibbet where criminals were executed, a stake or pole, with or without transom, on which the condemned were impaled or hanged, but more particularly a cross or the pole of a carriage. From this word was derived the Latin verb \"crucio\" \"to put to death on the cross\" or (more frequently) \"to put to the rack, to torture, torment\" especially in reference to mental troubles. The field of etymology is of no help in any effort to trace a supposed original meaning of \"crux\". A \"crux\" can be of various shapes: from a single beam used for impaling or suspending (\"crux simplex\") to the various composite kinds of cross (\"crux compacta\") made from more beams than one. The latter shapes include not only the traditional \u2020-shaped cross (the \"crux immissa\"), but also the T-shaped cross (the \"crux commissa\" or Tau Cross), which the Early Christian descriptions of the execution cross indicate as the normal form in use at that time, and the X-shaped cross (the \"crux decussata\" or saltire).\n\nThe Greek equivalent of Latin \"crux\" \"stake, gibbet\" is \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \"stauros\", found in texts of four centuries or more before the gospels and always in the plural number to indicate a stake or pole. From the first century BC it is used to indicate an instrument used in executions. The Greek word is used in Early Christian descriptions of the execution cross, which indicate that its normal shape was similar to the Greek letter tau (\u03a4).\n\nThe shape of the cross (\"crux\", \"stauros\" \"stake, gibbet\"), as represented by the letter T, came to be used as a \"seal\" or symbol of Early Christianity by the 2nd century. Clement of Alexandria in the early 3rd century calls it (\"the Lord's sign\") he repeats the idea, current as early as the Epistle of Barnabas, that the number 318 (in Greek numerals, \u03a4\u0399\u0397) in Genesis 14:14 was a foreshadowing (a \"type\") of the cross (the letter Tau) and of Jesus (the letters Iota Eta). Clement's contemporary Tertullian rejects the accusation that Christians are \"crucis religiosi\" (i.e. \"adorers of the gibbet\"), and returns the accusation by likening the worship of pagan idols to the worship of poles or stakes. \nIn his book \"De Corona\", written in 204, Tertullian tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross.\n\nWhile early Christians used the T-shape to represent the cross in writing and gesture, the use of the Greek cross and Latin cross, i.e. crosses with intersecting beams, appears in Christian art towards the end of Late Antiquity. An early example of the cruciform halo, used to identify Christ in paintings, is found in the \"Miracles of the Loaves and Fishes\" mosaic of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna (6th century). \nThe Patriarchal cross, a Latin cross with an additional horizontal bar, first appears in the 10th century.\nA wide variation of cross symbols is introduced for the purposes of heraldry beginning in the age of the Crusades."], "wikipedia-5928614": ["The earliest use of the gesture had two people crossing their index fingers to form a cross.\nCharles Panati believes that the act of crossing one's fingers as a sign of luck or making a wish traces back to pre-Christian times, speculating that the cross was a symbol of unity and benign spirits dwelt at the intersection point.

You can view this as five, vertex stacked, icosahedral pyramids, with the five extra annular ring gaps also filled in. The surface is the same as that of ten stacked pentagonal antiprisms. You now have a torus consisting of 150 cells, ten edges long, with 100 exposed triangular faces, 150 exposed edges, and 50 exposed vertices. Stack another tetrahedron on each exposed face. This will give you a somewhat bumpy torus of 250 cells with 50 raised vertices, 50 valley vertices, and 100 valley edges. The valleys are 10 edge long closed paths and correspond to other instances of the 10-vertex decagon path mentioned above. These paths spiral around the center core path, but mathematically they are all equivalent. Build a second identical torus of 250 cells that interlinks with the first. This accounts for 500 cells. These two tori mate together with the valley vertices touching the raised vertices, leaving 100 tetrahedral voids that are filled with the remaining 100 tetrahedra that mate at the valley edges. This latter set of 100 tetrahedra are on the exact boundary of the duocylinder and form a clifford torus. They can be \"unrolled\" into a square 10x10 array. Incidentally this structure forms one tetrahedral layer in the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb. There are exactly 50 \"egg crate\" recesses and peaks on both sides that mate with the 250 cell tori. In this case into each recess, instead of an octahedron as in the honeycomb, fits a triangular bipyramid composed of two tetrahedra."], "wikipedia-19172682": ["The 600-cell partitions into 20 rings of 30 tetrahedra, each a \"Boerdijk\u2013Coxeter helix\".

It is impossible to have all interactions favourable, and the system is frustrated.\n\nGeometrical frustration is also possible if the spins are arranged in a non-collinear way. If we consider a tetrahedron with a spin on each vertex pointing along the \"easy axis\" (that is, directly towards or away from the centre of the tetrahedron), then it is possible to arrange the four spins so that there is no net spin (Figure 3). This is exactly equivalent to having an antiferromagnetic interaction between each pair of spins, so in this case there is no geometrical frustration. With these axes, geometric frustration arises if there is a ferromagnetic interaction between neighbours, where energy is minimized by parallel spins. The best possible arrangement is shown in Figure 4, with two spins pointing towards the centre and two pointing away. The net magnetic moment points upwards, maximising ferromagnetic interactions in this direction, but left and right vectors cancel out (i.e. are antiferromagnetically aligned), as do forwards and backwards. There are three different equivalent arrangements with two spins out and two in, so the ground state is three-fold degenerate."], "wikipedia-14892794": ["It can be constructed by superimposing six tetrahedra within a cube, and then rotating them in pairs about the three axes that pass through the centres of two opposite cubic faces.

While residing in these zones, workers perform the task appropriate to the area they reside. For example, individuals that remain in the center of an ant nest are more likely to feed larvae, whereas individuals found at the periphery of the nest are more likely to forage. E. O. Wilson proposed that by remaining in small, non-random areas inside the nest, the distance an individual moves between tasks may be minimized, and overall colony efficiency would increase.\n\nAccording to the \u201cforaging-for-work\u201d hypothesis, adult workers begin performing tasks in the area of the nest where they emerged, and gradually move towards the periphery of the nest as demands to perform particular tasks change. This hypothesis is based on two observations: \"(1) that there is spatial structure in the layout of tasks in social insect colonies and (2) that workers first become adults in or around the center of the nest\". Individuals can remain in an area for an extended period of time, as long as tasks need to be performed there. Over time, an individual's zone may shift as tasks are accomplished and workers search for other areas where tasks need to be performed. Honey bees, for example, begin their adult life caring for brood located in the area near where they emerged (i.e. nurse bees). Eventually, workers move away from the brood rearing area and begin to perform other tasks, such as food storage, guarding, or foraging.\n\nSpace inside the nest may also be divided as a result of dominance interactions. For example, in paper wasp colonies, a single inseminated queen may found (initiate) a colony after waking up from hibernation (overwintering). However, it is common in many species that multiple inseminated females join these foundresses instead of founding their own nest. When multiple inseminated females found a colony together, the colony grows quickly, yet only one individual will become the primary egg-layer. Through a series of dominance interactions, the most aggressive wasp will emerge as the dominant individual and will become the primary egg-layer for the group (the prime role for ensuring your genes are passed on to subsequent generations), whereas the remaining subordinate wasps will perform other tasks, such as nest construction or foraging. There is evidence that these dominance interactions affect the spatial zones individuals occupy as well. In paper wasps (\"Ropalidia revolutionalis\"), as well as in the ant species \"Odontomachus brunneus\", dominant individuals are more likely to reside in the central areas of the nest, where they take care of brood, while the subordinate individuals are pushed towards the edge, where they are more likely to forage. It is unknown whether division of space or establishment of dominance occurs first and if the other is a result of it."], "wikipedia-1417149": ["The internal structure of the Earth is layered in spherical shells: an outer silicate solid crust, a highly viscous asthenosphere and mantle, a liquid outer core that is much less viscous than the mantle, and a solid inner core.\n\nThe structure of Earth can be defined in two ways: by mechanical properties such as rheology, or chemically.

The geologic component layers of Earth are at the following depths below the surface:\n\nThe crust-mantle boundary occurs as two physically different events. First, there is a discontinuity in the seismic velocity, which is most commonly known as the Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity or Moho. The cause of the Moho is thought to be a change in rock composition from rocks containing plagioclase feldspar (above) to rocks that contain no feldspars (below). Second, in oceanic crust, there is a chemical discontinuity between ultramafic cumulates and tectonized harzburgites, which has been observed from deep parts of the oceanic crust that have been obducted onto the continental crust and preserved as ophiolite sequences.\n\nEarth's mantle extends to a depth of 2,890 km, making it the thickest layer of Earth.

While residing in these zones, workers perform the task appropriate to the area they reside.

What good is it for me?\" She didn't believe in the so-called language talent. She tended to express the language skill and its fruitfulness with a fraction, with \"motivation\" in the numerator (as well as \"invested time,\" although if there is true motivation, one can pinch off some ten minutes a day even with the busiest job), and \"inhibition\" in the denominator (the fear of starting to speak, of being clumsy, of being laughed at).

(This method was, incidentally, applied successfully even before her, by a Hungarian writer, Dezs\u0151 Kosztol\u00e1nyi as well: according to his account, he studied Portuguese practically exactly the same way during a holiday of his.)\n\nAnother keyword of hers was \"context\" (she was playfully called \"Kati Kontext\" herself): on the one hand, in understanding a text (be it a book or a heard text) the context is relevant, it can help us several times if we don't understand something; on the other hand, she never studied words separately, isolated, but they either remained in her mind based on the text she read or the context she encountered (which is perhaps the best possible way of learning), or she memorized them embedded in phrases (e.g. \"high wind\", \"keen wind\"), so if one comes to forget one of them, the other word often used together with it will trigger the former. From adjectival phrases we can even recall the gender in many cases. Kat\u00f3 Lomb recommended using patterns, templates, \"shoemaker's lasts\" or \"cookie-cutters\" elsewhere as well: these are simple, skeletonized sample sentences for a structure or an idiom, elements which can be inserted into the speech like prefabricated slabs (generally in the first person singular), by applying them we can more easily construct even fairly complicated structures.\n\nShe didn't let herself be put off from her set objective by mistakes, failures or the ceaseless demand of perfection, but she always clung to the joyful, enjoyable side of language studies\u2014maybe that's where her success lay. She besieged the fortress of language again and again in a thousand and one ways.

Mark a point somewhere along each connected edge. Draw lines across the connected faces, joining adjacent points around the face. When done, these lines form a complete circuit, i.e. a polygon, around the vertex. This polygon is the vertex figure.\n\nMore precise formal definitions can vary quite widely, according to circumstance. For example Coxeter (e.g. 1948, 1954) varies his definition as convenient for the current area of discussion. Most of the following definitions of a vertex figure apply equally well to infinite tilings or, by extension, to space-filling tessellation with polytope cells and other higher-dimensional polytopes.\n\nSection::::Definitions.:As a flat slice.\nMake a slice through the corner of the polyhedron, cutting through all the edges connected to the vertex. The cut surface is the vertex figure. This is perhaps the most common approach, and the most easily understood. Different authors make the slice in different places. Wenninger (2003) cuts each edge a unit distance from the vertex, as does Coxeter (1948). For uniform polyhedra the Dorman Luke construction cuts each connected edge at its midpoint. Other authors make the cut through the vertex at the other end of each edge.\n\nFor an irregular polyhedron, cutting all edges incident to a given vertex at equal distances from the vertex may produce a figure that does not lie in a plane. A more general approach, valid for arbitrary convex polyhedra, is to make the cut along any plane which separates the given vertex from all the other vertices, but is otherwise arbitrary. This construction determines the combinatorial structure of the vertex figure, similar to a set of connected vertices (see below), but not its precise geometry; it may be generalized to convex polytopes in any dimension. However, for non-convex polyhedra, there may not exist a plane near the vertex that cuts all of the faces incident to the vertex.\n\nSection::::Definitions.:As a spherical polygon.\nCromwell (1999) forms the vertex figure by intersecting the polyhedron with a sphere centered at the vertex, small enough that it intersects only edges and faces incident to the vertex. This can be visualized as making a spherical cut or scoop, centered on the vertex. The cut surface or vertex figure is thus a spherical polygon marked on this sphere. One advantage of this method is that the shape of the vertex figure is fixed (up to the scale of the sphere), whereas the method of intersecting with a plane can produce different shapes depending on the angle of the plane. Additionally, this method works for non-convex polyhedra."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-518693": 1, "wikipedia-31591175": 1, "wikipedia-39781": 1, "wikipedia-23470": 1, "wikipedia-1005719": 1, "wikipedia-31112": 1, "wikipedia-2720430": 1, "wikipedia-40146883": 1, "wikipedia-4224429": 1, "wikipedia-12158034": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-518693": 1, "wikipedia-31591175": 1, "wikipedia-39781": 1, "wikipedia-23470": 1, "wikipedia-1005719": 2, "wikipedia-31112": 1, "wikipedia-2720430": 1, "wikipedia-40146883": 1, "wikipedia-4224429": 1, "wikipedia-12158034": 1}}}

The words projected/projection here refer to the use of graphics\u2019 lines in the protocol to simulate light ray traces from a Station Point (a supposed observer\u00b4s location) to the edges and corners of an object in space, creating thereby or by their extension, an image at the lines\u2019 points of intersection with a Projection Plane.\nNo type of projection can perfectly map the imagery of three dimensional space onto a projection plane because of the image's (mapped on the retina-sphere) undevelopability. This is a distortion of the drawing in itself called perspective projection distortion, and refers to the difference between the drawing and the way the objects depicted on it would look if it was real, but there is another distortion caused by the difference between the location of the supposed observer situated for the drawing process and the location of the real observer of the drawing. These two distortions exist simultaneously. In the special case \u2014 and the only instance \u2014 in which perspective imagery appears affected only by the perspective projection distortion, the real observer must view the perspective imagery from precisely the supposed station point of the perspective.\nReal human vision and perspective projection should (unless it is otherwise desired) look the same. The difference should be imperceptible. The base to rate the quality of the perspective projection is the real vision and the difference between them is the perspective projection distortion. Normal human vision should not be considered to present any distortion unless a disturbing factor is involved. Distortion in human vision appears when there is a visual problem involved. The use of lenses can also cause, modify or avoid these distortions.

When applied to the real world this principle has many implications which are important in fields ranging from mechanical engineering to biomechanics. It helps explain phenomena including why large mammals like elephants have a harder time cooling themselves than small ones like mice, and why building taller and taller skyscrapers is increasingly difficult.\nSection::::Description.\nThe square\u2013cube law can be stated as follows:\nRepresented mathematically:\nwhere formula_2 is the original surface area and formula_3 is the new surface area.\nwhere formula_5 is the original volume, formula_6 is the new volume, formula_7 is the original length and formula_8 is the new length.\nFor example, a cube with a side length of 1 meter has a surface area of 6 m and a volume of 1 m. If the dimensions of the cube were multiplied by 2, its surface area would be multiplied by the \"square\" of 2 and become 24 m. Its volume would be multiplied by the \"cube\" of 2 and become 8 m. \nThe original cube (1m sides) has a surface area to volume ratio of 6:1. The larger (2m sides) cube has a surface area to volume ratio of (24/8) 3:1. As the dimensions increase, the volume will continue to grow faster than the surface area. Thus the square\u2013cube law.

The mathematical approach commonly taken decides among a set of candidate models; this set must be chosen by the researcher.

What is meant by \"best\" is controversial. A good model selection technique will balance goodness of fit with simplicity . More complex models will be better able to adapt their shape to fit the data (for example, a fifth-order polynomial can exactly fit six points), but the additional parameters may not represent anything useful. (Perhaps those six points are really just randomly distributed about a straight line.)

Visualization: At this level, the focus of a child's thinking is on individual shapes, which the child is learning to classify by judging their holistic appearance. Children simply say, \"That is a circle,\" usually without further description. Children identify prototypes of basic geometrical figures (triangle, circle, square). These visual prototypes are then used to identify other shapes. A shape is a circle because it looks like a sun; a shape is a rectangle because it looks like a door or a box; and so on. A square seems to be a different sort of shape than a rectangle, and a rhombus does not look like other parallelograms, so these shapes are classified completely separately in the child\u2019s mind. Children view figures holistically without analyzing their properties. If a shape does not sufficiently resemble its prototype, the child may reject the classification. Thus, children at this stage might balk at calling a thin, wedge-shaped triangle (with sides 1, 20, 20 or sides 20, 20, 39) a \"triangle\", because it's so different in shape from an equilateral triangle, which is the usual prototype for \"triangle\". If the horizontal base of the triangle is on top and the opposing vertex below, the child may recognize it as a triangle, but claim it is \"upside down\". Shapes with rounded or incomplete sides may be accepted as \"triangles\" if they bear a holistic resemblance to an equilateral triangle. Squares are called \"diamonds\" and not recognized as squares if their sides are oriented at 45\u00b0 to the horizontal. Children at this level often believe something is true based on a single example.\nLevel 1. Analysis: At this level, the shapes become bearers of their properties. The objects of thought are classes of shapes, which the child has learned to analyze as having properties. A person at this level might say, \"A square has 4 equal sides and 4 equal angles. Its diagonals are congruent and perpendicular, and they bisect each other.\" The properties are more important than the appearance of the shape. If a figure is sketched on the blackboard and the teacher claims it is intended to have congruent sides and angles, the students accept that it is a square, even if it is poorly drawn. Properties are not yet ordered at this level. Children can discuss the properties of the basic figures and recognize them by these properties, but generally do not allow categories to overlap because they understand each property in isolation from the others. For example, they will still insist that \"a square is not a rectangle.\" (They may introduce extraneous properties to support such beliefs, such as defining a rectangle as a shape with one pair of sides longer than the other pair of sides.) Children begin to notice many properties of shapes, but do not see the relationships between the properties; therefore they cannot reduce the list of properties to a concise definition with necessary and sufficient conditions. They usually reason inductively from several examples, but cannot yet reason deductively because they do not understand how the properties of shapes are related."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-207074": 1, "wikipedia-5731861": 1, "wikipedia-22833268": 1, "wikipedia-43072303": 1, "wikipedia-31136207": 1, "wikipedia-46394651": 1, "wikipedia-20790053": 1, "wikipedia-15261672": 1, "wikipedia-99494": 1, "wikipedia-11300": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-207074": 1, "wikipedia-5731861": 2, "wikipedia-22833268": 1, "wikipedia-43072303": 1, "wikipedia-31136207": 1, "wikipedia-46394651": 1, "wikipedia-20790053": 1, "wikipedia-15261672": 1, "wikipedia-99494": 1, "wikipedia-11300": 1}}}

While Wikipedia might not provide detailed step-by-step instructions for specific shapes, it can offer foundational techniques and terminology that are essential for understanding the process of folding and manipulating paper.", "wikipedia-193590": ["Section::::Origami symbols.:Basic folds.\nBULLET::::- A thick line shows the edge of the paper\nBULLET::::- A dashed line shows a valley fold. The paper is folded in front of itself.\nBULLET::::- A dashed and dotted line shows a mountain fold (there may be one or two dots per dash depending on the author). The paper is folded behind itself, this is normally done by turning the paper over, folding a valley fold and then turning the paper back over again.\nBULLET::::- A thin line shows where a previous fold has creased the paper.\nBULLET::::- A dotted line shows a previous fold that's hidden behind other paper, or sometimes shows a fold that's not yet made.\n\nSection::::Origami symbols.:Common operations.\nThe operations shown here are all fairly common. The pleat folds and reverse folds are often done with the two creases at an angle. Reverse folds of a corner are typically used to produce feet or birds heads.\nThe sink fold is considered an intermediary to high skill. The version shown here is called an open sink and there is another version called a closed sink which generates a triangular pocket with no flaps showing. In simple cases the model can be partly unfolded and then folded with the sink in place.\n\nSection::::Compound folds.\nBULLET::::- A squash fold starts with a flap with at least two layers (for example, one flap of a waterbomb base). Make a radial fold from the closed point down the center of this flap. Open the flap and refold downward to make two adjacent flaps.\nBULLET::::- A rabbit ear fold starts with a reference crease down a diagonal. Fold two radial folds from opposite corners along the same side of the reference crease; the resulting flap should be folded downwards so that the previous edges are aligned.\nBULLET::::- A petal fold starts with two connected flaps, each of which has at least two layers. (For example, two flaps of a preliminary base). The two flaps are attached to each other along a reference crease. Make two radial folds from the open point, so that the open edges lie along the reference crease. Unfold these two radial folds. Make another fold across the top connecting the ends of the creases to create a triangle of creases. Unfold this fold as well. Fold one layer of the open point upward and flatten it using the existing creases. A petal fold is equivalent to two side-by-side rabbit ears, which are connected along the reference crease.\n\nSection::::Origami bases.\nIn origami, there is a series of several bases that many models are created with. In general, \"base\" refers to any folded paper that immediately precedes final folding and shaping of the model-to-be. The ones listed below are generally accepted as the traditional origami bases.\nBULLET::::- A blintz base is made by folding the corners of a square into the center. The resulting square can then be used as the starting point for any base or blintzed again. The resulting base will then have more points available for folding.\nBULLET::::- The kite base is merely two valley folds that bring two adjacent edges of the square together to lie on the square's diagonal.\nBULLET::::- The fish base consists of two radial folds against a diagonal reference crease on each of two opposite corners. The flaps that result on the other two corners are carefully folded downwards in the same direction. In other words, it consists of two side-by-side rabbit ears.\nBULLET::::- The waterbomb base consists of two perpendicular valley folds down the diagonals of the square and two perpendicular mountain folds down the center of the square. This crease pattern is then compressed to form the waterbomb base, which is an isosceles-right triangle with four isosceles-right triangular flaps. The waterbomb base is an inside-out preliminary fold.\nBULLET::::- The preliminary fold consists of two perpendicular diagonal mountain folds that bisect the corners of the square and two perpendicular valley folds that bisect the edges of the square. The paper is then collapsed to form a square shape with four isosceles-right triangular flaps. It is sometimes called the Square Base\nBULLET::::- The bird base, or crane base, consists of a preliminary fold with both the front and the back sides petal folded upward.\nBULLET::::- The frog base starts with a waterbomb base or preliminary fold. All four flaps are squash-folded (the result is the same in either case), and then the corners are petal folded upward.\n\nSection::::More advanced skills.\nBULLET::::- The Swivel fold is difficult to describe as the term is loosely defined and there are so many different versions that could be called \"swivel folds\". However, generally swivel folds involve a flap of paper \"swivelling\" at a certain point or vertex and another flap or edge of paper, connected to the first, dragged around that point or vertex.\nBULLET::::- Most of the creases in a stretched bird base are present in the regular bird base. When forming this bird base, make sure to crease the triangle at the center corner through all layers. (If you unfold completely, you will see a small square at the center of the paper.) After forming the bird base, either partially unfold the paper, and/or \"stretch\" two opposite corners of the bird base. These two corners, their associated flaps, and the central square will all lie flat. The other two flaps will form a pyramid. Rabbit ear each flap that is in the pyramid, so that the model lies flat. All of the raw edges will lie along the centerline of the model. The stretched bird base is used in Lang's \"Bald Eagle\", Greenberg's \"Eeyore\", and some other high-intermediate and complex models.\nBULLET::::- The open sink usually involves opening out the paper, and reversing creases to make a waterbomb base in the middle of the model.\nBULLET::::- The open double sink is equivalent to making an open sink, and then open-sinking the point in the opposite direction. It is a sinked analog of the crimp fold. When made in a single step (after pre-creasing), it can be easier to make than a single open sink, because it does not require neatly reversing the point. The open double sink is used in many box-pleated models.\nBULLET::::- The spread squash can similarly be considered the sinked analog of the squash fold. It is used to flatten a closed flap or twist fold (see below). Instead of creating a long point to one side of the flap's base, the spread squash creates a wide splat around the flap's base. The spread squash is used in the eyes of Engel's \"Octopus\", in \"Marie's Rose\", and in some other intermediate and complex models.\nBULLET::::- The closed sink simultaneously makes a locking flap inside of a sink. It is difficult because the paper cannot be opened out further than a triangle. This technique is illustrated in the Origami Forum's thread #462. The closed sink appears in some high-intermediate and complex models.\nBULLET::::- The twist fold involves, as the name implies, twisting a section of the paper with respect to its original position. The section twisted will be a polygon; the numerous required support creases include pleat folds radiating from its corners."], "wikipedia-3645432": ["BULLET::::1. The corners of a sheet of paper are folded up to meet the opposite sides and (if the paper is not already square) the top is cut off, making a square sheet with diagonal creases.\nBULLET::::2.

The resulting smaller square is turned over, and the four corners are folded in a second time.\nBULLET::::3.

Each line represents one of the four classical elements: from top to bottom, the lines represent fire, air, water, and earth. When a line has a single point, the element is said to be active; otherwise, with two points, the element is passive. Because there are four lines, and since each line can be either active or passive, there are 2, or 16, different figures. The different combinations of elements yields different representations or manifestations of the figure's energy.\nEach figure can be said to have a ruling element, whereby that element's energy and manifestations correlates most closely to the figure itself. With the exception of Populus, the ruling element for each figure is always represented as active (a single point in the corresponding line). For figures with only one active element, that element by default is its ruling element; other combinations of active and passive elements require more introspection to assign rulerships. Populus, consisting of all passive lines, is ruled by Water by its nature of being entirely passive and taking on the reflective qualities of water whenever an outside force acts upon it. \nWhile the elements just described are from the geomantic tradition, another set of elemental assignments are used based on the figures' astrological connections. These elements are assigned based on the zodiac sign of a given figure. The geomantic element is said to reflect the nature of a figure when viewed alone; the astrological element reflects its nature when acting with other figures.\nAnother classification of the geomantic figures involves their quality, which is either \"stable\" or \"mobile\". The quality of a figure represents its duration of effect or motion, such that a figure with a stable quality will represent a long-term situation or that a certain object remains where it was left, while a mobile figure represents a transient effect upon the real world. In simple \"yes or no\" style divinations, stable figures indicate a positive answer, while mobile figures indicate a negative one.\nOriginally, the quality was shown in terms of \"entering\" or \"exiting\" figures, where, from the viewer's point of view, the figure would be pointing towards (downward) or away from (upward) the viewer. Entering figures have the stable quality, while the exiting figures have the mobile quality; when an entering figure is rotated upside-down, it becomes an exiting figure, and vice versa. However, based on this classification, the four figures that point in both directions regardless of rotation have the quality of both entering and exiting, and must be evaluated in terms of its neighbors or generating figures.\nIn the generation of the geomantic charts, the primary answer is given by the figure called the Judge. Based upon the mathematics involved in generating the charts, the Judge figure must always have an even number of points. For this reason, all the figures that can appear as Judges (i.e. have an even number of points) are also termed \"impartial\" figures; they represent objective states of the world observable equally by any party.

This theory, subsequently referred to as \"translation-rotation\", \"ranks with the writings of Mondrian and Malevich\", writes art historian Daniel Robbins, \"as one of the most thorough expositions of the principles of abstract art, which in his case entailed the rejection not only of representation but also of geometric forms\". \nBeginning with a central rectangle, taken as an example of elementary form, Gleizes points out two mechanical ways of juxtaposing form to create a painting: (1) either by reproducing the initial form (employing various symmetries such as reflectional, rotational or translational), or by modifying (or not) its dimensions. (2) By displacement of the initial form; pivoting around an imaginary axis in one direction or another. \nThe choice of position (through translation and/or rotation), though based on the inspiration of the artist, is no longer attributed to the anecdotal. An objective and rigorous method, independent of the painter, replaces emotion or sensibility in the determination the placement of form, that is through \"translation\" and \"rotation\". \nSpace and rhythm, according to Gleizes, are perceptible by the extent of movement (displacement) of planar surfaces. These elemental transformations modify the position and importance of the initial plane, whether they converge or diverge ('recede' or 'advance') from the eye, creating a series of new and separate spatial planes appreciable physiologically by the observer. \nAnother movement is added to the first movement of translation of the plane to one side: Rotation of the plane. Fig. I shows the resulting formation that follows from simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the initial plane produced on the axis. Fig II and Fig. III represent the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle, inclined to the right and to the left. The axis point at which movement is realized is established by the observer. Fig. IV represents the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle plane, with the position of the eye of the observed displaced left of the axis. Displacement toward the right (though not represented) is straightforward enough to imagine. \nWith these figures Gleizes attempts to present, under the most simple conditions possible (simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane), the creation of a spatial and rhythmic organism (Fig. VIII), with practically no initiative taken on the part of the artist who controls the evolutionary process. The planar surfaces of Fig. VIII are filled with hatching espousing the 'direction' of the planes. What emerges in the inert plane, according to Gleizes, through the movement followed by the eye of the observer, is \"a visible imprint of successive stages of which the initial rhythmic cadence coordinated a succession of differing states\". These successive stages permit the perception of space. The initial state, by consequence of the transformation, has become a spatial and rhythmic organism. \nFig. I and Fig. II obtain mechanically, Gleizes writes, with minimal personal initiative, a \"plastic spatial and rhythmic system\", by the conjugation of simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane and from the movements of translation of the plane to one side. The result is a spatial and rhythmic organism more \"complex\" than shown in Fig. VIII; demonstrating through mechanical, purely plastic means, the realization of a material universe independent of intentional intervention by the artist. This is sufficient to demonstrate, according to Gleizes, the \"possibilities of the plane\" to serve spatially and rhythmically by its own power.

However, instead of space and time, these equations show how light can be directed in a chosen manner, analogous to warping space. For example, one potential application is collecting sunlight with novel solar cells by concentrating the light in one area. Hence, a wide array of conventional devices could be markedly enhanced by applying transformation optics.\n\nTransformation optics subscribes to the capability of bending light, or electromagnetic waves and energy, in any preferred or desired fashion, for a desired application. Maxwell's equations do not vary even though coordinates transform. Instead values of chosen parameters of materials \"transform\", or alter, during a certain time period. Transformation optics developed from the capability to choose which parameters for a given material, known as a metamaterial. Hence, since Maxwell's equations retain the same form, it is the successive values of permittivity and permeability that change, over time. Permittivity and permeability are in a sense responses to the electric and magnetic fields of a radiated light source respectively, among other descriptions. The precise degree of electric and magnetic response can be controlled in a metamaterial, point by point. Since so much control can be maintained over the responses of the material, this leads to an enhanced and highly flexible gradient-index material. Conventionally predetermined refractive index of ordinary materials become independent spatial gradients, that can be controlled at will. Therefore, transformation optics is a new method for creating novel and unique optical devices.\n\nIf a coordinate transformation can be derived or described, a ray of light (in the optical limit) will follow lines of a constant coordinate. There are constraints on the transformations, as listed in the references. In general, however, a particular goal can be accomplished using more than one transformation. The classic cylindrical cloak (first both simulated and demonstrated experimentally) can be created with many transformations. The simplest, and most often used, is a linear coordinate mapping in the radial coordinate. There is significant ongoing research into determining advantages and disadvantages of particular types of transformations, and what attributes are desirable for realistic transformations. One example of this is the broadband carpet cloak: the transformation used was quasi-conformal. Such a transformation can yield a cloak that uses non-extreme values of permittivity and permeability, unlike the classic cylindrical cloak, which required some parameters to vary towards infinity at the inner radius of the cloak.\n\nGeneral coordinate transformations can be derived which compress or expand space, bend or twist space, or even change the topology (e.g. by mimicking a wormhole).

The fact that these objects transform according to the Lorentz transformation is what mathematically \"defines\" them as vectors and tensors; see tensor for a definition.\nGiven the components of the four vectors or tensors in some frame, the \"transformation rule\" allows one to determine the altered components of the same four vectors or tensors in another frame, which could be boosted or accelerated, relative to the original frame. A \"boost\" should not be conflated with spatial translation, rather it's characterized by the relative velocity between frames. The transformation rule itself depends on the relative motion of the frames. In the simplest case of two inertial frames the relative velocity between enters the transformation rule.

In essence, the Galilean transformations embody the intuitive notion of addition and subtraction of velocities as vectors.\nThe notation below describes the relationship under the Galilean transformation between the coordinates and of a single arbitrary event, as measured in two coordinate systems S and S', in uniform relative motion (velocity \"v\") in their common \"x\" and \"x\"\u2032 directions, with their spatial origins coinciding at time :\nNote that the last equation expresses the assumption of a universal time independent of the relative motion of different observers.\nIn the language of linear algebra, this transformation is considered a shear mapping, and is described with a matrix acting on a vector. With motion parallel to the \"x\"-axis, the transformation acts on only two components:\nThough matrix representations are not strictly necessary for Galilean transformation, they provide the means for direct comparison to transformation methods in special relativity.\nSection::::Galilean transformations.\nThe Galilean symmetries can be uniquely written as the composition of a \"rotation\", a \"translation\" and a \"uniform motion\" of spacetime. Let represent a point in three-dimensional space, and a point in one-dimensional time. A general point in spacetime is given by an ordered pair .\nA uniform motion, with velocity , is given by \nwhere . A translation is given by\nwhere and . A rotation is given by\nwhere is an orthogonal transformation.\nAs a Lie group, the group of Galilean transformations has dimension 10."], "wikipedia-46904771": ["Beginning with a central rectangle, taken as an example of elementary form, Gleizes points out two mechanical ways of juxtaposing form to create a painting: (1) either by reproducing the initial form (employing various symmetries such as reflectional, rotational or translational), or by modifying (or not) its dimensions. (2) By displacement of the initial form; pivoting around an imaginary axis in one direction or another.\n\nThe choice of position (through translation and/or rotation), though based on the inspiration of the artist, is no longer attributed to the anecdotal. An objective and rigorous method, independent of the painter, replaces emotion or sensibility in the determination the placement of form, that is through \"translation\" and \"rotation\".\n\nSchematic illustrations:\nSpace and rhythm, according to Gleizes, are perceptible by the extent of movement (displacement) of planar surfaces. These elemental transformations modify the position and importance of the initial plane, whether they converge or diverge ('recede' or 'advance') from the eye, creating a series of new and separate spatial planes appreciable physiologically by the observer.\n\nAnother movement is added to the first movement of translation of the plane to one side: Rotation of the plane. Fig. I shows the resulting formation that follows from simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the initial plane produced on the axis. Fig II and Fig. III represent the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle, inclined to the right and to the left. The axis point at which movement is realized is established by the observer. Fig. IV represents the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle plane, with the position of the eye of the observed displaced left of the axis. Displacement toward the right (though not represented) is straightforward enough to imagine.\n\nWith these figures Gleizes attempts to present, under the most simple conditions possible (simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane), the creation of a spatial and rhythmic organism (Fig. VIII), with practically no initiative taken on the part of the artist who controls the evolutionary process. The planar surfaces of Fig. VIII are filled with hatching espousing the 'direction' of the planes. What emerges in the inert plane, according to Gleizes, through the movement followed by the eye of the observer, is \"a visible imprint of successive stages of which the initial rhythmic cadence coordinated a succession of differing states\". These successive stages permit the perception of space. The initial state, by consequence of the transformation, has become a spatial and rhythmic organism.\n\nFig. I and Fig. II obtain mechanically, Gleizes writes, with minimal personal initiative, a \"plastic spatial and rhythmic system\", by the conjugation of simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane and from the movements of translation of the plane to one side. The result is a spatial and rhythmic organism more \"complex\" than shown in Fig. VIII; demonstrating through mechanical, purely plastic means, the realization of a material universe independent of intentional intervention by the artist. This is sufficient to demonstrate, according to Gleizes, the \"possibilities of the plane\" to serve spatially and rhythmically by its own power.

Time is used as fourth dimension as in Minkowski space, so spherical wave transformations are connected to the Lorentz transformation of special relativity, and it turns out that the spacetime conformal group includes the Lorentz group and the Poincar\u00e9 group as subgroups. However, only the Lorentz/Poincar\u00e9 groups represent symmetries of all laws of nature including mechanics, whereas the conformal group is related to certain areas such as electrodynamics. In addition, it can be shown that the conformal group of the plane (corresponding to the M\u00f6bius group of the extended complex plane) is isomorphic to the Lorentz group.\nA special case of Lie sphere geometry is the transformation by reciprocal directions or Laguerre inversion, being a generator of the Laguerre group.

Topologically, the surfaces of such polyhedra are torus surfaces having one or more holes through the middle.\nSection::::Other important families of polyhedra.:Space-filling polyhedra.\nA space-filling polyhedron packs with copies of itself to fill space. Such a close-packing or space-filling is often called a tessellation of space or a honeycomb. Space-filling polyhedra must have a Dehn invariant equal to zero. Some honeycombs involve more than one kind of polyhedron.\nSection::::Other important families of polyhedra.:Lattice polyhedra.\nA convex polyhedron in which all vertices have integer coordinates is called a lattice polyhedron or integral polyhedron. The Ehrhart polynomial of a lattice polyhedron counts how many points with integer coordinates lie within a scaled copy of the polyhedron, as a function of the scale factor. The study of these polynomials lies at the intersection of combinatorics and commutative algebra.\nSection::::Other important families of polyhedra.:Flexible polyhedra.\nIt is possible for some polyhedra to change their overall shape, while keeping the shapes of their faces the same, by varying the angles of their edges. A polyhedron that can do this is called a flexible polyhedron. By Cauchy's rigidity theorem, flexible polyhedra must be non-convex. The volume of a flexible polyhedron must remain constant as it flexes; this result is known as the bellows theorem.\nSection::::Other important families of polyhedra.:Compounds.\nA polyhedral compound is made of two or more polyhedra sharing a common centre. Symmetrical compounds often share the same vertices as other well-known polyhedra and may often also be formed by stellation. Some are listed in the list of Wenninger polyhedron models.\nSection::::Other important families of polyhedra.:Orthogonal polyhedra.\nAn orthogonal polyhedron is one all of whose faces meet at right angles, and all of whose edges are parallel to axes of a Cartesian coordinate system. Aside from the rectangular boxes, orthogonal polyhedra are nonconvex. They are the 3D analogs of 2D orthogonal polygons, also known as rectilinear polygons. Orthogonal polyhedra are used in computational geometry, where their constrained structure has enabled advances on problems unsolved for arbitrary polyhedra, for example, unfolding the surface of a polyhedron to a polygonal net."], "wikipedia-39781140": ["In mathematics, and more specifically in polyhedral combinatorics, a Goldberg polyhedron is a convex polyhedron made from hexagons and pentagons. They were first described by Michael Goldberg (1902\u20131990) in 1937. They are defined by three properties: each face is either a pentagon or hexagon, exactly three faces meet at each vertex, and they have rotational icosahedral symmetry. They are not necessarily mirror-symmetric; e.g. \"GP\"(5,3) and \"GP\"(3,5) are enantiomorphs of each other. A consequence of Euler's polyhedron formula is that there will be exactly twelve pentagons.\nIcosahedral symmetry ensures that the pentagons are always regular, although many of the hexagons may not be. Typically all of the vertices lie on a sphere, but they can also be computed as equilateral.\nIt is a dual polyhedron of a geodesic sphere, with all triangle faces and 6 triangles per vertex, except for 12 vertices with 5 triangles.\nSimple examples of Goldberg polyhedra include the dodecahedron and truncated icosahedron. Other forms can be described by taking a chess knight move from one pentagon to the next: first take \"m\" steps in one direction, then turn 60\u00b0 to the left and take \"n\" steps. Such a polyhedron is denoted \"GP\"(\"m\",\"n\"). A dodecahedron is \"GP\"(1,0) and a truncated icosahedron is \"GP\"(1,1).\nA similar technique can be applied to construct polyhedra with tetrahedral symmetry and octahedral symmetry. These polyhedra will have triangles or squares rather than pentagons. These variations are given Roman numeral subscripts denoting the number of sides on the non-hexagon faces: GP(n,m), GP(n,m), and GP(n,m)."], "wikipedia-246092": ["Modular origami forms may be flat or three-dimensional. Flat forms are usually polygons (sometimes known as coasters), stars, rotors, and rings. Three-dimensional forms tend to be regular polyhedra or tessellations of simple polyhedra.\n\nNeale developed a system to model equilateral polyhedra based on a module with variable vertex angles. Each module has two pockets and two tabs, on opposite sides. The angle of each tab can be changed independently of the other tab. Each pocket can receive tabs of any angle. The most common angles form polygonal faces:\nBULLET::::- 60 degrees (triangle)\nBULLET::::- 90 degrees (square)\nBULLET::::- 108 degrees (pentagon)\nBULLET::::- 120 degrees (hexagon)\nEach module joins others at the vertices of a polyhedron to form a polygonal face. the tabs form angles on opposite sides of an edge. For example, a subassembly of three triangle corners forms a triangle, the most stable configuration. As the internal angle increases for squares, pentagons and so forth, the stability decreases.\n\nMany polyhedra call for unalike adjacent polygons. for example, a pyramid has one square face and four triangular faces. This requires hybrid modules, or modules having different angles. A pyramid consists of eight modules, four modules as square-triangle, and four as triangle-triangle.\n\nFurther polygonal faces are possible by altering the angle at each corner. The Neale modules can form any equilateral polyhedron including those having rhombic faces, like the rhombic dodecahedron."], "wikipedia-23621": ["Polygon\nIn elementary geometry, a polygon () is a plane figure that is described by a finite number of straight line segments connected to form a closed polygonal chain or \"polygonal circuit\". The solid plane region, the bounding circuit, or the two together, may be called a polygon.\nThe segments of a polygonal circuit are called its \"edges\" or \"sides\", and the points where two edges meet are the polygon's \"vertices\" (singular: vertex) or \"corners\". The interior of a solid polygon is sometimes called its \"body\". An \"n\"-gon is a polygon with \"n\" sides; for example, a triangle is a 3-gon.\nA simple polygon is one which does not intersect itself. Mathematicians are often concerned only with the bounding polygonal chains of simple polygons and they often define a polygon accordingly. A polygonal boundary may be allowed to cross over itself, creating star polygons and other self-intersecting polygons.\nA polygon is a 2-dimensional example of the more general polytope in any number of dimensions. There are many more generalizations of polygons defined for different purposes.\nSection::::Classification.:Number of sides.\nPolygons are primarily classified by the number of sides. See the table below.\nSection::::Classification.:Convexity and non-convexity.\nPolygons may be characterized by their convexity or type of non-convexity:\nBULLET::::- Convex: any line drawn through the polygon (and not tangent to an edge or corner) meets its boundary exactly twice. As a consequence, all its interior angles are less than 180\u00b0. Equivalently, any line segment with endpoints on the boundary passes through only interior points between its endpoints.\nBULLET::::- Non-convex: a line may be found which meets its boundary more than twice. Equivalently, there exists a line segment between two boundary points that passes outside the polygon.\nBULLET::::- Simple: the boundary of the polygon does not cross itself. All convex polygons are simple.\nBULLET::::- Concave: Non-convex and simple. There is at least one interior angle greater than 180\u00b0.\nBULLET::::- Star-shaped: the whole interior is visible from at least one point, without crossing any edge. The polygon must be simple, and may be convex or concave. All convex polygons are star-shaped.\nBULLET::::- Self-intersecting: the boundary of the polygon crosses itself. The term \"complex\" is sometimes used in contrast to \"simple\", but this usage risks confusion with the idea of a \"complex polygon\" as one which exists in the complex Hilbert plane consisting of two complex dimensions.\nBULLET::::- Star polygon: a polygon which self-intersects in a regular way. A polygon cannot be both a star and star-shaped.\nSection::::Classification.:Equality and symmetry.\nBULLET::::- Equiangular: all corner angles are equal.\nBULLET::::- Cyclic: all corners lie on a single circle, called the circumcircle.\nBULLET::::- Isogonal or vertex-transitive: all corners lie within the same symmetry orbit. The polygon is also cyclic and equiangular.\nBULLET::::- Equilateral: all edges are of the same length. The polygon need not be convex.\nBULLET::::- Tangential: all sides are tangent to an inscribed circle.\nBULLET::::- Isotoxal or edge-transitive: all sides lie within the same symmetry orbit. The polygon is also equilateral and tangential.\nBULLET::::- Regular: the polygon is both \"isogonal\" and \"isotoxal\". Equivalently, it is both \"cyclic\" and \"equilateral\", or both \"equilateral\" and \"equiangular\". A non-convex regular polygon is called a \"regular star polygon\".\nSection::::Classification.:Miscellaneous.\nBULLET::::- Rectilinear: the polygon's sides meet at right angles, i.e., all its interior angles are 90 or 270 degrees.\nBULLET::::- Monotone with respect to a given line \"L\": every line orthogonal to L intersects the polygon not more than twice.\nSection::::Properties and formulas.:Angles.\nAny polygon has as many corners as it has sides. Each corner has several angles. The two most important ones are:\nBULLET::::- Interior angle \u2013 The sum of the interior angles of a simple \"n\"-gon is radians or degrees. This is because any simple \"n\"-gon ( having \"n\" sides ) can be considered to be made up of triangles, each of which has an angle sum of \u03c0 radians or 180 degrees. The measure of any interior angle of a convex regular \"n\"-gon is formula_1 radians or formula_2 degrees. The interior angles of regular star polygons were first studied by Poinsot, in the same paper in which he describes the four regular star polyhedra: for a regular formula_3-gon (a \"p\"-gon with central density \"q\"), each interior angle is formula_4 radians or formula_5 degrees.\nBULLET::::- Exterior angle \u2013 The exterior angle is the supplementary angle to the interior angle. Tracing around a convex \"n\"-gon, the angle \"turned\" at a corner is the exterior or external angle. Tracing all the way around the polygon makes one full turn, so the sum of the exterior angles must be 360\u00b0. This argument can be generalized to concave simple polygons, if external angles that turn in the opposite direction are subtracted from the total turned. Tracing around an \"n\"-gon in general, the sum of the exterior angles (the total amount one rotates at the vertices) can be any integer multiple \"d\" of 360\u00b0, e.g. 720\u00b0 for a pentagram and 0\u00b0 for an angular \"eight\" or antiparallelogram, where \"d\" is the density or starriness of the polygon. See also orbit (dynamics).\nSection::::Properties and formulas.:Area.\nIn this section, the vertices of the polygon under consideration are taken to be formula_6 in order. For convenience in some formulas, the notation will also be used.\nIf the polygon is non-self-intersecting (that is, simple), the signed area is\nor, using determinants\nwhere formula_9 is the squared distance between formula_10 and formula_11 \nThe signed area depends on the ordering of the vertices and of the orientation of the plane. Commonly, the positive orientation is defined by the (counterclockwise) rotation that maps the positive -axis to the positive -axis. If the vertices are ordered counterclockwise (that is, according to positive orientation), the signed area is positive; otherwise, it is negative. In either case, the area formula is correct in absolute value. This is commonly called the shoelace formula or Surveyor's formula.\nThe area \"A\" of a simple polygon can also be computed if the lengths of the sides, \"a\", \"a\", ..., \"a\" and the exterior angles, \"\u03b8\", \"\u03b8\", ..., \"\u03b8\" are known, from:\nThe formula was described by Lopshits in 1963.\nIf the polygon can be drawn on an equally spaced grid such that all its vertices are grid points, Pick's theorem gives a simple formula for the polygon's area based on the numbers of interior and boundary grid points: the former number plus one-half the latter number, minus 1.\nIn every polygon with perimeter \"p\" and area \"A \", the isoperimetric inequality formula_13 holds.\nFor any two simple polygons of equal area, the Bolyai\u2013Gerwien theorem asserts that the first can be cut into polygonal pieces which can be reassembled to form the second polygon.\nThe lengths of the sides of a polygon do not in general determine its area. However, if the polygon is cyclic then the sides \"do\" determine the area. Of all \"n\"-gons with given side lengths, the one with the largest area is cyclic. Of all \"n\"-gons with a given perimeter, the one with the largest area is regular (and therefore cyclic).\nSection::::Properties and formulas.:Area.:Regular polygons.\nMany specialized formulas apply to the areas of regular polygons.\nThe area of a regular polygon is given in terms of the radius \"r\" of its inscribed circle and its perimeter \"p\" by \nThis radius is also termed its apothem and is often represented as \"a\".\nThe area of a regular \"n\"-gon with side \"s"], "wikipedia-23905": ["BULLET::::- Triangular faces: Each vertex of a regular triangle is 60\u00b0, so a shape may have 3, 4, or 5 triangles meeting at a vertex; these are the tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively.\nBULLET::::- Square faces: Each vertex of a square is 90\u00b0, so there is only one arrangement possible with three faces at a vertex, the cube.\nBULLET::::- Pentagonal faces: Each vertex is 108\u00b0; again, only one arrangement of three faces at a vertex is possible, the dodecahedron.\nSection::::Geometric properties.:Angles.\nThere are a number of angles associated with each Platonic solid. The dihedral angle is the interior angle between any two face planes. The dihedral angle, \"\u03b8\", of the solid {\"p\",\"q\"} is given by the formula\nThis is sometimes more conveniently expressed in terms of the tangent by\nThe quantity \"h\" (called the Coxeter number) is 4, 6, 6, 10, and 10 for the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron respectively.\nThe angular deficiency at the vertex of a polyhedron is the difference between the sum of the face-angles at that vertex and 2. The defect, \"\u03b4\", at any vertex of the Platonic solids {\"p\",\"q\"} is\nBy a theorem of Descartes, this is equal to 4 divided by the number of vertices (i.e. the total defect at all vertices is 4).\nThe 3-dimensional analog of a plane angle is a solid angle. The solid angle, \"\u03a9\", at the vertex of a Platonic solid is given in terms of the dihedral angle by\nThis follows from the spherical excess formula for a spherical polygon and the fact that the vertex figure of the polyhedron {\"p\",\"q\"} is a regular \"q\"-gon.\nThe solid angle of a face subtended from the center of a platonic solid is equal to the solid angle of a full sphere (4 steradians) divided by the number of faces. Note that this is equal to the angular deficiency of its dual.\nThe various angles associated with the Platonic solids are tabulated below. The numerical values of the solid angles are given in steradians. The constant \"\u03c6\" = is the golden ratio.\nSection::::Geometric properties.:Radii, area, and volume.\nAnother virtue of regularity is that the Platonic solids all possess three concentric spheres:\nBULLET::::- the circumscribed sphere that passes through all the vertices,\nBULLET::::- the midsphere that is tangent to each edge at the midpoint of the edge, and\nBULLET::::- the inscribed sphere that is tangent to each face at the center of the face.\nThe radii of these spheres are called the \"circumradius\", the \"midradius\", and the \"inradius\". These are the distances from the center of the polyhedron to the vertices, edge midpoints, and face centers respectively. The circumradius \"R\" and the inradius \"r\" of the solid {\"p\", \"q\"} with edge length \"a\" are given by\nwhere \"\u03b8\" is the dihedral angle. The midradius \"\u03c1\" is given by\nwhere \"h\" is the quantity used above in the definition of the dihedral angle (\"h\" = 4, 6, 6, 10, or 10). Note that the ratio of the circumradius to the inradius is symmetric in \"p\" and \"q\":\nThe surface area, \"A\", of a Platonic solid {\"p\", \"q\"} is easily computed as area of a regular \"p\"-gon times the number of faces \"F\". This is:\nThe volume is computed as \"F\" times the volume of the pyramid whose base is a regular \"p\"-gon and whose height is the inradius \"r\". That is,\nThe following table lists the various radii of the Platonic solids together with their surface area and volume. The overall size is fixed by taking the edge length, \"a\", to be equal to 2.\nThe constants \"\u03c6\" and \"\u03be\" in the above are given by\nAmong the Platonic solids, either the dodecahedron or the icosahedron may be seen as the best approximation to the sphere. The icosahedron has the largest number of faces and the largest dihedral angle, it hugs its inscribed sphere the most tightly, and its surface area to volume ratio is closest to that of a sphere of the same size (i.e. either the same surface area or the same volume.) The dodecahedron, on the other hand, has the smallest angular defect, the largest vertex solid angle, and it fills out its circumscribed sphere the most.\nSection::::Symmetry.:Dual polyhedra.\nEvery polyhedron has a dual (or \"polar\") polyhedron with faces and vertices interchanged. The dual of every Platonic solid is another Platonic solid, so that we can arrange the five solids into dual pairs.\nBULLET::::- The tetrahedron is self-dual (i.e. its dual is another tetrahedron).\nBULLET::::- The cube and the octahedron form a dual pair.\nBULLET::::- The dodecahedron and the icosahedron form a dual pair.\nIf a polyhedron has Schl\u00e4fli symbol {\"p\", \"q\"}, then its dual has the symbol {\"q\", \"p\"}. Indeed, every combinatorial property of one Platonic solid can be interpreted as another combinatorial property of the dual.\nOne can construct the dual polyhedron by taking the vertices of the dual to be the centers of the faces of the original figure. Connecting the centers of adjacent faces in the original forms the edges of the dual and thereby interchanges the number of faces and vertices while maintaining the number of edges.\nMore generally, one can dualize a Platonic solid with respect to a sphere of radius \"d\" concentric with the solid. The radii (\"R\", \"\u03c1\", \"r\") of a solid and those of its dual (\"R\"*, \"\u03c1\"*, \"r\"*) are related by\nDualizing with respect to the midsphere (\"d\" = \"\u03c1\") is often convenient because the midsphere has the same relationship to both polyhedra. Taking \"d\" = \"Rr\" yields a dual solid with the same circumradius and inradius (i.e. \"R\"* = \"R\" and \"r\"* = \"r\").\nSection::::Symmetry.:Symmetry groups.\nIn mathematics, the concept of symmetry is studied with the notion of a mathematical group. Every polyhedron has an associated symmetry group, which is the set of all transformations (Euclidean isometries) which leave the polyhedron invariant. The order of the symmetry group is the number of symmetries of the polyhedron. One often distinguishes between the \"full symmetry group\", which includes reflections, and the \"proper symmetry group\", which includes only rotations.\nThe symmetry groups of the Platonic solids are a special class of three-dimensional point groups known as polyhedral groups. The high degree of symmetry of the Platonic solids can be interpreted in a number of ways. Most importantly, the vertices of each solid are all equivalent under the action of the symmetry group, as are the edges and faces. One says the action of the symmetry group is transitive on the vertices, edges, and faces. In fact, this is another way of defining regularity of a polyhedron: a polyhedron is \"regular\" if and only if it is vertex-uniform, edge-uniform, and face-uniform.\nThere are only three symmetry groups associated with the Platonic solids rather than five, since the symmetry group of any polyhedron coincides with that of its dual. This is easily seen by examining the construction of the dual polyhedron. Any symmetry of the original must be a symmetry of the dual and vice versa. The three polyhedral groups are:\nBULLET::::- the tetrahedral group \"T\",\nBULLET::::- the octahedral group \"O\" (which is also the symmetry group of the cube), and\nBULLET::::- the icosahedral group \"I\" (which is also the symmetry group of the dodecahedron).\nThe orders of the proper (rotation) groups are 12, 24, and"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-1847": 1, "wikipedia-29103307": 1, "wikipedia-23470": 1, "wikipedia-39781140": 1, "wikipedia-246092": 1, "wikipedia-23621": 1, "wikipedia-988191": 1, "wikipedia-23905": 1, "wikipedia-36803313": 1, "wikipedia-19762817": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-1847": 1, "wikipedia-29103307": 1, "wikipedia-23470": 2, "wikipedia-39781140": 2, "wikipedia-246092": 2, "wikipedia-23621": 2, "wikipedia-988191": 1, "wikipedia-23905": 2, "wikipedia-36803313": 1, "wikipedia-19762817": 1}}}

However, the specific content of the video would need to be cross-referenced for a complete answer.", "wikipedia-17669485": ["Systolic geometry is a branch of differential geometry, a field within mathematics, studying problems such as the relationship between the area inside a closed curve \"C\", and the length or perimeter of \"C\". Since the area \"A\" may be small while the length \"l\" is large, when \"C\" looks elongated, the relationship can only take the form of an inequality. What is more, such an inequality would be an upper bound for \"A\": there is no interesting lower bound just in terms of the length.\n\nThe solution to the isoperimetric problem in the plane is usually expressed in the form of an inequality that relates the length formula_1 of a closed curve and the area formula_2 of the planar region that it encloses. The isoperimetric inequality states that\nand that the equality holds if and only if the curve is a round circle. The inequality is an upper bound for area in terms of length.\n\nRecall the notion of central symmetry: a Euclidean polyhedron is called centrally symmetric if it is invariant under the antipodal map\nThus, in the plane central symmetry is the rotation by 180 degrees. For example, an ellipse is centrally symmetric, as is any ellipsoid in 3-space.\n\nAny centrally symmetric convex body of surface area formula_2 can be squeezed through a noose of length formula_6, with the tightest fit achieved by a sphere. This property is equivalent to a special case of Pu's inequality, one of the earliest systolic inequalities.\n\nThe \"systole\" of a compact metric space formula_13 is a metric\ninvariant of formula_13, defined to be the least length of a\nnoncontractible loop in formula_13. We will denote it as follows:\nNote that a loop minimizing length is necessarily a closed geodesic. When formula_13 is a graph, the invariant is usually referred to as the girth, ever since the 1947 article by William Tutte. Possibly inspired by Tutte's article, Charles Loewner started thinking about systolic questions on surfaces in the late 1940s, resulting in a 1950 thesis by his student P. M. Pu. The actual term \"systole\" itself was not coined until a quarter century later, by Marcel Berger."], "wikipedia-1775329": ["Basic topics in elementary mathematics include polygons, circles, perimeter and area.\nA polygon that is bounded by a finite chain of straight line segments closing in a loop to form a closed chain or \"circuit\". These segments are called its \"edges\" or \"sides\", and the points where two edges meet are the polygon's \"vertices\" (singular: vertex) or \"corners\". The interior of the polygon is sometimes called its \"body\". An \"n\"-gon is a polygon with \"n\" sides. A polygon is a 2-dimensional example of the more general polytope in any number of dimensions.\nA circle is a simple shape of two-dimensional geometry that is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the center.The distance between any of the points and the center is called the radius. It can also be defined as the locus of a point equidistant from a fixed point.\nA perimeter is a path that surrounds a two-dimensional shape. The term may be used either for the path or its length - it can be thought of as the length of the outline of a shape. The perimeter of a circle or ellipse is called its circumference.\nArea is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape. There are several well-known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as triangles, rectangles, and circles."], "wikipedia-23636": ["Perimeter\nA perimeter is a path that encompasses/surrounds a two-dimensional shape. The term may be used either for the path, or its length\u2014 in one dimension. It can be thought of as the length of the outline of a shape. The perimeter of a circle or ellipse is called its circumference. \nCalculating the perimeter has several practical applications. A calculated perimeter is the length of fence required to surround a yard or garden. The perimeter of a wheel/circle (its circumference) describes how far it will roll in one revolution. Similarly, the amount of string wound around a spool is related to the spool's perimeter; if the length of the string was exact, it would equal the perimeter.\nSection::::Formulas.\nThe perimeter is the distance around a shape. Perimeters for more general shapes can be calculated, as any path, with formula_1, where formula_2 is the length of the path and formula_3 is an infinitesimal line element. Both of these must be replaced with by algebraic forms in order to be practically calculated. If the perimeter is given as a closed piecewise smooth plane curve formula_4 with\nthen its length formula_2 can be computed as follows:\nA generalized notion of perimeter, which includes hypersurfaces bounding volumes in formula_8-dimensional Euclidean spaces, is described by the theory of Caccioppoli sets.\nSection::::Polygons.\nPolygons are fundamental to determining perimeters, not only because they are the simplest shapes but also because the perimeters of many shapes are calculated by approximating them with sequences of polygons tending to these shapes. The first mathematician known to have used this kind of reasoning is Archimedes, who approximated the perimeter of a circle by surrounding it with regular polygons.\nThe perimeter of a polygon equals the sum of the lengths of its sides (edges). In particular, the perimeter of a rectangle of width formula_9 and length formula_10 equals formula_11\nAn equilateral polygon is a polygon which has all sides of the same length (for example, a rhombus is a 4-sided equilateral polygon). To calculate the perimeter of an equilateral polygon, one must multiply the common length of the sides by the number of sides.\nA regular polygon may be characterized by the number of its sides and by its circumradius, that is to say, the constant distance between its centre and each of its vertices. The length of its sides can be calculated using trigonometry. If is a regular polygon's radius and is the number of its sides, then its perimeter is \nA splitter of a triangle is a cevian (a segment from a vertex to the opposite side) that divides the perimeter into two equal lengths, this common length being called the semiperimeter of the triangle. The three splitters of a triangle all intersect each other at the Nagel point of the triangle.\nA cleaver of a triangle is a segment from the midpoint of a side of a triangle to the opposite side such that the perimeter is divided into two equal lengths. The three cleavers of a triangle all intersect each other at the triangle's Spieker center.\nSection::::Circumference of a circle.\nThe perimeter of a circle, often called the circumference, is proportional to its diameter and its radius. That is to say, there exists a constant number pi, (the Greek \"p\" for perimeter), such that if is the circle's perimeter and its diameter then,\nIn terms of the radius of the circle, this formula becomes,\nTo calculate a circle's perimeter, knowledge of its radius or diameter and the number suffices. The problem is that is not rational (it cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers), nor is it algebraic (it is not a root of a polynomial equation with rational coefficients). So, obtaining an accurate approximation of is important in the calculation. The computation of the digits of is relevant to many fields, such as mathematical analysis, algorithmics and computer science.\nSection::::Perception of perimeter.\nThe perimeter and the area are two main measures of geometric figures. Confusing them is a common error, as well as believing that the greater one of them is, the greater the other must be. Indeed, a commonplace observation is that an enlargement (or a reduction) of a shape make its area grow (or decrease) as well as its perimeter. For example, if a field is drawn on a 1/ scale map, the actual field perimeter can be calculated multiplying the drawing perimeter by . The real area is times the area of the shape on the map. Nevertheless, there is no relation between the area and the perimeter of an ordinary shape. For example, the perimeter of a rectangle of width 0.001 and length 1000 is slightly above 2000, while the perimeter of a rectangle of width 0.5 and length 2 is 5. Both areas equal to 1.\nProclus (5th century) reported that Greek peasants \"fairly\" parted fields relying on their perimeters. However, a field's production is proportional to its area, not to its perimeter, so many naive peasants may have gotten fields with long perimeters but small areas (thus, few crops).\nIf one removes a piece from a figure, its area decreases but its perimeter may not. In the case of very irregular shapes, confusion between the perimeter and the convex hull may arise. The convex hull of a figure may be visualized as the shape formed by a rubber band stretched around it. In the animated picture on the left, all the figures have the same convex hull; the big, first hexagon.\nSection::::Isoperimetry.\nThe isoperimetric problem is to determine a figure with the largest area, amongst those having a given perimeter. The solution is intuitive; it is the circle. In particular, this can be used to explain why drops of fat on a broth surface are circular.\nThis problem may seem simple, but its mathematical proof requires some sophisticated theorems. The isoperimetric problem is sometimes simplified by restricting the type of figures to be used. In particular, to find the quadrilateral, or the triangle, or another particular figure, with the largest area amongst those with the same shape having a given perimeter. The solution to the quadrilateral isoperimetric problem is the square, and the solution to the triangle problem is the equilateral triangle. In general, the polygon with sides having the largest area and a given perimeter is the regular polygon, which is closer to being a circle than is any irregular polygon with the same number of sides.\nSection::::Etymology.\nThe word comes from the Greek \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \"perimetros\" from \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \"peri\" \"around\" and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \"metron\" \"measure\"."], "wikipedia-1209": ["Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).\nThe area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to squares of a fixed size. In the International System of Units (SI), the standard unit of area is the square metre (written as m), which is the area of a square whose sides are one metre long. A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares. In mathematics, the unit square is defined to have area one, and the area of any other shape or surface is a dimensionless real number.\nThere are several well-known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as triangles, rectangles, and circles. Using these formulas, the area of any polygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles. For shapes with curved boundary, calculus is usually required to compute the area. Indeed, the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the historical development of calculus.\nFor a solid shape such as a sphere, cone, or cylinder, the area of its boundary surface is called the surface area. Formulas for the surface areas of simple shapes were computed by the ancient Greeks, but computing the surface area of a more complicated shape usually requires multivariable calculus."], "wikipedia-11435202": ["A two-dimensional equable shape (or perfect shape) is one whose area is numerically equal to its perimeter. For example, a right angled triangle with sides 5, 12 and 13 has area and perimeter both have a unitless numerical value of 30.\n\nSection::::Scaling and units.\nAn area cannot be equal to a length except relative to a particular unit of measurement. For example, if shape has an area of 5 square yards and a perimeter of 5 yards, then it has an area of and a perimeter of 15 feet (since 3 feet = 1 yard and hence 9 square feet = 1 square yard). Moreover, contrary to what the name implies, changing the size while leaving the shape intact changes an \"equable shape\" into a non-equable shape. However its common use as GCSE coursework has led to its being an accepted concept. For any shape, there is a similar equable shape: if a shape \"S\" has perimeter \"p\" and area \"A\", then scaling \"S\" by a factor of \"p/A\" leads to an equable shape. Alternatively, one may find equable shapes by setting up and solving an equation in which the area equals the perimeter. In the case of the square, for instance, this equation is\nSolving this yields that \"x\" = 4, so a 4 \u00d7 4 square is equable.\n\nSection::::Tangential polygons.\nA tangential polygon is a polygon in which the sides are all tangent to a common circle. Every tangential polygon may be triangulated by drawing edges from the circle's center to the polygon's vertices, forming a collection of triangles that all have height equal to the circle's radius; it follows from this decomposition that the total area of a tangential polygon equals half the perimeter times the radius. Thus, a tangential polygon is equable if and only if its inradius is two. All triangles are tangential, so in particular the equable triangles are exactly the triangles with inradius two.\n\nSection::::Integer dimensions.\nCombining restrictions that a shape be equable and that its dimensions be integers is significantly more restrictive than either restriction on its own. For instance, there are infinitely many Pythagorean triples describing integer-sided right triangles, and there are infinitely many equable right triangles with non-integer sides; however, there are only two equable integer right triangles, with side lengths (5,12,13) and (6,8,10).\nMore generally, the problem of finding all equable triangles with integer sides (that is, equable Heronian triangles) was considered by B. Yates in 1858. As W. A. Whitworth and D. Biddle proved in 1904, there are exactly three solutions, beyond the right triangles already listed, with sides (6,25,29), (7,15,20), and (9,10,17).\nThe only equable rectangles with integer sides are the 4 \u00d7 4 square and the 3 \u00d7 6 rectangle. An integer rectangle is a special type of polyomino, and more generally there exist polyominoes with equal area and perimeter for any even integer area greater than or equal to 16. For smaller areas, the perimeter of a polyomino must exceed its area.\n\nSection::::Equable solids.\nIn three dimensions, a shape is equable when its surface area is numerically equal to its volume.\nAs with equable shapes in two dimensions, you may find an equable solid, in which the volume is numerically equal to the surface area, by scaling any solid by an appropriate factor. For example a cube with side length six."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-17669485": 1, "wikipedia-1775329": 2, "wikipedia-8907443": 1, "wikipedia-10913": 1, "wikipedia-5731861": 1, "wikipedia-14957244": 1, "wikipedia-23636": 1, "wikipedia-6473626": 1, "wikipedia-1209": 1, "wikipedia-11435202": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-17669485": 2, "wikipedia-1775329": 3, "wikipedia-8907443": 1, "wikipedia-10913": 1, "wikipedia-5731861": 1, "wikipedia-14957244": 1, "wikipedia-23636": 2, "wikipedia-6473626": 1, "wikipedia-1209": 2, "wikipedia-11435202": 2}}}

More complex polygons can be created out of multiple triangles, or as a single object with more than 3 vertices.

In the human brain, stereopsis results from complex mechanisms that form a three-dimensional impression by matching each point (or set of points) in one eye's view with the equivalent point (or set of points) in the other eye's view. Using binocular disparity, the brain derives the points' positions in the otherwise inscrutable \"z\"-axis (depth).\n\nWhen the brain is presented with a repeating pattern like wallpaper, it has difficulty matching the two eyes' views accurately. By looking at a horizontally repeating pattern, but converging the two eyes at a point behind the pattern, it is possible to trick the brain into matching one element of the pattern, as seen by the left eye, with another (similar looking) element, beside the first, as seen by the right eye. With the typical wall-eyed viewing, this gives the illusion of a plane bearing the same pattern but located behind the real wall. The distance at which this plane lies behind the wall depends only on the spacing between identical elements.\n\nAutostereograms use this dependence of depth on spacing to create three-dimensional images. If, over some area of the picture, the pattern is repeated at smaller distances, that area will appear closer than the background plane. If the distance of repeats is longer over some area, then that area will appear more distant (like a hole in the plane)."], "wikipedia-18567210": ["3D graphics, compared to 2D graphics, are graphics that use a three-dimensional representation of geometric data.

The simplest mathematical realization is a lattice or a random geometric graph, where nodes are distributed uniformly at random over a two-dimensional plane; a pair of nodes are connected if the Euclidean distance is smaller than a given neighborhood radius. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks and neural networks are all examples where the underlying space is relevant and where the graph's topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure, resilience and the evolution of spatial networks is crucial for many different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology.\n\nSection::::Characterizing spatial networks.\nThe following aspects are some of the characteristics to examine a spatial network:\nBULLET::::- Planar networks\nIn many applications, such as rail, roads, and other transportation networks the network is assumed to be planar. Planar networks build up an important group out of the spatial networks, but not all spatial networks are planar. Indeed, the airline passenger\nnetworks is a non-planar example: All airports in the world are connected through direct flights. \nBULLET::::- The way it is embedded in space\nThere are examples of networks, which seem to be not \"directly\" embedded in space. Social networks for instance\nconnect individuals through friendship relations. But in this case, space intervenes in the fact that the connection\nprobability between two individuals usually decreases with the distance between them.\nBULLET::::- Voronoi tessellation\nA spatial network can be represented by a Voronoi diagram, which is a way of dividing space into a number of regions. The dual graph for a Voronoi diagram corresponds to the Delaunay triangulation for the same set of points.\nVoronoi tessellations are interesting for spatial networks in the sense that they provide a natural representation model\nto which one can compare a real world network.\nBULLET::::- Mixing space and topology\nExamining the topology of the nodes and edges itself is another way to characterize networks. The distribution of degree of the nodes is often considered, regarding the structure of edges it is useful to find the Minimum spanning tree, or the generalization, the Steiner tree and the relative neighborhood graph.\n\nSection::::Lattice networks.\nLattice networks (see Fig. 1) are useful models for spatial embedded networks. Many physical phenomenas have been studied on these structures. Examples include Ising model for spontaneous magnetization, diffusion phenomena modeled as random walks\nand percolation. Recently to model the resilience of interdependent infrastructures which are spatially embedded a model of interdependent lattice networks was introduced (see Fig. 2) and analyzed\n. A spatial multiplex model was introduced\nby Danziger et al and was analyzed further by Vaknin et al. For the model see Fig. 3.\n\nSection::::Approach from the theory of space syntax.\nAnother definition of spatial network derives from the theory of space syntax. It can be notoriously difficult to decide what a spatial element should be in complex spaces involving large open areas or many interconnected paths. The originators of space syntax, Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson use axial lines and convex spaces as the spatial elements. Loosely, an axial line is the 'longest line of sight and access' through open space, and a convex space the 'maximal convex polygon' that can be drawn in open space. Each of these elements is defined by the geometry of the local boundary in different regions of the space map. Decomposition of a space map into a complete set of intersecting axial lines or overlapping convex spaces produces the axial map or overlapping convex map respectively. Algorithmic definitions of these maps exist, and this allows the mapping from an arbitrary shaped space map to a network amenable to graph mathematics to be carried out in a relatively well defined manner. Axial maps are used to analyse urban networks, where the system generally comprises linear segments, whereas convex maps are more often used to analyse building plans where space patterns are often more convexly articulated, however both convex and axial maps may be used in either situation."], "wikipedia-318648": ["The Music of the Spheres incorporates the metaphysical principle that mathematical relationships express qualities or \"tones\" of energy which manifest in numbers, visual angles, shapes and sounds \u2013 all connected within a pattern of proportion. Pythagoras first identified that the pitch of a musical note is in inverse proportion to the length of the string that produces it, and that intervals between harmonious sound frequencies form simple numerical ratios. In a theory known as the Harmony of the Spheres, Pythagoras proposed that the Sun, Moon and planets all emit their own unique hum based on their orbital revolution, and that the quality of life on Earth reflects the tenor of celestial sounds which are physically imperceptible to the human ear. Subsequently, Plato described astronomy and music as \"twinned\" studies of sensual recognition: astronomy for the eyes, music for the ears, and both requiring knowledge of numerical proportions.\n\n\"Harmonices\" is split into five books, or chapters. The first and second books give a brief discussion on regular polyhedron and their congruences, reiterating the idea he introduced in \"Mysterium\" that the five regular solids known about since antiquity define the orbits of the planets and their distances from the sun. Book three focuses on defining musical harmonies, including consonance and dissonance, intervals (including the problems of just tuning), their relations to string length, and what makes music pleasurable to listen to. In the fourth book Kepler presents a metaphysical basis for this system, along with arguments for why the harmony of the worlds appeals to the intellectual soul in the same manner as the harmony of music appeals to the human soul. Here he also uses the naturalness of this harmony as an argument for heliocentrism. In book five, Kepler describes in detail the orbital motion of the planets and how this motion nearly perfectly matches musical harmonies. Finally, after a discussion on astrology in book five, Kepler ends \"Harmonices\" by describing his third law, which states that for any planet the cube of the semi-major axis of its elliptical orbit is proportional to the square of its orbital period.\n\nIn the final book of \"Harmonices\", Kepler explains how the ratio of the maximum and minimum angular speeds of each planet (its speeds at the perihelion and aphelion) is very nearly equivalent to a consonant musical interval. Furthermore, the ratios between these extreme speeds of the planets compared against each other create even more mathematical harmonies. These speeds explain the eccentricity of the orbits of the planets in a natural way that appealed to Kepler\u2019s religious beliefs in a heavenly creator.\n\nHe makes an analogy between comparing the extreme speeds of one planet and the extreme speeds of multiple planets with the difference between monophonic and polyphonic music. Because planets with larger eccentricities have a greater variation in speed they produce more \u201cnotes.\u201d Earth\u2019s maximum and minimum speeds, for example, are in a ratio of roughly 16 to 15, or that of a semitone, whereas Venus\u2019 orbit is nearly circular, and therefore only produces a singular note. Mercury, which has the largest eccentricity, has the largest interval, a minor tenth, or a ratio of 12 to 5. This range, as well as the relative speeds between the planets, led Kepler to conclude that the Solar System was composed of two basses (Saturn and Jupiter), a tenor (Mars), two altos (Venus and Earth), and a soprano (Mercury), which had sung in \u201cperfect concord,\u201d at the beginning of time, and could potentially arrange themselves to do so again."], "wikipedia-27667": ["Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is conceived as \"curved\", rather than \"flat\". According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space. Experimental tests of general relativity have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.\n\nEuclid's \"Elements\" contained five postulates that form the basis for Euclidean geometry. One of these, the parallel postulate, has been the subject of debate among mathematicians for many centuries. It states that on any plane on which there is a straight line \"L\" and a point \"P\" not on \"L\", there is exactly one straight line \"L\" on the plane that passes through the point \"P\" and is parallel to the straight line \"L\". Until the 19th century, few doubted the truth of the postulate; instead debate centered over whether it was necessary as an axiom, or whether it was a theory that could be derived from the other axioms. Around 1830 though, the Hungarian J\u00e1nos Bolyai and the Russian Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky separately published treatises on a type of geometry that does not include the parallel postulate, called hyperbolic geometry. In this geometry, an infinite number of parallel lines pass through the point \"P\". Consequently, the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180\u00b0 and the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is greater than pi. In the 1850s, Bernhard Riemann developed an equivalent theory of elliptical geometry, in which no parallel lines pass through \"P\". In this geometry, triangles have more than 180\u00b0 and circles have a ratio of circumference-to-diameter that"], "wikipedia-5731861": ["The five van Hiele levels are sometimes misunderstood to be descriptions of how students understand shape classification, but the levels actually describe the way that students reason about shapes and other geometric ideas. Pierre van Hiele noticed that his students tended to \"plateau\" at certain points in their understanding of geometry and he identified these plateau points as \"levels\". In general, these levels are a product of experience and instruction rather than age. This is in contrast to Piaget's theory of cognitive development, which is age-dependent. A child must have enough experiences (classroom or otherwise) with these geometric ideas to move to a higher level of sophistication. Through rich experiences, children can reach Level 2 in elementary school. Without such experiences, many adults (including teachers) remain in Level 1 all their lives, even if they take a formal geometry course in secondary school. The levels are as follows:\nLevel 0. Visualization: At this level, the focus of a child's thinking is on individual shapes, which the child is learning to classify by judging their holistic appearance. Children simply say, \"That is a circle,\" usually without further description. Children identify prototypes of basic geometrical figures (triangle, circle, square). These visual prototypes are then used to identify other shapes. A shape is a circle because it looks like a sun; a shape is a rectangle because it looks like a door or a box; and so on. A square seems to be a different sort of shape than a rectangle, and a rhombus does not look like other parallelograms, so these shapes are classified completely separately in the child\u2019s mind. Children view figures holistically without analyzing their properties. If a shape does not sufficiently resemble its prototype, the child may reject the classification. Thus, children at this stage might balk at calling a thin, wedge-shaped triangle (with sides 1, 20, 20 or sides 20, 20, 39) a \"triangle\", because it's so different in shape from an equilateral triangle, which is the usual prototype for \"triangle\". If the horizontal base of the triangle is on top and the opposing vertex below, the child may recognize it as a triangle, but claim it is \"upside down\". Shapes with rounded or incomplete sides may be accepted as \"triangles\" if they bear a holistic resemblance to an equilateral triangle. Squares are called \"diamonds\" and not recognized as squares if their sides are oriented at 45\u00b0 to the horizontal. Children at this level often believe something is true based on a single example.\nLevel 1. Analysis: At this level, the shapes become bearers of their properties. The objects of thought are classes of shapes, which the child has learned to analyze as having properties. A person at this level might say, \"A square has 4 equal sides and 4 equal angles. Its diagonals are congruent and perpendicular, and they bisect each other.\" The properties are more important than the appearance of the shape. If a figure is sketched on the blackboard and the teacher claims it is intended to have congruent sides and angles, the students accept that it is a square, even if it is poorly drawn. Properties are not yet ordered at this level. Children can discuss the properties of the basic figures and recognize them by these properties, but generally do not allow categories to overlap because they understand each property in isolation from the others. For example, they will still insist that \"a square is not a rectangle.\" (They may introduce extraneous properties to support such beliefs, such as defining a rectangle as a shape with one pair of sides longer than the other pair of sides.) Children begin to notice many properties of shapes, but do not see the relationships between the properties; therefore they cannot reduce the list of properties to a concise definition with necessary and sufficient conditions. They usually reason inductively from several examples, but cannot yet reason deductively because they do not understand how the properties of shapes are related.\nLevel 2. Abstraction: At this level, properties are ordered. The objects of thought are geometric properties, which the student has learned to connect deductively. The student understands that properties are related and one set of properties may imply another property. Students can reason with simple arguments about geometric figures. A student at this level might say, \"Isosceles triangles are symmetric, so their base angles must be equal.\" Learners recognize the relationships between types of shapes. They recognize that all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares, and they understand why squares are a type of rectangle based on an understanding of the properties of each. They can tell whether it is possible or not to have a rectangle that is, for example, also a rhombus. They understand necessary and sufficient conditions and can write concise definitions. However, they do not yet understand the intrinsic meaning of deduction. They cannot follow a complex argument, understand the place of definitions, or grasp the need for axioms, so they cannot yet understand the role of formal geometric proofs.\nLevel 3. Deduction: Students at this level understand the meaning of deduction. The object of thought is deductive reasoning (simple proofs), which the student learns to combine to form a system of formal proofs (Euclidean geometry). Learners can construct geometric proofs at a secondary school level and understand their meaning. They understand the role of undefined terms, definitions, axioms and theorems in Euclidean geometry. However, students at this level believe that axioms and definitions are fixed, rather than arbitrary, so they cannot yet conceive of non-Euclidean geometry. Geometric ideas are still understood as objects in the Euclidean plane.\nLevel 4. Rigor: At this level, geometry is understood at the level of a mathematician. Students understand that definitions are arbitrary and need not actually refer to any concrete realization. The object of thought is deductive geometric systems, for which the learner compares axiomatic systems. Learners can study non-Euclidean geometries with understanding. People can understand the discipline of geometry and how it differs philosophically from non-mathematical studies."], "wikipedia-31584301": ["A geometric network is an object commonly used in geographic information systems to model a series of interconnected features. A geometric network is similar to a graph in mathematics and computer science, and can be described and analyzed using theories and concepts similar to graph theory. Geometric networks are often used to model road networks and public utility networks (such as electric, gas, and water utilities).\nSection::::Composition of a Geometric Network.\nA geometric network is composed of edges that are connected. Connectivity rules for the network specify which edges are connected and at what points they are connected, commonly referred to as junction or intersection points. These edges can have weights or flow direction assigned to them, which dictate certain properties of these edges that affect analysis results\n. In the case of certain types of networks, source points (points where flow originates) and sink points (points where flow terminates) may also exist. In the case of utility networks, a source point may correlate with an electric substation or a water pumping station, and a sink point may correlate with a service connection at a residential household.\nSection::::Functions.\nNetworks define the interconnectedness of features. Through analyzing this connectivity, paths from one point to another on the network can be traced and calculated. Through optimization algorithms and utilizing network weights and flow, these paths can also be optimized to show specialized paths, such as the shortest path between two points on the network, as is commonly done in the calculation of driving directions. Networks can also be used to perform spatial analysis to determine points or edges that are encompassed in a certain area or within a certain distance of a specified point.

For example, the configuration space of a rigid body such as a satellite is the group of Euclidean motions (translations and rotations in space), while the configuration space for a liquid crystal is the group of diffeomorphisms coupled with an internal state (gauge symmetry or order parameter).\nSection::::Momentum map and reduction.\nOne of the principal ideas of geometric mechanics is \"reduction\", which goes back to Jacobi's elimination of the node in the 3-body problem, but in its modern form is due to K. Meyer (1973) and independently J.E. Marsden and A. Weinstein (1974), both inspired by the work of Smale (1970). Symmetry of a Hamiltonian or Lagrangian system gives rise to conserved quantities, by Noether's theorem, and these conserved quantities are the components of the momentum map J. If \"P\" is the phase space and \"G\" the symmetry group, the momentum map is a map formula_1, and the reduced spaces are quotients of the level sets of J by the subgroup of \"G\" preserving the level set in question: for formula_2 one defines formula_3, and this reduced space is a symplectic manifold if formula_4 is a regular value of \"J\".\nSection::::Variational principles.\nBULLET::::- Euler\u2013Lagrange\nBULLET::::- D'Alembert\nBULLET::::- Maupertuis\nBULLET::::- Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9\nBULLET::::- Vakonomic\nSection::::Geometric integrators.\nOne of the important developments arising from the geometric approach to mechanics is the incorporation of the geometry into numerical methods.\nIn particular symplectic and variational integrators are proving particularly accurate for long-term integration of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian systems."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-60062825": 1, "wikipedia-1708671": 1, "wikipedia-39309668": 1, "wikipedia-318648": 1, "wikipedia-27667": 1, "wikipedia-5731861": 1, "wikipedia-4222874": 1, "wikipedia-55690563": 1, "wikipedia-31584301": 1, "wikipedia-41499924": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-60062825": 1, "wikipedia-1708671": 2, "wikipedia-39309668": 1, "wikipedia-318648": 2, "wikipedia-27667": 2, "wikipedia-5731861": 2, "wikipedia-4222874": 1, "wikipedia-55690563": 1, "wikipedia-31584301": 2, "wikipedia-41499924": 2}}}

The depiction of animals and people is generally discouraged, which explains the preference for abstract geometric patterns.\n\nThere are two modes to arabesque art. The first recalls the principles that govern the order of the world. These principles include the bare basics of what makes objects structurally sound and, by extension, beautiful (i.e. the angle and the fixed/static shapes that it creates\u2014esp. the truss). In the first mode, each repeating geometric form has a built-in symbolism ascribed to it. For example, the square, with its four equilateral sides, is symbolic of the equally important elements of nature: earth, air, fire and water. Without any one of the four, the physical world, represented by a circle that inscribes the square, would collapse upon itself and cease to exist. The second mode is based upon the flowing nature of plant forms. This mode recalls the feminine nature of life giving. In addition, upon inspection of the many examples of Arabesque art, some would argue that there is in fact a third mode, the mode of Islamic calligraphy.\n\nInstead of recalling something related to the 'True Reality' (the reality of the spiritual world), Islam considers calligraphy a visible expression of the highest art of all; the art of the spoken word (the transmittal of thoughts and of history). In Islam, the most important document to be transmitted orally is the Qur'an. Proverbs and complete passages from the Qur'an can be seen today in Arabesque art. The coming together of these three forms creates the Arabesque, and this is a reflection of unity arising from diversity; a basic tenet of Islam.\n\nThe arabesque may be equally thought of as both art and science. The artwork is at the same time mathematically precise, aesthetically pleasing, and symbolic. Due to this duality of creation, the artistic part of this equation may be further subdivided into both secular and religious artwork. However, for many Muslims there is no distinction; all forms of art, the natural world, mathematics and science are seen to be creations of God and therefore reflections of the same thing: God's will expressed through his creation.

Relatives of the deceased conducted burial rituals that included three parts: the \"prothesis\" \"(laying out of the body), the \"ekphora\" (funeral procession), and the interment of the body or cremated remains of the body.\n\nTo the Greeks, an omission of a proper burial was an insult to proper dignity. The mythological context of a proper burial relates to the Greeks' belief in a continued existence in the underworld that will disallow the dead to maintain peace in the absence of a proper burial ritual.\n\nAside from its funerary use, the Greeks also utilized various vessels during symposiums. The Greek symposium was a social gathering that only aristocratic males were allowed to attend. Vessels, such as wine coolers, jugs, various drinking cups, and mixing vessels, were decorated with Greek, geometric scenes. Some of the scenes depicted drinking parties or Dionysus and his followers. The symposia would be held in the \u201candron,\u201d which was a man\u2019s only room.

The concept applies also to sacred spaces such as temenoi, sacred groves, village greens, and holy wells, and the creation of religious art."], "wikipedia-36915": ["The arabesques and geometric patterns of Islamic art are often said to arise from the Islamic view of the world (see above). The depiction of animals and people is generally discouraged, which explains the preference for abstract geometric patterns.\n\nThere are two modes to arabesque art. The first recalls the principles that govern the order of the world. These principles include the bare basics of what makes objects structurally sound and, by extension, beautiful (i.e. the angle and the fixed/static shapes that it creates\u2014esp. the truss). In the first mode, each repeating geometric form has a built-in symbolism ascribed to it. For example, the square, with its four equilateral sides, is symbolic of the equally important elements of nature: earth, air, fire and water. Without any one of the four, the physical world, represented by a circle that inscribes the square, would collapse upon itself and cease to exist. The second mode is based upon the flowing nature of plant forms. This mode recalls the feminine nature of life giving. In addition, upon inspection of the many examples of Arabesque art, some would argue that there is in fact a third mode, the mode of Islamic calligraphy.\n\nInstead of recalling something related to the 'True Reality' (the reality of the spiritual world), Islam considers calligraphy a visible expression of the highest art of all; the art of the spoken word (the transmittal of thoughts and of history). In Islam, the most important document to be transmitted orally is the Qur'an. Proverbs and complete passages from the Qur'an can be seen today in Arabesque art. The coming together of these three forms creates the Arabesque, and this is a reflection of unity arising from diversity; a basic tenet of Islam.\n\nThe arabesque may be equally thought of as both art and science. The artwork is at the same time mathematically precise, aesthetically pleasing, and symbolic. Due to this duality of creation, the artistic part of this equation may be further subdivided into both secular and religious artwork. However, for many Muslims there is no distinction; all forms of art, the natural world, mathematics and science are seen to be creations of God and therefore reflections of the same thing: God's will expressed through his creation. In other words, man can discover the geometric forms that constitute the arabesque, but these forms always existed before as part of God's creation, as shown in this picture.\n\nThere is great similarity between arabesque artwork from very different geographic regions. In fact, the similarities are so pronounced that it is sometimes difficult for experts to tell where a given style of arabesque comes from. The reason for this is that the science and mathematics that are used to construct Arabesque artwork are universal. Therefore, for most Muslims, the best artwork that can be created by man for use in the Mosque is artwork that displays the underlying order and unity of nature.

These are named after Jean-Robert Argand (1768\u20131822), although they were first described by Norwegian-Danish land surveyor and mathematician Caspar Wessel (1745\u20131818). Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the positions of the poles and zeroes of a function in the complex plane.\nThe concept of the complex plane allows a geometric interpretation of complex numbers. Under addition, they add like vectors. The multiplication of two complex numbers can be expressed most easily in polar coordinates \u2014 the magnitude or \"modulus\" of the product is the product of the two absolute values, or moduli, and the angle or \"argument\" of the product is the sum of the two angles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 acts as a rotation.\nSection::::Specific types of mathematical diagrams.:Butterfly diagram.\nIn the context of fast Fourier transform algorithms, a butterfly is a portion of the computation that combines the results of smaller discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) into a larger DFT, or vice versa (breaking a larger DFT up into subtransforms).

The same structure can also be found in the Viterbi algorithm, used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states.\nThe butterfly diagram show a data-flow diagram connecting the inputs \"x\" (left) to the outputs \"y\" that depend on them (right) for a \"butterfly\" step of a radix-2 Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm. This diagram resembles a butterfly as in the morpho butterfly shown for comparison), hence the name.\nSection::::Specific types of mathematical diagrams.:Commutative diagram.\nIn mathematics, and especially in category theory, a commutative diagram is a diagram of objects, also known as vertices, and morphisms, also known as arrows or edges, such that when selecting two objects any directed path through the diagram leads to the same result by composition.\nCommutative diagrams play the role in category theory that equations play in algebra.\nSection::::Specific types of mathematical diagrams.:Hasse diagrams.\nA Hasse diagram is a simple picture of a finite partially ordered set, forming a drawing of the partial order's transitive reduction. Concretely, one represents each element of the set as a vertex on the page and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from \"x\" to \"y\" precisely when \"x\" < \"y\" and there is no \"z\" such that \"x\" < \"z\" < \"y\". In this case, we say y covers x, or y is an immediate successor of x. In a Hasse diagram, it is required that the curves be drawn so that each meets exactly two vertices: its two endpoints. Any such diagram (given that the vertices are labeled) uniquely determines a partial order, and any partial order has a unique transitive reduction, but there are many possible placements of elements in the plane, resulting in different Hasse diagrams for a given order that may have widely varying appearances.\nSection::::Specific types of mathematical diagrams.:Knot diagrams.\nIn Knot theory a useful way to visualise and manipulate knots is to project the knot onto a plane\u2014;think of the knot casting a shadow on the wall. A small perturbation in the choice of projection will ensure that it is one-to-one except at the double points, called \"crossings\", where the \"shadow\" of the knot crosses itself once transversely\nAt each crossing we must indicate which section is \"over\" and which is \"under\", so as to be able to recreate the original knot. This is often done by creating a break in the strand going underneath. If by following the diagram the knot alternately crosses itself \"over\" and \"under\", then the diagram represents a particularly well-studied class of knot, alternating knots.\nSection::::Specific types of mathematical diagrams.:Venn diagram.\nA Venn diagram is a representation of mathematical sets: a mathematical diagram representing sets as circles, with their relationships to each other expressed through their overlapping positions, so that all possible relationships between the sets are shown.\nThe Venn diagram is constructed with a collection of simple closed curves drawn in the plane. The principle of these diagrams is that classes be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is not null.\nSection::::Specific types of mathematical diagrams.:Voronoi diagram.\nA Voronoi diagram is a special kind of decomposition of a metric space determined by distances to a specified discrete set of objects in the space, e.g., by a discrete set of points. This diagram is named after Georgy Voronoi, also called a Voronoi tessellation, a Voronoi decomposition, or a Dirichlet tessellation after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.\nIn the simplest case, we are given a set of points S in the plane, which are the Voronoi sites. Each site s has a Voronoi cell V(s) consisting of all points closer to s than to any other site. The segments of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to two sites. The Voronoi nodes are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites\nSection::::Specific types of mathematical diagrams.:Wallpaper group diagrams.\nA wallpaper group or \"plane symmetry group\" or \"plane crystallographic group\" is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern, based on the symmetries in the pattern. Such patterns occur frequently in architecture and decorative art. There are 17 possible distinct groups.\nWallpaper groups are two-dimensional symmetry groups, intermediate in complexity between the simpler frieze groups and the three-dimensional crystallographic groups, also called space groups. Wallpaper groups categorize patterns by their symmetries. Subtle differences may place similar patterns in different groups, while patterns which are very different in style, color, scale or orientation may belong to the same group.\nSection::::Specific types of mathematical diagrams.:Young diagram.\nA \"Young diagram\" or Young tableau, also called Ferrers diagram, is a finite collection of boxes, or cells, arranged in left-justified rows, with the row sizes weakly decreasing (each row has the same or shorter length than its predecessor). \nListing the number of boxes in each row gives a partition formula_1 of a positive integer \"n\", the total number of boxes of the diagram. The Young diagram is said to be of shape formula_1, and it carries the same information as that partition. Listing the number of boxes in each column gives another partition, the conjugate or \"transpose\" partition of formula_1; one obtains a Young diagram of that shape by reflecting the original diagram along its main diagonal.\nYoung tableaux were introduced by Alfred Young, a mathematician at Cambridge University, in 1900. They were then applied to the study of symmetric group by Georg Frobenius in 1903.

It depicts the objects and classes involved in the scenario and the sequence of messages exchanged between the objects needed to carry out the functionality of the scenario. Sequence diagrams are typically associated with use case realizations in the Logical View of the system under development. Sequence diagrams are sometimes called event diagrams or event scenarios.\nA sequence diagram shows, as parallel vertical lines (\"lifelines\"), different processes or objects that live simultaneously, and, as horizontal arrows, the messages exchanged between them, in the order in which they occur. This allows the specification of simple runtime scenarios in a graphical manner.\nSection::::Diagram building blocks.\nIf the lifeline is that of an object, it demonstrates a role. Leaving the instance name blank can represent anonymous and unnamed instances.\nMessages, written with horizontal arrows with the message name written above them, display interaction. Solid arrow heads represent synchronous calls, open arrow heads represent asynchronous messages, and dashed lines represent reply messages.\nIf a caller sends a synchronous message, it must wait until the message is done, such as invoking a subroutine. If a caller sends an asynchronous message, it can continue processing and doesn\u2019t have to wait for a response. Asynchronous calls are present in multithreaded applications, event-driven applications and in message-oriented middleware. \nActivation boxes, or method-call boxes, are opaque rectangles drawn on top of lifelines to represent that processes are being performed in response to the message (ExecutionSpecifications in UML).\nObjects calling methods on themselves use messages and add new activation boxes on top of any others to indicate a further level of processing. If an object is destroyed (removed from memory), an X is drawn on bottom of the lifeline, and the dashed line ceases to be drawn below it. It should be the result of a message, either from the object itself, or another.\nA message sent from outside the diagram can be represented by a message originating from a filled-in circle (\"found message\" in UML) or from a border of the sequence diagram (\"gate\" in UML).\nUML has introduced significant improvements to the capabilities of sequence diagrams. Most of these improvements are based on the idea of \"interaction fragments\" which represent smaller pieces of an enclosing interaction. Multiple interaction fragments are combined to create a variety of \"combined fragments\", which are then used to model interactions that include parallelism, conditional branches, optional interactions."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-6192696": 1, "wikipedia-44564": 1, "wikipedia-35248": 1, "wikipedia-19266946": 1, "wikipedia-3272347": 1, "wikipedia-1810137": 1, "wikipedia-43072303": 1, "wikipedia-60628425": 1, "wikipedia-46754": 1, "wikipedia-31152898": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-6192696": 2, "wikipedia-44564": 1, "wikipedia-35248": 1, "wikipedia-19266946": 2, "wikipedia-3272347": 2, "wikipedia-1810137": 2, "wikipedia-43072303": 1, "wikipedia-60628425": 1, "wikipedia-46754": 1, "wikipedia-31152898": 1}}}

It is also called a tetraplex (abbreviated from \"tetrahedral complex\") and polytetrahedron, being bounded by tetrahedral cells.\nIts boundary is composed of 600 tetrahedral cells with 20 meeting at each vertex. Together they form 1200 triangular faces, 720 edges, and 120 vertices. The edges form 72 flat regular decagons. Each vertex of the 600-cell is a vertex of six such decagons.\nThe mutual distances of the vertices, measured in degrees of arc on the circumscribed hypersphere, only have the values 36\u00b0 = , 60\u00b0 = , 72\u00b0 = , 90\u00b0 = , 108\u00b0 = , 120\u00b0 = , 144\u00b0 = , and 180\u00b0 = .

These can be seen in the H3 Coxeter plane projections with overlapping vertices colored. Just like the icosidodecahedron can be partitioned into 6 central decagons (60 edge = 6\u00d710), the 600-cell can be partitioned into 72 decagons (720 edges = 72 \u00d7 10).\nWhen interpreted as quaternions, the 120 vertices of the 600-cell form a group under quaternionic multiplication.

It occurs twice in the rotational symmetry group \"RSG\" of the 600-cell as an invariant subgroup, namely as the subgroup \"2I\" of quaternion left-multiplications and as the subgroup \"2I\" of quaternion right-multiplications. Each rotational symmetry of the 600-cell is generated by specific elements of \"2I\" and \"2I\"; the pair of opposite elements generate the same element of \"RSG\". The centre of \"RSG\" consists of the non-rotation \"Id\" and the central inversion \"\u2212Id\". We have the isomorphism \"RSG \u2245 (2I \u00d7 2I) / {Id, -Id}\".

It was first described in 1638 by Galileo Galilei in his \"Two New Sciences\" as the \"...ratio of two volumes is greater than the ratio of their surfaces\". This principle states that, as a shape grows in size, its volume grows faster than its surface area. When applied to the real world this principle has many implications which are important in fields ranging from mechanical engineering to biomechanics. It helps explain phenomena including why large mammals like elephants have a harder time cooling themselves than small ones like mice, and why building taller and taller skyscrapers is increasingly difficult.\nFor example, a cube with a side length of 1 meter has a surface area of 6 m and a volume of 1 m. If the dimensions of the cube were multiplied by 2, its surface area would be multiplied by the \"square\" of 2 and become 24 m. Its volume would be multiplied by the \"cube\" of 2 and become 8 m. \nThe original cube (1m sides) has a surface area to volume ratio of 6:1. The larger (2m sides) cube has a surface area to volume ratio of (24/8) 3:1. As the dimensions increase, the volume will continue to grow faster than the surface area. Thus the square\u2013cube law. This principle applies to all solids.\nIf an animal were isometrically scaled up by a considerable amount, its relative muscular strength would be severely reduced, since the cross section of its muscles would increase by the \"square\" of the scaling factor while its mass would increase by the \"cube\" of the scaling factor. As a result of this, cardiovascular and respiratory functions would be severely burdened."], "wikipedia-7282499": ["The surface-area-to-volume ratio, also called the surface-to-volume ratio and variously denoted sa/vol or SA:V, is the amount of surface area per unit volume of an object or collection of objects.\nIn chemical reactions involving a solid material, the surface area to volume ratio is an important factor for the reactivity, that is, the rate at which the chemical reaction will proceed.\nFor a given volume, the object with the smallest surface area (and therefore with the smallest SA:V) is the sphere, a consequence of the isoperimetric inequality in 3 dimensions. By contrast, objects with tiny spikes will have very large surface area for a given volume.\nMaterials with high surface area to volume ratio (e.g. very small diameter, very porous, or otherwise not compact) react at much faster rates than monolithic materials, because more surface is available to react. Examples include grain dust; while grain isn't typically flammable, grain dust is explosive. Finely ground salt dissolves much more quickly than coarse salt.\nHigh surface area to volume ratio provides a strong \"driving force\" to speed up thermodynamic processes that minimize free energy.\nThe ratio between the surface area and volume of cells and organisms has an enormous impact on their biology, including their physiology and behavior. For example, many aquatic microorganisms have increased surface area to increase their drag in the water. This reduces their rate of sink and allows them to remain near the surface with less energy expenditure.\nAn increased surface area to volume ratio also means increased exposure to the environment. The finely-branched appendages of filter feeders such as krill provide a large surface area to sift the water for food.\nIndividual organs like the lung have numerous internal branchings that increase the surface area; in the case of the lung, the large surface supports gas exchange, bringing oxygen into the blood and releasing carbon dioxide from the blood. Similarly, the small intestine has a finely wrinkled internal surface, allowing the body to absorb nutrients efficiently.\nCells can achieve a high surface area to volume ratio with an elaborately convoluted surface, like the microvilli lining the small intestine.\nIncreased surface area can also lead to biological problems. More contact with the environment through the surface of a cell or an organ (relative to its volume) increases loss of water and dissolved substances. High surface area to volume ratios also present problems of temperature control in unfavorable environments.\nIn the context of wildfires, the ratio of the surface area of a solid fuel to its volume is an important measurement. Fire spread behavior is frequently correlated to the surface-area-to-volume ratio of the fuel (e.g. leaves and branches). The higher its value, the faster a particle responds to changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature or moisture.

Many sophisticated methods can estimate the characteristics of surfaces from a limited number of point measurements. Additionally, from a series of three-dimensional points, or digital elevation model, isopleth lines representing elevation contours can be generated, along with slope analysis, shaded relief, and other elevation products. Terrain analysis is fundamental to hydrology, since water always flows down a slope.

While the query is abstract (\"apply here\"), Wikipedia's content can provide foundational knowledge to address it partially.", "wikipedia-1730659": ["The square\u2013cube law (or cube\u2013square law) is a mathematical principle, applied in a variety of scientific fields, which describes the relationship between the volume and the surface area as a shape's size increases or decreases. It was first described in 1638 by Galileo Galilei in his \"Two New Sciences\" as the \"...ratio of two volumes is greater than the ratio of their surfaces\".\nThis principle states that, as a shape grows in size, its volume grows faster than its surface area. When applied to the real world this principle has many implications which are important in fields ranging from mechanical engineering to biomechanics. It helps explain phenomena including why large mammals like elephants have a harder time cooling themselves than small ones like mice, and why building taller and taller skyscrapers is increasingly difficult.\nSection::::Description.\nThe square\u2013cube law can be stated as follows:\nRepresented mathematically:\nwhere formula_2 is the original surface area and formula_3 is the new surface area.\nwhere formula_5 is the original volume, formula_6 is the new volume, formula_7 is the original length and formula_8 is the new length.\nFor example, a cube with a side length of 1 meter has a surface area of 6 m and a volume of 1 m. If the dimensions of the cube were multiplied by 2, its surface area would be multiplied by the \"square\" of 2 and become 24 m. Its volume would be multiplied by the \"cube\" of 2 and become 8 m. \nThe original cube (1m sides) has a surface area to volume ratio of 6:1. The larger (2m sides) cube has a surface area to volume ratio of (24/8) 3:1. As the dimensions increase, the volume will continue to grow faster than the surface area. Thus the square\u2013cube law. This principle applies to all solids."], "wikipedia-7282499": ["The surface-area-to-volume ratio, also called the surface-to-volume ratio and variously denoted sa/vol or SA:V, is the amount of surface area per unit volume of an object or collection of objects.\nIn chemical reactions involving a solid material, the surface area to volume ratio is an important factor for the reactivity, that is, the rate at which the chemical reaction will proceed.\nFor a given volume, the object with the smallest surface area (and therefore with the smallest SA:V) is the sphere, a consequence of the isoperimetric inequality in 3 dimensions. By contrast, objects with tiny spikes will have very large surface area for a given volume.\nSection::::Dimension.\nThe surface-area-to-volume ratio has physical dimension L (inverse length) and is therefore expressed in units of inverse distance. As an example, a cube with sides of length 1\u00a0cm will have a surface area of 6\u00a0cm and a volume of 1\u00a0cm. The surface to volume ratio for this cube is thus\nFor a given shape, SA:V is inversely proportional to size. A cube 2\u00a0cm on a side has a ratio of 3\u00a0cm, half that of a cube 1\u00a0cm on a side. Conversely, preserving SA:V as size increases requires changing to a less compact shape.\nSection::::Physical chemistry.\nMaterials with high surface area to volume ratio (e.g. very small diameter, very porous, or otherwise not compact) react at much faster rates than monolithic materials, because more surface is available to react. Examples include grain dust; while grain isn't typically flammable, grain dust is explosive. Finely ground salt dissolves much more quickly than coarse salt.\nHigh surface area to volume ratio provides a strong \"driving force\" to speed up thermodynamic processes that minimize free energy.\nSection::::Biology.\nThe ratio between the surface area and volume of cells and organisms has an enormous impact on their biology, including their physiology and behavior. For example, many aquatic microorganisms have increased surface area to increase their drag in the water. This reduces their rate of sink and allows them to remain near the surface with less energy expenditure.\nAn increased surface area to volume ratio also means increased exposure to the environment. The finely-branched appendages of filter feeders such as krill provide a large surface area to sift the water for food.\nIndividual organs like the lung have numerous internal branchings that increase the surface area; in the case of the lung, the large surface supports gas exchange, bringing oxygen into the blood and releasing carbon dioxide from the blood. Similarly, the small intestine has a finely wrinkled internal surface, allowing the body to absorb nutrients efficiently.\nCells can achieve a high surface area to volume ratio with an elaborately convoluted surface, like the microvilli lining the small intestine.\nIncreased surface area can also lead to biological problems. More contact with the environment through the surface of a cell or an organ (relative to its volume) increases loss of water and dissolved substances. High surface area to volume ratios also present problems of temperature control in unfavorable environments.\nThe surface to volume ratios of organisms of different sizes also leads to some biological rules such as Bergmann's rule and gigantothermy.\nSection::::Fire spread.\nIn the context of wildfires, the ratio of the surface area of a solid fuel to its volume is an important measurement. Fire spread behavior is frequently correlated to the surface-area-to-volume ratio of the fuel (e.g. leaves and branches). The higher its value, the faster a particle responds to changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature or moisture. Higher values are also correlated to shorter fuel ignition times, and hence faster fire spread rates.\nSection::::Planetary cooling.\nA body of icy or rocky material in outer space may, if it can build and retain sufficient heat, develop a differentiated interior and alter its surface through volcanic or tectonic activity. The length of time through which a planetary body can maintain surface-altering activity depends on how well it retains heat, and this is governed by its surface area-to-volume ratio. For Vesta (r=263 km), the ratio is so high that astronomers were surprised to find that it \"did\" differentiate and have brief volcanic activity. The moon, Mercury and Mars have radii in the low thousands of kilometers; all three retained heat well enough to be thoroughly differentiated although after a billion years or so they became too cool to show anything more than very localized and infrequent volcanic activity. As of April 2019, however, NASA has announced the detection of a \"marsquake\" measured on April 6 2019 by NASA's InSight lander . Venus and Earth (r6,000 km) have sufficiently low surface area-to-volume ratios (roughly half that of Mars and much lower than all other known rocky bodies) so that their heat loss is minimal."], "wikipedia-1209": ["Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).\n\nFor a solid shape such as a sphere, cone, or cylinder, the area of its boundary surface is called the surface area. Formulas for the surface areas of simple shapes were computed by the ancient Greeks, but computing the surface area of a more complicated shape usually requires multivariable calculus.\n\nArea plays an important role in modern mathematics. In addition to its obvious importance in geometry and calculus, area is related to the definition of determinants in linear algebra, and is a basic property of surfaces in differential geometry. In analysis, the area of a subset of the plane is defined using Lebesgue measure, though not every subset is measurable. In general, area in higher mathematics is seen as a special case of volume for two-dimensional regions."], "wikipedia-32498": ["Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface, for example, the space that a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or shape occupies or contains. Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i. e., the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces.\nThree dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes. Volumes of some simple shapes, such as regular, straight-edged, and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas. Volumes of complicated shapes can be calculated with integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape's boundary. One-dimensional figures (such as lines) and two-dimensional shapes (such as squares) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space.\nThe volume of a solid (whether regularly or irregularly shaped) can be determined by fluid displacement. Displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas. The combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of just one of the substances. However, sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and in such cases the combined volume is not additive.\nIn \"differential geometry\", volume is expressed by means of the volume form, and is an important global Riemannian invariant.\nIn \"thermodynamics\", volume is a fundamental parameter, and is a conjugate variable to pressure."], "wikipedia-12398": ["A GIS can recognize and analyze the spatial relationships that exist within digitally stored spatial data. These topological relationships allow complex spatial modelling and analysis to be performed. Topological relationships between geometric entities traditionally include adjacency (what adjoins what), containment (what encloses what), and proximity (how close something is to something else).\n\nGeometric networks are linear networks of objects that can be used to represent interconnected features, and to perform special spatial analysis on them. A geometric network is composed of edges, which are connected at junction points, similar to graphs in mathematics and computer science. Just like graphs, networks can have weight and flow assigned to its edges, which can be used to represent various interconnected features more accurately. Geometric networks are often used to model road networks and public utility networks, such as electric, gas, and water networks. Network modeling is also commonly employed in transportation planning, hydrology modeling, and infrastructure modeling.\n\nGIS hydrological models can provide a spatial element that other hydrological models lack, with the analysis of variables such as slope, aspect and watershed or catchment area. Terrain analysis is fundamental to hydrology, since water always flows down a slope. As basic terrain analysis of a digital elevation model (DEM) involves calculation of slope and aspect, DEMs are very useful for hydrological analysis. Slope and aspect can then be used to determine direction of surface runoff, and hence flow accumulation for the formation of streams, rivers and lakes. Areas of divergent flow can also give a clear indication of the boundaries of a catchment. Once a flow direction and accumulation matrix has been created, queries can be performed that show contributing or dispersal areas at a certain point. More detail can be added to the model, such as terrain roughness, vegetation types and soil types, which can influence infiltration and evapotranspiration rates, and hence influencing surface flow. One of the main uses of hydrological modeling is in environmental contamination research. Other applications of hydrological modeling include groundwater and surface water mapping, as well as flood risk maps."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-1730659": 2, "wikipedia-7282499": 2, "wikipedia-5918": 1, "wikipedia-35993402": 1, "wikipedia-1209": 1, "wikipedia-52944974": 1, "wikipedia-285907": 1, "wikipedia-32498": 1, "wikipedia-12398": 2, "wikipedia-20379306": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-1730659": 3, "wikipedia-7282499": 3, "wikipedia-5918": 1, "wikipedia-35993402": 1, "wikipedia-1209": 2, "wikipedia-52944974": 2, "wikipedia-285907": 1, "wikipedia-32498": 2, "wikipedia-12398": 3, "wikipedia-20379306": 1}}}

As an example, consider the case of building a tetrahedron from a triangle, the latter of whose elements are enumerated by row 3 of Pascal's triangle: 1 face, 3 edges, and 3 vertices (the meaning of the final 1 will be explained shortly). To build a tetrahedron from a triangle, we position a new vertex above the plane of the triangle and connect this vertex to all three vertices of the original triangle.\nThe number of a given dimensional element in the tetrahedron is now the sum of two numbers: first the number of that element found in the original triangle, plus the number of new elements, \"each of which is built upon elements of one fewer dimension from the original triangle\". Thus, in the tetrahedron, the number of cells (polyhedral elements) is ; the number of faces is the number of edges is the number of new vertices is . This process of summing the number of elements of a given dimension to those of one fewer dimension to arrive at the number of the former found in the next higher simplex is equivalent to the process of summing two adjacent numbers in a row of Pascal's triangle to yield the number below. Thus, the meaning of the final number (1) in a row of Pascal's triangle becomes understood as representing the new vertex that is to be added to the simplex represented by that row to yield the next higher simplex represented by the next row. This new vertex is joined to every element in the original simplex to yield a new element of one higher dimension in the new simplex, and this is the origin of the pattern found to be identical to that seen in Pascal's triangle.

In 1827 M\u00f6bius realized that a fourth dimension would allow a three-dimensional form to be rotated onto its mirror-image, and by 1853 Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli had discovered many polytopes in higher dimensions, although his work was not published until after his death. Higher dimensions were soon put on firm footing by Bernhard Riemann's 1854 thesis, \"\u00dcber die Hypothesen welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen\", in which he considered a \"point\" to be any sequence of coordinates (\"x\", ..., \"x\"). The possibility of geometry in higher dimensions, including four dimensions in particular, was thus established.\nAn arithmetic of four dimensions called quaternions was defined by William Rowan Hamilton in 1843. This associative algebra was the source of the science of vector analysis in three dimensions as recounted in \"A History of Vector Analysis\". Soon after tessarines and coquaternions were introduced as other four-dimensional algebras over R.\nOne of the first major expositors of the fourth dimension was Charles Howard Hinton, starting in 1880 with his essay \"What is the Fourth Dimension?\"; published in the Dublin University magazine. He coined the terms \"tesseract\", \"ana\" and \"kata\" in his book \"A New Era of Thought\", and introduced a method for visualising the fourth dimension using cubes in the book \"Fourth Dimension\".\nHinton's ideas inspired a fantasy about a \"Church of the Fourth Dimension\" featured by Martin Gardner in his January 1962 \"Mathematical Games column\" in \"Scientific American\". In 1886 Victor Schlegel described his method of visualizing four-dimensional objects with Schlegel diagrams.\nIn 1908, Hermann Minkowski presented a paper consolidating the role of time as the fourth dimension of spacetime, the basis for Einstein's theories of special and general relativity. But the geometry of spacetime, being non-Euclidean, is profoundly different from that popularised by Hinton. The study of Minkowski space required new mathematics quite different from that of four-dimensional Euclidean space, and so developed along quite different lines. This separation was less clear in the popular imagination, with works of fiction and philosophy blurring the distinction, so in 1973 H. S. M. Coxeter felt compelled to write:\nSection::::Vectors.\nMathematically, four-dimensional space is simply a space with four spatial dimensions, that is a space that needs four parameters to specify a point in it. For example, a general point might have position vector a, equal to\nThis can be written in terms of the four standard basis vectors (e, e, e, e), given by\nso the general vector a is\nVectors add, subtract and scale as in three dimensions.\nThe dot product of Euclidean three-dimensional space generalizes to four dimensions as\nIt can be used to calculate the norm or length of a vector,\nand calculate or define the angle between two non-zero vectors as\nMinkowski spacetime is four-dimensional space with geometry defined by a non-degenerate pairing different from the dot product:\nAs an example, the distance squared between the points (0,0,0,0) and (1,1,1,0) is 3 in both the Euclidean and Minkowskian 4-spaces, while the distance squared between (0,0,0,0) and (1,1,1,1) is 4 in Euclidean space and 2 in Minkowski space; increasing formula_8 actually decreases the metric distance. This leads to many of the well-known apparent \"paradoxes\" of relativity.\nThe cross product is not defined in four dimensions. Instead the exterior product is used for some applications, and is defined as follows:\nThis is bivector valued, with bivectors in four dimensions forming a six-dimensional linear space with basis (e, e, e, e, e, e). They can be used to generate rotations in four dimensions.\nSection::::Orthogonality and vocabulary.\nIn the familiar three-dimensional space in which we live, there are three coordinate axes\u2014usually labeled \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\"\u2014with each axis orthogonal (i.e. perpendicular) to the other two. The six cardinal directions in this space can be called \"up\", \"down\", \"east\", \"west\", \"north\", and \"south\". Positions along these axes can be called \"altitude\", \"longitude\", and \"latitude\". Lengths measured along these axes can be called \"height\", \"width\", and \"depth\".\nComparatively, four-dimensional space has an extra coordinate axis, orthogonal to the other three, which is usually labeled \"w\". To describe the two additional cardinal directions, Charles Howard Hinton coined the terms \"ana\" and \"kata\", from the Greek words meaning \"up toward\" and \"down from\", respectively. A position along the \"w\" axis can be called \"spissitude\", as coined by Henry More.\nAs mentioned above, Herman Minkowski exploited the idea of four dimensions to discuss cosmology including the finite velocity of light. In appending a time dimension to three dimensional space, he specified an alternative perpendicularity, hyperbolic orthogonality. This notion provides his four-dimensional space with a modified simultaneity appropriate to electromagnetic relations in his cosmos. Minkowski's world overcame problems associated with the traditional absolute space and time cosmology previously used in a universe of three space dimensions and one time dimension.\nSection::::Geometry.\nThe geometry of four-dimensional space is much more complex than that of three-dimensional space, due to the extra degree of freedom.\nJust as in three dimensions there are polyhedra made of two dimensional polygons, in four dimensions there are 4-polytopes made of polyhedra. In three dimensions, there are 5 regular polyhedra known as the Platonic solids. In four dimensions, there are 6 convex regular 4-polytopes, the analogues of the Platonic solids. Relaxing the conditions for regularity generates a further 58 convex uniform 4-polytopes, analogous to the 13 semi-regular Archimedean solids in three dimensions.

The Cartesian product of two circles may be taken to obtain a duocylinder. All three can \"roll\" in four-dimensional space, each with its own properties.\nIn three dimensions, curves can form knots but surfaces cannot (unless they are self-intersecting). In four dimensions, however, knots made using curves can be trivially untied by displacing them in the fourth direction\u2014but 2D surfaces can form non-trivial, non-self-inter"], "wikipedia-16646944": ["The key observation that leads to Lie sphere geometry is that theorems of Euclidean geometry in the plane (resp. in space) which only depend on the concepts of circles (resp. spheres) and their tangential contact have a more natural formulation in a more general context in which circles, lines and points (resp. spheres, planes and points) are treated on an equal footing. This is achieved in three steps. First an ideal point at infinity is added to Euclidean space so that lines (or planes) can be regarded as circles (or spheres) passing through the point at infinity (i.e., having infinite radius). This extension is known as inversive geometry with automorphisms known as \"Mobius transformations\". Second, points are regarded as circles (or spheres) of zero radius. Finally, for technical reasons, the circles (or spheres), including the lines (or planes) are given orientations.\n\nThese objects, i.e., the points, oriented circles and oriented lines in the plane, or the points, oriented spheres and oriented planes in space, are sometimes called cycles or Lie cycles. It turns out that they form a quadric hypersurface in a projective space of dimension 4 or 5, which is known as the Lie quadric. The natural symmetries of this quadric form a group of transformations known as the Lie transformations. These transformations do not preserve points in general: they are transforms of the Lie quadric, \"not\" of the plane/sphere plus point at infinity. The point-preserving transformations are precisely the M\u00f6bius transformations. The Lie transformations which fix the ideal point at infinity are the Laguerre transformations of Laguerre geometry. These two subgroups generate the group of Lie transformations, and their intersection are the M\u00f6bius transforms that fix the ideal point at infinity, namely the affine conformal maps."], "wikipedia-18973446": ["Section::::Important concepts in geometry.:Dimension.\nWhere the traditional geometry allowed dimensions 1 (a line), 2 (a plane) and 3 (our ambient world conceived of as three-dimensional space), mathematicians have used higher dimensions for nearly two centuries. The concept of dimension has gone through stages of being any natural number \"n\", to being possibly infinite with the introduction of Hilbert space, to being any positive real number in fractal geometry. Dimension theory is a technical area, initially within general topology, that discusses \"definitions\"; in common with most mathematical ideas, dimension is now defined rather than an intuition. Connected topological manifolds have a well-defined dimension; this is a theorem (invariance of domain) rather than anything \"a priori\".\nThe issue of dimension still matters to geometry as many classic questions still lack complete answers. For instance, many open problems in topology depend on the dimension of an object for the result. In physics, dimensions 3 of space and 4 of space-time are special cases in geometric topology, and dimensions 10 and 11 are key ideas in string theory. Currently, the existence of the theoretical dimensions is purely defined by technical reasons; it is likely that further research may result in a \"geometric\" reason for the significance of 10 or 11 dimensions in the theory, lending credibility or possibly disproving string theory.\nSection::::Important concepts in geometry.:Manifolds.\nA manifold is a generalization of the concepts of curve and surface.

His overarching concern was the co-occurring relationship between tensile and compressive tendencies within an eternally regenerative Universe.\nFuller took an intuitive approach to his studies, often going into exhaustive empirical detail while at the same time seeking to cast his findings in their most general philosophical context.\nFor example, his sphere packing studies led him to generalize a formula for polyhedral numbers: 2 P F + 2, where F stands for \"frequency\" (the number of intervals between balls along an edge) and P for a product of low order primes (some integer). He then related the \"multiplicative 2\" and \"additive 2\" in this formula to the convex versus concave aspects of shapes, and to their polar spinnability respectively.\nThese same polyhedra, developed through sphere packing and related by tetrahedral mensuration, he then spun around their various poles to form great circle networks and corresponding triangular tiles on the surface of a sphere. He exhaustively cataloged the central and surface angles of these spherical triangles and their related chord factors.\nFuller was continually on the lookout for ways to connect the dots, often purely speculatively. As an example of \"dot connecting\" he sought to relate the 120 basic disequilibrium LCD triangles of the spherical icosahedron to the plane net of his A module.(915.11Fig. 913.01, Table 905.65)\nThe Jitterbug Transformation provided a unifying dynamic in this work, with much significance attached to the doubling and quadrupling of edges that occurred, when a cuboctahedron is collapsed through icosahedral, octahedral and tetrahedral stages, then inside-outed and re-expanded in a complementary fashion. The JT formed a bridge between 3,4-fold rotationally symmetric shapes, and the 5-fold family, such as a rhombic triacontahedron, which later he analyzed in terms of the T module, another tetrahedral wedge with the same volume as his A and B modules.\nHe modeled energy transfer between systems by means of the double-edged octahedron and its ability to turn into a spiral (tetrahelix). Energy lost to one system always reappeared somewhere else in his Universe. He modeled a threshold between associative and disassociative energy patterns with his T-to-E module transformation (\"E\" for \"Einstein\").(Fig 986.411A)"]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

It is a zonohedron.\nThe ratio of the long diagonal to the short diagonal of each face is exactly equal to the golden ratio, \"\u03c6\", so that the acute angles on each face measure , or approximately 63.43\u00b0. A rhombus so obtained is called a \"golden rhombus\".\nBeing the dual of an Archimedean solid, the rhombic triacontahedron is \"face-transitive\", meaning the symmetry group of the solid acts transitively on the set of faces. This means that for any two faces, A and B, there is a rotation or reflection of the solid that leaves it occupying the same region of space while moving face A to face B.\nThe rhombic triacontahedron is somewhat special in being one of the nine edge-transitive convex polyhedra, the others being the five Platonic solids, the cuboctahedron, the icosidodecahedron, and the rhombic dodecahedron.\nThe rhombic triacontahedron is also interesting in that its vertices include the arrangement of four Platonic solids. It contains ten tetrahedra, five cubes, an icosahedron and a dodecahedron. The centers of the faces contain five octahedra.\nIt can be made from a truncated octahedron by dividing the hexagonal faces into 3 rhombi:\nSection::::Dimensions.\nIf the edge length of a rhombic triacontahedron is \"a\", surface area, volume, the radius of an inscribed sphere (tangent to each of the rhombic triacontahedron's faces) and midradius, which touches the middle of each edge are:\nwhere \"\u03c6\" is the golden ratio.\nThe insphere is tangent to the faces at their face centroids. Short diagonals belong only to the edges of the inscribed regular dodecahedron, while long diagonals are included only in edges of the inscribed icosahedron.\nSection::::Dissection.\nThe rhombic triacontahedron can be dissected into 20 golden rhombohedra: 10 acute ones and 10 obtuse ones.\nSection::::Orthogonal projections.\nThe rhombic triacontahedron has four symmetry positions, two centered on vertices, one mid-face, and one mid-edge. Embedded in projection \"10\" are the \"fat\" rhombus and \"skinny\" rhombus which tile together to produce the non-periodic tessellation often referred to as Penrose tiling.\nSection::::Orthogonal projections.:Stellations.\nThe rhombic triacontahedron has 227 fully supported stellations.

Its dual is the dodecadodecahedron.\nIts 24 vertices are all on the 12 axes with 5-fold symmetry (i.e. each corresponds to one of the 12 vertices of the icosahedron). This means that on each axis there is an inner and an outer vertex.

These systems cannot be learned by rote, but must be developed through familiarity by experiencing numerous examples and counterexamples, the various properties of geometric figures, the relationships between the properties, and how these properties are ordered. Level 0. Visualization: At this level, the focus of a child's thinking is on individual shapes, which the child is learning to classify by judging their holistic appearance. Children simply say, \"That is a circle,\" usually without further description. Children identify prototypes of basic geometrical figures (triangle, circle, square). These visual prototypes are then used to identify other shapes. A shape is a circle because it looks like a sun; a shape is a rectangle because it looks like a door or a box; and so on. A square seems to be a different sort of shape than a rectangle, and a rhombus does not look like other parallelograms, so these shapes are classified completely separately in the child\u2019s mind. Children view figures holistically without analyzing their properties. If a shape does not sufficiently resemble its prototype, the child may reject the classification. Thus, children at this stage might balk at calling a thin, wedge-shaped triangle (with sides 1, 20, 20 or sides 20, 20, 39) a \"triangle\", because it's so different in shape from an equilateral triangle, which is the usual prototype for \"triangle\". If the horizontal base of the triangle is on top and the opposing vertex below, the child may recognize it as a triangle, but claim it is \"upside down\". Shapes with rounded or incomplete sides may be accepted as \"triangles\" if they bear a holistic resemblance to an equilateral triangle. Squares are called \"diamonds\" and not recognized as squares if their sides are oriented at 45\u00b0 to the horizontal. Children at this level often believe something is true based on a single example. Level 1. Analysis: At this level, the shapes become bearers of their properties. The objects of thought are classes of shapes, which the child has learned to analyze as having properties. A person at this level might say, \"A square has 4 equal sides and 4 equal angles. Its diagonals are congruent and perpendicular, and they bisect each other.\" The properties are more important than the appearance of the shape. If a figure is sketched on the blackboard and the teacher claims it is intended to have congruent sides and angles, the students accept that it is a square, even if it is poorly drawn. Properties are not yet ordered at this level. Children can discuss the properties of the basic figures and recognize them by these properties, but generally do not allow categories to overlap because they understand each property in isolation from the others. For example, they will still insist that \"a square is not a rectangle.\" (They may introduce extraneous properties to support such beliefs, such as defining a rectangle as a shape with one pair of sides longer than the other pair of sides.) Children begin to notice many properties of shapes, but do not see the relationships between the properties; therefore they cannot reduce the list of properties to a concise definition with necessary and sufficient conditions. They usually reason inductively from several examples, but cannot yet reason deductively because they do not understand how the properties of shapes are related. Level 2. Abstraction: At this level, properties are ordered. The objects of thought are geometric properties, which the student has learned to connect deductively. The student understands that properties are related and one set of properties may imply another property. Students can reason with simple arguments about geometric figures. A student at this level might say, \"Isosceles triangles are symmetric, so their base angles must be equal.\" Learners recognize the relationships between types of shapes. They recognize that all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares, and they understand why squares are a type of rectangle based on an understanding of the properties of each. They can tell whether it is possible or not to have a rectangle that is, for example, also a rhombus. They understand necessary and sufficient conditions and can write concise definitions. However, they do not yet understand the intrinsic meaning of deduction. They cannot follow a complex argument, understand the place of definitions, or grasp the need for axioms, so they cannot yet understand the role of formal geometric proofs."], "wikipedia-169191": ["Some simple shapes can be put into broad categories. For instance, polygons are classified according to their number of edges as triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, etc. Each of these is divided into smaller categories; triangles can be equilateral, isosceles, obtuse, acute, scalene, etc. while quadrilaterals can be rectangles, rhombi, trapezoids, squares, etc.\nOther common shapes are points, lines, planes, and conic sections such as ellipses, circles, and parabolas.\nAmong the most common 3-dimensional shapes are polyhedra, which are shapes with flat faces; ellipsoids, which are egg-shaped or sphere-shaped objects; cylinders; and cones.\nThere are several ways to compare the shapes of two objects:\nBULLET::::- Congruence: Two objects are congruent if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of rotations, translations, and/or reflections.\nBULLET::::- Similarity: Two objects are similar if one can be transformed into the other by a uniform scaling, together with a sequence of rotations, translations, and/or reflections.\nBULLET::::- Isotopy: Two objects are isotopic if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of deformations that do not tear the object or put holes in it."], "wikipedia-53741": ["A geometric shape or object is symmetric if it can be divided into two or more identical pieces that are arranged in an organized fashion.

The technical statement is that the tori make a foliation of the moduli space. The tori have half the dimension of the moduli space. For instance, the moduli space of formula_25-gons is formula_26 dimensional and the tori in this case are formula_27 dimensional.\n\nThe tori are invisible subsets of the moduli space. They are only revealed when one does the pentagram map and watches a point move round and round, filling up one of the tori. Roughly speaking, when dynamical systems have these invariant tori, they are called integrable systems. Most of the results in this article have to do with establishing that the pentagram map is an integrable system, that these tori really exist. The monodromy invariants, discussed below, turn out to be the equations for the tori. The Poisson bracket, discussed below, is a more sophisticated math gadget that sort of encodes the local geometry of the tori. What is nice is that the various objects fit together exactly, and together add up to a proof that this torus motion really exists."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2. Wikipedia contains detailed articles on various geometric shapes, including their properties, formulas, and related concepts. For example, pages like \"Polygon,\" \"Circle,\" \"Triangle,\" and \"Quadrilateral\" provide comprehensive information on their geometric properties, such as internal angles, symmetry, perimeter, and area. If the shapes in question are standard (e.g., squares, pentagons), Wikipedia would likely have relevant explanations. For more specialized or obscure shapes, additional sources might be needed.", "wikipedia-1220579": ["A geometric shape is the geometric information which remains when location, scale, orientation and reflection are removed from the description of a geometric object. That is, the result of moving a shape around, enlarging it, rotating it, or reflecting it in a mirror is the same shape as the original, and not a distinct shape.\nObjects that have the same shape as each other are said to be similar. If they also have the same scale as each other, they are said to be congruent.\nMany two-dimensional geometric shapes can be defined by a set of points or vertices and lines connecting the points in a closed chain, as well as the resulting interior points. Such shapes are called polygons and include triangles, squares, and pentagons. Other shapes may be bounded by curves such as the circle or the ellipse.\nMany three-dimensional geometric shapes can be defined by a set of vertices, lines connecting the vertices, and two-dimensional faces enclosed by those lines, as well as the resulting interior points. Such shapes are called polyhedrons and include cubes as well as pyramids such as tetrahedrons. Other three-dimensional shapes may be bounded by curved surfaces, such as the ellipsoid and the sphere.\nA shape is said to be convex if all of the points on a line segment between any two of its points are also part of the shape."], "wikipedia-5731861": ["Level 0. Visualization: At this level, the focus of a child's thinking is on individual shapes, which the child is learning to classify by judging their holistic appearance. Children simply say, \"That is a circle,\" usually without further description. Children identify prototypes of basic geometrical figures (triangle, circle, square). These visual prototypes are then used to identify other shapes. A shape is a circle because it looks like a sun; a shape is a rectangle because it looks like a door or a box; and so on. A square seems to be a different sort of shape than a rectangle, and a rhombus does not look like other parallelograms, so these shapes are classified completely separately in the child\u2019s mind. Children view figures holistically without analyzing their properties. If a shape does not sufficiently resemble its prototype, the child may reject the classification. Thus, children at this stage might balk at calling a thin, wedge-shaped triangle (with sides 1, 20, 20 or sides 20, 20, 39) a \"triangle\", because it's so different in shape from an equilateral triangle, which is the usual prototype for \"triangle\". If the horizontal base of the triangle is on top and the opposing vertex below, the child may recognize it as a triangle, but claim it is \"upside down\". Shapes with rounded or incomplete sides may be accepted as \"triangles\" if they bear a holistic resemblance to an equilateral triangle. Squares are called \"diamonds\" and not recognized as squares if their sides are oriented at 45\u00b0 to the horizontal. Children at this level often believe something is true based on a single example.\nLevel 1. Analysis: At this level, the shapes become bearers of their properties. The objects of thought are classes of shapes, which the child has learned to analyze as having properties. A person at this level might say, \"A square has 4 equal sides and 4 equal angles. Its diagonals are congruent and perpendicular, and they bisect each other.\" The properties are more important than the appearance of the shape. If a figure is sketched on the blackboard and the teacher claims it is intended to have congruent sides and angles, the students accept that it is a square, even if it is poorly drawn. Properties are not yet ordered at this level. Children can discuss the properties of the basic figures and recognize them by these properties, but generally do not allow categories to overlap because they understand each property in isolation from the others. For example, they will still insist that \"a square is not a rectangle.\" (They may introduce extraneous properties to support such beliefs, such as defining a rectangle as a shape with one pair of sides longer than the other pair of sides.) Children begin to notice many properties of shapes, but do not see the relationships between the properties; therefore they cannot reduce the list of properties to a concise definition with necessary and sufficient conditions. They usually reason inductively from several examples, but cannot yet reason deductively because they do not understand how the properties of shapes are related.\nLevel 2. Abstraction: At this level, properties are ordered. The objects of thought are geometric properties, which the student has learned to connect deductively. The student understands that properties are related and one set of properties may imply another property. Students can reason with simple arguments about geometric figures. A student at this level might say, \"Isosceles triangles are symmetric, so their base angles must be equal.\" Learners recognize the relationships between types of shapes. They recognize that all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares, and they understand why squares are a type of rectangle based on an understanding of the properties of each. They can tell whether it is possible or not to have a rectangle that is, for example, also a rhombus. They understand necessary and sufficient conditions and can write concise definitions. However, they do not yet understand the intrinsic meaning of deduction. They cannot follow a complex argument, understand the place of definitions, or grasp the need for axioms, so they cannot yet understand the role of formal geometric proofs.\nLevel 3. Deduction: Students at this level understand the meaning of deduction. The object of thought is deductive reasoning (simple proofs), which the student learns to combine to form a system of formal proofs (Euclidean geometry). Learners can construct geometric proofs at a secondary school level and understand their meaning. They understand the role of undefined terms, definitions, axioms and theorems in Euclidean geometry. However, students at this level believe that axioms and definitions are fixed, rather than arbitrary, so they cannot yet conceive of non-Euclidean geometry. Geometric ideas are still understood as objects in the Euclidean plane.\nLevel 4. Rigor: At this level, geometry is understood at the level of a mathematician. Students understand that definitions are arbitrary and need not actually refer to any concrete realization. The object of thought is deductive geometric systems, for which the learner compares axiomatic systems. Learners can study non-Euclidean geometries with understanding. People can understand the discipline of geometry and how it differs philosophically from non-mathematical studies."], "wikipedia-169191": ["Some simple shapes can be put into broad categories. For instance, polygons are classified according to their number of edges as triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, etc. Each of these is divided into smaller categories; triangles can be equilateral, isosceles, obtuse, acute, scalene, etc. while quadrilaterals can be rectangles, rhombi, trapezoids, squares, etc.\nOther common shapes are points, lines, planes, and conic sections such as ellipses, circles, and parabolas.\nAmong the most common 3-dimensional shapes are polyhedra, which are shapes with flat faces; ellipsoids, which are egg-shaped or sphere-shaped objects; cylinders; and cones.\nIf an object falls into one of these categories exactly or even approximately, we can use it to describe the shape of the object. Thus, we say that the shape of a manhole cover is a disk, because it is approximately the same geometric object as an actual geometric disk.\nSection::::Shape in geometry.\nThere are several ways to compare the shapes of two objects:\nBULLET::::- Congruence: Two objects are congruent if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of rotations, translations, and/or reflections.\nBULLET::::- Similarity: Two objects are similar if one can be transformed into the other by a uniform scaling, together with a sequence of rotations, translations, and/or reflections.\nBULLET::::- Isotopy: Two objects are isotopic if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of deformations that do not tear the object or put holes in it.\nSometimes, two similar or congruent objects may be regarded as having a different shape if a reflection is required to transform one into the other. For instance, the letters \"b\" and \"d\" are a reflection of each other, and hence they are congruent and similar, but in some contexts they are not regarded as having the same shape. Sometimes, only the outline or external boundary of the object is considered to determine its shape. For instance, a hollow sphere may be considered to have the same shape as a solid sphere. Procrustes analysis is used in many sciences to determine whether or not two objects have the same shape, or to measure the difference between two shapes. In advanced mathematics, quasi-isometry can be used as a criterion to state that two shapes are approximately the same.\nSimple shapes can often be classified into basic geometric objects such as a point, a line, a curve, a plane, a plane figure (e.g. square or circle), or a solid figure (e.g. cube or sphere). However, most shapes occurring in the physical world are complex. Some, such as plant structures and coastlines, may be so complicated as to defy traditional mathematical description\u00a0\u2013 in which case they may be analyzed by differential geometry, or as fractals."], "wikipedia-53741": ["A geometric shape or object is symmetric if it can be divided into two or more identical pieces that are arranged in an organized fashion. This means that an object is symmetric if there is a transformation that moves individual pieces of the object but doesn't change the overall shape. The type of symmetry is determined by the way the pieces are organized, or by the type of transformation:\nBULLET::::- An object has reflectional symmetry (line or mirror symmetry) if there is a line going through it which divides it into two pieces which are mirror images of each other.\nBULLET::::- An object has rotational symmetry if the object can be rotated about a fixed point without changing the overall shape.\nBULLET::::- An object has translational symmetry if it can be translated without changing its overall shape.\nBULLET::::- An object has helical symmetry if it can be simultaneously translated and rotated in three-dimensional space along a line known as a screw axis.\nBULLET::::- An object has scale symmetry if it does not change shape when it is expanded or contracted. Fractals also exhibit a form of scale symmetry, where small portions of the fractal are similar in shape to large portions.\nBULLET::::- Other symmetries include glide reflection symmetry and rotoreflection symmetry."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-1220579": 2, "wikipedia-5731861": 2, "wikipedia-169191": 2, "wikipedia-22833268": 1, "wikipedia-53741": 2, "wikipedia-16576796": 1, "wikipedia-4577462": 1, "wikipedia-26179254": 1, "wikipedia-30962657": 1, "wikipedia-20410675": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-1220579": 3, "wikipedia-5731861": 3, "wikipedia-169191": 3, "wikipedia-22833268": 1, "wikipedia-53741": 3, "wikipedia-16576796": 1, "wikipedia-4577462": 1, "wikipedia-26179254": 2, "wikipedia-30962657": 1, "wikipedia-20410675": 1}}}

Thus, iron atoms are solid and strong with hooks that lock them into a solid; water atoms are smooth and slippery; salt atoms, because of their taste, are sharp and pointed; and air atoms are light and whirling, pervading all other materials. It was Democritus that was the main proponent of this view. Using analogies based on the experiences of the senses, he gave a picture or an image of an atom in which atoms were distinguished from each other by their shape, their size, and the arrangement of their parts.\n\nIn 1680, using the corpuscular theory as a basis, French chemist Nicolas Lemery stipulated that the acidity of any substance consisted in its pointed particles, while alkalis were endowed with pores of various sizes. A molecule, according to this view, consisted of corpuscles united through a geometric locking of points and pores.\n\nIn 1826, building on the work of Avogadro, the French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas states:\nIn coordination with these concepts, in 1833 the French chemist Marc Antoine Auguste Gaudin presented a clear account of Avogadro's hypothesis, regarding atomic weights, by making use of \"volume diagrams\", which clearly show both semi-correct molecular geometries, such as a linear water molecule, and correct molecular formulas, such as HO:"], "wikipedia-2273604": ["The coordination geometry of an atom is the geometrical pattern formed by atoms around the central atom. In the field of inorganic coordination complexes it is the geometrical pattern formed by the atoms in the ligands that are bonded to the central atom in a molecule or a coordination complex. The geometrical arrangement will vary according to the number and type of ligands bonded to the metal centre, and to the coordination preference of the central atom, typically a metal in a coordination complex. The number of atoms bonded, (i.e. the number of \u03c3-bonds between central atom and ligands) is termed the coordination number. The geometrical pattern can be described as a polyhedron where the vertices of the polyhedron are the centres of the coordinating atoms in the ligands. The coordination preference of a metal often varies with its oxidation state. The number of coordination bonds (coordination number) can vary from two as high as 20 in Th(\u03b7-CH). One of the most common coordination geometries is octahedral, where six ligands are coordinated to the metal in a symmetrical distribution, leading to the formation of an octahedron if lines were drawn between the ligands. Other common coordination geometries are tetrahedral and square planar. Crystal field theory may be used to explain the relative stabilities of transition metal compounds of different coordination geometry, as well as the presence or absence of paramagnetism, whereas VSEPR may be used for complexes of main group element to predict geometry. In a crystal structure the coordination geometry of an atom is the geometrical pattern of coordinating atoms where the definition of coordinating atoms depends on the bonding model used. For example, in the rock salt ionic structure each sodium atom has six near neighbour chloride ions in an octahedral geometry and each chloride has similarly six near neighbour sodium ions in an octahedral geometry.

Patterns in living things are explained by the biological processes of natural selection and sexual selection. Studies of pattern formation make use of computer models to simulate a wide range of patterns.\n\nIn the 19th century, Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau examined soap films, leading him to formulate the concept of a minimal surface. German biologist and artist Ernst Haeckel painted hundreds of marine organisms to emphasise their symmetry. Scottish biologist D'Arcy Thompson pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician Alan Turing predicted mechanisms of morphogenesis which give rise to patterns of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist Aristid Lindenmayer and French American mathematician Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot showed how the mathematics of fractals could create plant growth patterns.\n\nIn 1952, Alan Turing (1912\u20131954), better known for his work on computing and codebreaking, wrote \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\", an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns (dubbed \"Turing patterns\") of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.\n\nThe laws of physics apply the abstractions of mathematics to the real world, often as if it were perfect.

In order to assign a point group for any given molecule, it is necessary to find the set of symmetry operations present on it. The symmetry operation is an action, such as a rotation around an axis or a reflection through a mirror plane. In other words, it is an operation that moves the molecule such that it is indistinguishable from the original configuration.

The first proposal of the modern structure for benzene was due to Kekul\u00e9, in 1865. The cyclic nature of benzene was finally confirmed by the crystallographer Kathleen Lonsdale. Benzene presents a special problem in that, to account for all the bonds, there must be alternating double carbon bonds:\nIn 1874, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff and Joseph Achille Le Bel independently proposed that the phenomenon of optical activity could be explained by assuming that the chemical bonds between carbon atoms and their neighbors were directed towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron. This led to a better understanding of the three-dimensional nature of molecules.\nIn the early 20th century, the American chemist Gilbert N. Lewis began to use dots in lecture, while teaching undergraduates at Harvard, to represent the electrons around atoms. His students favored these drawings, which stimulated him in this direction. From these lectures, Lewis noted that elements with a certain number of electrons seemed to have a special stability. This phenomenon was pointed out by the German chemist Richard Abegg in 1904, to which Lewis referred to as \"Abegg's law of valence\" (now generally known as Abegg's rule). To Lewis it appeared that once a core of eight electrons has formed around a nucleus, the layer is filled, and a new layer is started. Lewis also noted that various ions with eight electrons also seemed to have a special stability. On these views, he proposed the rule of eight or octet rule: \"Ions or atoms with a filled layer of eight electrons have a special stability\".\nIn 1927, the physicists Fritz London and Walter Heitler applied the new quantum mechanics to the deal with the saturable, nondynamic forces of attraction and repulsion, i.e., exchange forces, of the hydrogen molecule. Their valence bond treatment of this problem, in their joint paper, was a landmark in that it brought chemistry under quantum mechanics. Their work was an influence on Pauling, who had just received his doctorate and visited Heitler and London in Z\u00fcrich on a Guggenheim Fellowship.\nSubsequently, in 1931, building on the work of Heitler and London and on theories found in Lewis' famous article, Pauling published his ground-breaking article \"The Nature of the Chemical Bond\" (see: manuscript) in which he used quantum mechanics to calculate properties and structures of molecules, such as angles between bonds and rotation about bonds.

For molecular physics, this approach is known as quantum chemistry. One important aspect of molecular physics is that the essential atomic orbital theory in the field of atomic physics expands to the molecular orbital theory. Molecular physics is concerned with atomic processes in molecules, but it is additionally concerned with effects due to the molecular structure. Additionally to the electronic excitation states which are known from atoms, molecules are able to rotate and to vibrate. These rotations and vibrations are quantized; there are discrete energy levels. The smallest energy differences exist between different rotational states, therefore pure rotational spectra are in the far infrared region (about 30 - 150 \u00b5m wavelength) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Vibrational spectra are in the near infrared (about 1 - 5 \u00b5m) and spectra resulting from electronic transitions are mostly in the visible and ultraviolet regions.

Spectroscopic notation is based on symmetry considerations.\nSection::::Symmetry concepts.\nThe study of symmetry in molecules makes use of group theory.\nSection::::Symmetry concepts.:Elements.\nThe point group symmetry of a molecule can be described by 5 types of symmetry element. \nBULLET::::- Symmetry axis: an axis around which a rotation by formula_1 results in a molecule indistinguishable from the original. This is also called an \"n\"-fold rotational axis and abbreviated C. Examples are the C axis in water and the C axis in ammonia. A molecule can have more than one symmetry axis; the one with the highest \"n\" is called the principal axis, and by convention is aligned with the z-axis in a Cartesian coordinate system.\nBULLET::::- Plane of symmetry: a plane of reflection through which an identical copy of the original molecule is generated. This is also called a mirror plane and abbreviated \u03c3 (sigma = Greek \"s\", from the German 'Spiegel' meaning mirror). Water has two of them: one in the plane of the molecule itself and one perpendicular to it. A symmetry plane parallel with the principal axis is dubbed \"vertical\" (\u03c3) and one perpendicular to it \"horizontal\" (\u03c3). A third type of symmetry plane exists: If a vertical symmetry plane additionally bisects the angle between two 2-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the principal axis, the plane is dubbed dihedral (\u03c3). A symmetry plane can also be identified by its Cartesian orientation, e.g., (xz) or (yz).\nBULLET::::- Center of symmetry or inversion center, abbreviated \"i\". A molecule has a center of symmetry when, for any atom in the molecule, an identical atom exists diametrically opposite this center an equal distance from it. In other words, a molecule has a center of symmetry when the points (x,y,z) and (\u2212x,\u2212y,\u2212z) correspond to identical objects. For example, if there is an oxygen atom in some point (x,y,z), then there is an oxygen atom in the point (\u2212x,\u2212y,\u2212z). There may or may not be an atom at the inversion center itself. Examples are xenon tetrafluoride where the inversion center is at the Xe atom, and benzene (CH) where the inversion center is at the center of the ring.\nBULLET::::- Rotation-reflection axis: an axis around which a rotation by formula_1, followed by a reflection in a plane perpendicular to it, leaves the molecule unchanged. Also called an \"n\"-fold improper rotation axis, it is abbreviated S. Examples are present in tetrahedral silicon tetrafluoride, with three S axes, and the staggered conformation of ethane with one S axis. An S axis corresponds to a mirror plane \u03c3 and an S axis is an inversion center \"i\". A molecule which has no S axis for any value of n is a chiral molecule.\nBULLET::::- Identity, abbreviated to E, from the German 'Einheit' meaning unity. This symmetry element simply consists of no change: every molecule has this element. While this element seems physically trivial, it must be included in the list of symmetry elements so that they form a mathematical group, whose definition requires inclusion of the identity element. It is so called because it is analogous to multiplying by one (unity). In other words, E is a property that any object needs to have regardless of its symmetry properties.\nSection::::Symmetry concepts.:Operations.\nThe five symmetry elements have associated with them five types of symmetry operation, which leave the molecule in a state indistinguishable from the starting state. They are sometimes distinguished from symmetry elements by a caret or circumflex. Thus, \u0108 is the rotation of a molecule around an axis and \u00ca is the identity operation. A symmetry element can have more than one symmetry operation associated with it. For example, the C axis of the square xenon tetrafluoride (XeF) molecule is associated with two \u0108 rotations (90\u00b0) in opposite directions and a \u0108 rotation (180\u00b0). Since \u0108 is equivalent to \u00ca, \u015c to \u03c3 and \u015c to \"\u00ee\", all symmetry operations can be classified as either proper or improper rotations."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-25420967": 1, "wikipedia-31838482": 1, "wikipedia-7071490": 1, "wikipedia-10986798": 1, "wikipedia-675130": 1, "wikipedia-16090759": 1, "wikipedia-838846": 1, "wikipedia-5731861": 1, "wikipedia-48579": 1, "wikipedia-24812935": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-25420967": 1, "wikipedia-31838482": 1, "wikipedia-7071490": 2, "wikipedia-10986798": 2, "wikipedia-675130": 1, "wikipedia-16090759": 1, "wikipedia-838846": 1, "wikipedia-5731861": 1, "wikipedia-48579": 2, "wikipedia-24812935": 1}}}
