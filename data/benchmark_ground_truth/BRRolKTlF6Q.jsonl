In this sense, 0 is the \"most even\" number of all.\nAmong the general public, the parity of zero can be a source of confusion. In reaction time experiments, most people are slower to identify 0 as even than 2, 4, 6, or 8. Some students of mathematics\u2014and some teachers\u2014think that zero is odd, or both even and odd, or neither. Researchers in mathematics education propose that these misconceptions can become learning opportunities. Studying equalities like can address students' doubts about calling 0 a number and using it in arithmetic. Class discussions can lead students to appreciate the basic principles of mathematical reasoning, such as the importance of definitions. Evaluating the parity of this exceptional number is an early example of a pervasive theme in mathematics: the abstraction of a familiar concept to an unfamiliar setting.\nSection::::Why zero is even.\nThe standard definition of \"even number\" can be used to directly prove that zero is even. A number is called \"even\" if it is an integer multiple of 2. As an example, the reason that 10 is even is that it equals . In the same way, zero is an integer multiple of 2, namely so zero is even.\nIt is also possible to explain why zero is even without referring to formal definitions. The following explanations make sense of the idea that zero is even in terms of fundamental number concepts. From this foundation, one can provide a rationale for the definition itself\u2014and its applicability to zero.\nSection::::Why zero is even.:Basic explanations.\nGiven a set of objects, one uses a number to describe how many objects are in the set. Zero is the count of \"no objects\"; in more formal terms, it is the number of objects in the empty set. The concept of parity is used for making groups of two objects. If the objects in a set can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number of objects is even. If an object is left over, then the number of objects is odd. The empty set contains zero groups of two, and no object is left over from this grouping, so zero is even.\nThese ideas can be illustrated by drawing objects in pairs. It is difficult to depict zero groups of two, or to emphasize the nonexistence of a leftover object, so it helps to draw other groupings and to compare them with zero. For example, in the group of five objects, there are two pairs. More importantly, there is a leftover object, so 5 is odd. In the group of four objects, there is no leftover object, so 4 is even. In the group of just one object, there are no pairs, and there is a leftover object, so 1 is odd. In the group of zero objects, there is no leftover object, so 0 is even.\nThere is another concrete definition of evenness: if the objects in a set can be placed into two groups of equal size, then the number of objects is even. This definition is equivalent to the first one. Again, zero is even because the empty set can be divided into two groups of zero items each.\nNumbers can also be visualized as points on a number line. When even and odd numbers are distinguished from each other, their pattern becomes obvious, especially if negative numbers are included:\nThe even and odd numbers alternate. Starting at any even number, counting up or down by twos reaches the other even numbers, and there is no reason to skip over zero.\nWith the introduction of multiplication, parity can be approached in a more formal way using arithmetic expressions. Every integer is either of the form or the former numbers are even and the latter are odd. For example, 1 is odd because and 0 is even because Making a table of these facts then reinforces the number line picture above.\nSection::::Why zero is even.:Defining parity.\nThe precise definition of a mathematical term, such as \"even\" meaning \"integer multiple of two\", is ultimately a convention. Unlike \"even\", some mathematical terms are purposefully constructed to exclude trivial or degenerate cases. Prime numbers are a famous example. Before the 20th century, definitions of primality were inconsistent, and significant mathematicians such as Goldbach, Lambert, Legendre, Cayley, and Kronecker wrote that 1 was prime. The modern definition of \"prime number\" is \"positive integer with exactly 2 factors\", so 1 is not prime. This definition can be rationalized by observing that it more naturally suits mathematical theorems that concern the primes. For example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is easier to state when 1 is not considered prime.\nIt would be possible to similarly redefine the term \"even\" in a way that no longer includes zero. However, in this case, the new definition would make it more difficult to state theorems concerning the even numbers. Already the effect can be seen in the algebraic rules governing even and odd numbers. The most relevant rules concern addition, subtraction, and multiplication:\nInserting appropriate values into the left sides of these rules, one can produce 0 on the right sides:\nThe above rules would therefore be incorrect if zero were not even. At best they would have to be modified. For example, one test study guide asserts that even numbers are characterized as integer multiples of two, but zero is \"neither even nor odd\". Accordingly, the guide's rules for even and odd numbers contain exceptions:\nMaking an exception for zero in the definition of evenness forces one to make such exceptions in the rules for even numbers. From another perspective, taking the rules obeyed by positive even numbers and requiring that they continue to hold for integers forces the usual definition and the evenness of zero.\nSection::::Mathematical contexts.\nCountless results in number theory invoke the fundamental theorem of arithmetic and the algebraic properties of even numbers, so the above choices have far-reaching consequences. For example, the fact that positive numbers have unique factorizations means that one can determine whether a number has an even or odd number of distinct prime factors. Since 1 is not prime, nor does it have prime factors, it is a product of 0 distinct primes; since 0 is an even number, 1 has an even number of distinct prime factors. This implies that the M\u00f6bius function takes the value , which is necessary for it to be a multiplicative function and for the M\u00f6bius inversion formula to work.\nSection::::Mathematical contexts.:Not being odd.\nA number is odd if there is an integer such that . One way to prove that zero is not odd is by contradiction: if then , which is not an integer. Since zero is not odd, if an unknown number is proven to be odd, then it cannot be zero. This apparently trivial observation can provide a convenient and revealing proof explaining why a number is nonzero.\nA classic result of graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always has at least one vertex of even degree. (The statement itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an \"odd number\" of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.\nSperner's lemma is a more advanced application of the same strategy. The lemma states that a certain kind of coloring on a triangulation of a simplex has a subsimplex that contains every color. Rather than directly construct such a subsimplex, it is more convenient to prove that there exists an odd number of such subsimplices through an induction argument. A stronger statement of the lemma then explains why this number is odd: it naturally breaks down as when one considers the two possible orientations of a simplex.\nSection::::Mathematical contexts.:Even-odd alternation.\nThe fact that zero is even, together with the fact that even and odd numbers alternate, is enough to determine the parity of every other natural number. This idea can be formalized into a recursive definition of the set of even natural numbers:\nBULLET::::- 0 is even.\nBULLET::::- (\"n\" + 1) is even if and only if \"n\" is not even.\nThis definition has the conceptual advantage of relying only on the minimal foundations of the natural numbers: the existence of 0 and of successors. As such, it is useful for computer logic systems such as LF and the Isabelle theorem..."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-23670": 1, "wikipedia-13259237": 2, "wikipedia-1561666": 1, "wikipedia-1819983": 1, "wikipedia-169358": 1, "wikipedia-208171": 1, "wikipedia-1500869": 1, "wikipedia-3052977": 1, "wikipedia-322008": 1, "wikipedia-2161615": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-23670": 1, "wikipedia-13259237": 3, "wikipedia-1561666": 1, "wikipedia-1819983": 1, "wikipedia-169358": 1, "wikipedia-208171": 1, "wikipedia-1500869": 1, "wikipedia-3052977": 1, "wikipedia-322008": 1, "wikipedia-2161615": 1}}}

So, for dividing by zero, what is the number of cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed amongst 0 people at a table? Certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem. The problem with this question is the \"when\". There is no way to distribute 10 cookies to nobody. In mathematical jargon, a set of 10 items cannot be partitioned into 0 subsets. So , at least in elementary arithmetic, is said to be either meaningless, or undefined.\n\nAnother way of looking at division by zero is that division can always be checked using multiplication. Considering the example above, setting \"x\" = , if \"x\" equals ten divided by zero, then \"x\" times zero equals ten, but there is no \"x\" that, when multiplied by zero, gives ten (or any number other than zero). If instead of \"x\" = , \"x\" = , then every \"x\" satisfies the question 'what number \"x\", multiplied by zero, gives zero?'\n\nIn general, a single value can't be assigned to a fraction where the denominator is 0 so the value remains undefined."], "wikipedia-15139692": ["Division by zero is a term used in mathematics if the divisor (denominator) is zero."], "wikipedia-53696": ["In these enlarged number systems, division is the inverse operation to multiplication, that is means , as long as is not zero.

As an example, consider having ten cookies, and these cookies are to be distributed equally to five people at a table. Each person would receive = 2 cookies. Similarly, if there are ten cookies, and only one person at the table, that person would receive = 10 cookies.\nSo, for dividing by zero, what is the number of cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed amongst 0 people at a table?

So , at least in elementary arithmetic, is said to be either meaningless, or undefined.\nSimilar problems occur with 0 cookies and 0 people, but this time the problem is in the phrase \"the number\". A partition is possible (of a set with 0 elements into 0 parts), but since the partition has 0 parts, vacuously every set in the partition has a given number of elements, be it 0, 2, 5, or 1000.\nIf there are, say, 5 cookies and 2 people, the problem is in \"evenly distribute\".

Such a division can be formally expressed as where \"a\" is the dividend (numerator). In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has no meaning, as there is no number which, when multiplied by 0, gives \"a\" (assuming \"a\" \u2260 0), and so division by zero is undefined. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the expression is also undefined; when it is the form of a limit, it is an indeterminate form. Section::::Elementary arithmetic. When division is explained at the elementary arithmetic level, it is often considered as splitting a set of objects into equal parts. As an example, consider having ten cookies, and these cookies are to be distributed equally to five people at a table. Each person would receive = 2 cookies. Similarly, if there are ten cookies, and only one person at the table, that person would receive = 10 cookies. So, for dividing by zero, what is the number of cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed amongst 0 people at a table? Certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem. The problem with this question is the \"when\". There is no way to distribute 10 cookies to nobody. In mathematical jargon, a set of 10 items cannot be partitioned into 0 subsets. So , at least in elementary arithmetic, is said to be either meaningless, or undefined. Another way of looking at division by zero is that division can always be checked using multiplication. Considering the example above, setting \"x\" = , if \"x\" equals ten divided by zero, then \"x\" times zero equals ten, but there is no \"x\" that, when multiplied by zero, gives ten (or any number other than zero). If instead of \"x\" = , \"x\" = , then every \"x\" satisfies the question 'what number \"x\", multiplied by zero, gives zero?' Section::::Algebra.:Division as the inverse of multiplication. The concept that explains division in algebra is that it is the inverse of multiplication. For example, since 2 is the value for which the unknown quantity in is true. But the expression requires a value to be found for the unknown quantity in But any number multiplied by 0 is 0 and so there is no number that solves the equation. The expression requires a value to be found for the unknown quantity in Again, any number multiplied by 0 is 0 and so this time every number solves the equation instead of there being a single number that can be taken as the value of 0/0. In general, a single value can't be assigned to a fraction where the denominator is 0 so the value remains undefined. Section::::Algebra.:Fallacies. A compelling reason for not allowing division by zero is that, if it were allowed, many absurd results (i.e., fallacies) would arise. When working with numerical quantities it is easy to determine when an illegal attempt to divide by zero is being made. For example, consider the following computation. With the assumptions: the following is true: Dividing both sides by zero gives: Simplified, this yields: The fallacy here is the assumption that dividing by 0 is a legitimate operation with the same properties as dividing by any other number."], "wikipedia-53696": ["In these enlarged number systems, division is the inverse operation to multiplication, that is means , as long as is not zero.

The coordinates of the points on the curve are of the form formula_2 where x is a number other than 0. For example, the graph contains the points (1, 1), (2, 0.5), (5, 0.2), (10, 0.1), \u2026 As the values of formula_3 become larger and larger, say 100, 1,000, 10,000 \u2026, putting them far to the right of the illustration, the corresponding values of formula_4, .01, .001, .0001, \u2026, become infinitesimal relative to the scale shown. But no matter how large formula_3 becomes, its reciprocal formula_6 is never 0, so the curve never actually touches the \"x\"-axis. Similarly, as the values of formula_3 become smaller and smaller, say .01, .001, .0001, \u2026, making them infinitesimal relative to the scale shown, the corresponding values of formula_4, 100, 1,000, 10,000 \u2026, become larger and larger. So the curve extends farther and farther upward as it comes closer and closer to the \"y\"-axis. Thus, both the \"x\" and \"y\"-axes are asymptotes of the curve. These ideas are part of the basis of concept of a limit in mathematics, and this connection is explained more fully below."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-26024794": 3, "wikipedia-11321984": 1, "wikipedia-641995": 3, "wikipedia-642006": 1, "wikipedia-44578": 1, "wikipedia-192989": 1, "wikipedia-45197219": 1, "wikipedia-50734392": 1, "wikipedia-3107": 3, "wikipedia-51525633": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-26024794": 3, "wikipedia-11321984": 1, "wikipedia-641995": 3, "wikipedia-642006": 1, "wikipedia-44578": 2, "wikipedia-192989": 1, "wikipedia-45197219": 2, "wikipedia-50734392": 1, "wikipedia-3107": 3, "wikipedia-51525633": 1}}}

For instance, a lawyer defending someone accused of damaging property might pose the following questions:\nBULLET::::- Question of fact: did the person damage the item?

(translative)\n\nThe question of fact is key as the first step in formulating any argument is separating the true from the false. If the terms of the argument at hand cannot be agreed on, the discussion will not move in any positive direction.

A political disagreement should be investigated with a different lens than a criminal case, for example, as they are concerns of a different nature.\n\nThe question of quality means identifying the magnitude of the event, the wider impacts, as well as what would happen if no action were to be taken. Identifying if this problem is important as part of a bigger picture is key to preparing a sound argument, as well as figuring out whether or not it is a cause worth pursuing. The quality aspect of stasis comes down to deciding if this particular problem requires attention, and at what cost will a resolution come about.\n\nThe question of jurisdiction means formulating a plan of action.

In the 1830s Libri published an unconvincing argument for formula_21, and M\u00f6bius sided with him, erroneously claiming that formula_25 whenever formula_26. A commentator who signed his name simply as \"S\" provided the counterexample of formula_27, and this quieted the debate for some time. More historical details can be found in Knuth (1992).\nMore recent authors interpret the situation above in different ways:\nBULLET::::- Some argue that the best value for formula_20 depends on context, and hence that defining it once and for all is problematic. According to Benson (1999), \"The choice whether to define formula_20 is based on convenience, not on correctness. If we refrain from defining formula_20, then certain assertions become unnecessarily awkward.

At that time, most mathematicians agreed that formula_21, until in 1821 Cauchy listed formula_20 along with expressions like formula_23 in a table of indeterminate forms. In the 1830s Libri published an unconvincing argument for formula_21, and M\u00f6bius sided with him, erroneously claiming that formula_25 whenever formula_26. A commentator who signed his name simply as \"S\" provided the counterexample of formula_27, and this quieted the debate for some time. More historical details can be found in Knuth (1992).\nMore recent authors interpret the situation above in different ways:\nBULLET::::- Some argue that the best value for formula_20 depends on context, and hence that defining it once and for all is problematic. According to Benson (1999), \"The choice whether to define formula_20 is based on convenience, not on correctness. If we refrain from defining formula_20, then certain assertions become unnecessarily awkward. [...] The consensus is to use the definition formula_31, although there are textbooks that refrain from defining formula_20.\"\nBULLET::::- Others argue that formula_20 should be defined as 1. Knuth (1992) contends strongly that formula_20 \"\"has\" to be 1\", drawing a distinction between the \"value\" formula_20, which should equal 1 as advocated by Libri, and the \"limiting form\" formula_20 (an abbreviation for a limit of formula_37 where formula_38), which is necessarily an indeterminate form as listed by Cauchy: \"Both Cauchy and Libri were right, but Libri and his defenders did not understand why truth was on their side.\" Vaughn gives several other examples of theorems whose (simplest) statements require 0 = 1 as a convention."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-24334988": 1, "wikipedia-50167582": 1, "wikipedia-9914115": 1, "wikipedia-11857532": 1, "wikipedia-24738627": 1, "wikipedia-9519121": 1, "wikipedia-18030": 1, "wikipedia-12139922": 1, "wikipedia-32130416": 2, "wikipedia-4597914": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-24334988": 1, "wikipedia-50167582": 1, "wikipedia-9914115": 1, "wikipedia-11857532": 1, "wikipedia-24738627": 1, "wikipedia-9519121": 1, "wikipedia-18030": 1, "wikipedia-12139922": 1, "wikipedia-32130416": 3, "wikipedia-4597914": 1}}}

They argue that if a person's attitude towards a proposition fits their evidence, then their doxastic attitude for that proposition is epistemically justified. Feldman and Conee offer the following argument for evidentialism as an epistemic justification:\n(EJ) Doxastic attitude \"D\" toward proposition \"p\" is epistemically justified for \"S\" at \"t\" if and only if having \"D\" toward \"p\" fits the evidence.\nFor Feldman and Conee a person's doxastic attitude is justified if it fits their evidence.

AoA determines the direction by measuring the time difference of arrival (TDOA) at individual elements of the array -- from these delays the AoA can be calculated. \nGenerally this TDOA measurement is made by measuring the difference in received phase at each element in the antenna array. This can be thought of as beamforming in reverse. In beamforming, the signal from each element is weighed to \"steer\" the gain of the antenna array. In AoA, the delay of arrival at each element is measured directly and converted to an AoA measurement.\nConsider, for example, a two element array spaced apart by one-half the wavelength of an incoming RF wave. If a wave is incident upon the array at boresight, it will arrive at each antenna simultaneously. This will yield 0\u00b0 phase-difference measured between the two antenna elements, equivalent to a 0\u00b0 AoA. If a wave is incident upon the array at broadside, then a 180\u00b0 phase difference will be measured between the elements, corresponding to a 90\u00b0 AoA."], "wikipedia-232102": ["In fluid dynamics, angle of attack (AOA, \u03b1, or formula_1) is the angle between a reference line on a body (often the chord line of an airfoil) and the vector representing the relative motion between the body and the fluid through which it is moving. Angle of attack is the angle between the body's reference line and the oncoming flow. This article focuses on the most common application, the angle of attack of a wing or airfoil moving through air.\n\nIn aerodynamics, angle of attack specifies the angle between the chord line of the wing of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vector representing the relative motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere. Since a wing can have twist, a chord line of the whole wing may not be definable, so an alternate reference line is simply defined. Often, the chord line of the root of the wing is chosen as the reference line. Another choice is to use a horizontal line on the fuselage as the reference line (and also as the longitudinal axis). Some authors do not use an arbitrary chord line but use the zero lift axis where, by definition, zero angle of attack corresponds to zero coefficient of lift.\n\nThe lift coefficient of a fixed-wing aircraft varies with angle of attack. Increasing angle of attack is associated with increasing lift coefficient up to the maximum lift coefficient, after which lift coefficient decreases.\n\nAs the angle of attack of a fixed-wing aircraft increases, separation of the airflow from the upper surface of the wing becomes more pronounced, leading to a reduction in the rate of increase of the lift coefficient. The figure shows a typical curve for a cambered straight wing. Cambered airfoils are curved such that they generate some lift at small negative angles of attack. A symmetrical wing has zero lift at 0 degrees angle of attack. The lift curve is also influenced by the wing shape, including its airfoil section and wing planform. A swept wing has a lower, flatter curve with a higher critical angle.\n\nThe critical angle of attack is the angle of attack which produces maximum lift coefficient. This is also called the \"stall angle of attack\". Below the critical angle of attack, as the angle of attack decreases, the lift coefficient decreases. Conversely, above the critical angle of attack, as angle of attack increases, the air begins to flow less smoothly over the upper surface of the airfoil and begins to separate from the upper surface. On most airfoil shapes, as the angle of attack increases, the upper surface separation point of the flow moves from the trailing edge towards the leading edge. At the critical angle of attack, upper surface flow is more separated and the airfoil or wing is producing its maximum lift coefficient. As angle of attack increases further, the upper surface flow becomes more fully separated and the lift coefficient reduces further.\n\nAbove this critical angle of attack, the aircraft is said to be in a stall. A fixed-wing aircraft by definition is stalled at or above the critical angle of attack rather than at or below a particular airspeed. The airspeed at which the aircraft stalls varies with the weight of the aircraft, the load factor, the center of gravity of the aircraft and other factors. However the aircraft always stalls at the same critical angle of attack. The critical or stalling angle of attack is typically around 15\u00b0 - 20\u00b0 for many airfoils."], "wikipedia-4074422": ["This is useful when a policy or fund provides a guarantee, e.g. a minimum investment return of 5% per annum. A deterministic simulation, with varying scenarios for future investment return, does not provide a good way of estimating the cost of providing this guarantee. This is because it does not allow for the volatility of investment returns in each future time period or the chance that an extreme event in a particular time period leads to an investment return less than the guarantee. Stochastic modelling builds volatility and variability (randomness) into the simulation and therefore provides a better representation of real life from more angles."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-3736883": 1, "wikipedia-44596487": 1, "wikipedia-3736689": 1, "wikipedia-3339367": 1, "wikipedia-2201447": 1, "wikipedia-232102": 1, "wikipedia-43473088": 1, "wikipedia-15092946": 1, "wikipedia-200505": 1, "wikipedia-4074422": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-3736883": 1, "wikipedia-44596487": 2, "wikipedia-3736689": 1, "wikipedia-3339367": 2, "wikipedia-2201447": 2, "wikipedia-232102": 2, "wikipedia-43473088": 1, "wikipedia-15092946": 1, "wikipedia-200505": 1, "wikipedia-4074422": 2}}}

The first method measures some physical phenomenon that is expected to be random and then compensates for possible biases in the measurement process. Example sources include measuring atmospheric noise, thermal noise, and other external electromagnetic and quantum phenomena. For example, cosmic background radiation or radioactive decay as measured over short timescales represent sources of natural entropy.\n\nThe speed at which entropy can be harvested from natural sources is dependent on the underlying physical phenomena being measured. Thus, sources of naturally occurring \"true\" entropy are said to be blocking they are rate-limited until enough entropy is harvested to meet the demand. On some Unix-like systems, including most Linux distributions, the pseudo device file will block until sufficient entropy is harvested from the environment. Due to this blocking behavior, large bulk reads from , such as filling a hard disk drive with random bits, can often be slow on systems that use this type of entropy source.\n\nThe second method uses computational algorithms that can produce long sequences of apparently random results, which are in fact completely determined by a shorter initial value, known as a seed value or key. As a result, the entire seemingly random sequence can be reproduced if the seed value is known. This type of random number generator is often called a pseudorandom number generator. This type of generator typically does not rely on sources of naturally occurring entropy, though it may be periodically seeded by natural sources. This generator type is non-blocking, so they are not rate-limited by an external event, making large bulk reads a possibility.\n\nSome systems take a hybrid approach, providing randomness harvested from natural sources when available, and falling back to periodically re-seeded software-based cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs). The fallback occurs when the desired read rate of randomness exceeds the ability of the natural harvesting approach to keep up with the demand. This approach avoids the rate-limited blocking behavior of random number generators based on slower and purely environmental methods.\n\nWhile a pseudorandom number generator based solely on deterministic logic can never be regarded as a \"true\" random number source in the purest sense of the word, in practice they are generally sufficient even for demanding security-critical applications. Indeed, carefully designed and implemented pseudo-random number generators can be certified for security-critical cryptographic purposes, as is the case with the yarrow algorithm and fortuna. The former is the basis of the source of entropy on FreeBSD, AIX, OS X, NetBSD, and others. OpenBSD also uses a pseudo-random number algorithm based on ChaCha20 known as arc4random."], "wikipedia-160506": ["A hardware random number generator typically consists of a transducer to convert some aspect of the physical phenomena to an electrical signal, an amplifier and other electronic circuitry to increase the amplitude of the random fluctuations to a measurable level, and some type of analog to digital converter to convert the output into a digital number, often a simple binary digit 0 or 1.

In AoA, the delay of arrival at each element is measured directly and converted to an AoA measurement.\nConsider, for example, a two element array spaced apart by one-half the wavelength of an incoming RF wave.

This will yield 0\u00b0 phase-difference measured between the two antenna elements, equivalent to a 0\u00b0 AoA.

Angle of attack is the angle between the body's reference line and the oncoming flow. This article focuses on the most common application, the angle of attack of a wing or airfoil moving through air.\nIn aerodynamics, angle of attack specifies the angle between the chord line of the wing of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vector representing the relative motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere. Since a wing can have twist, a chord line of the whole wing may not be definable, so an alternate reference line is simply defined. Often, the chord line of the root of the wing is chosen as the reference line. Another choice is to use a horizontal line on the fuselage as the reference line (and also as the longitudinal axis). Some authors do not use an arbitrary chord line but use the zero lift axis where, by definition, zero angle of attack corresponds to zero coefficient of lift.\nThe lift coefficient of a fixed-wing aircraft varies with angle of attack. Increasing angle of attack is associated with increasing lift coefficient up to the maximum lift coefficient, after which lift coefficient decreases.\nAs the angle of attack of a fixed-wing aircraft increases, separation of the airflow from the upper surface of the wing becomes more pronounced, leading to a reduction in the rate of increase of the lift coefficient. The figure shows a typical curve for a cambered straight wing. Cambered airfoils are curved such that they generate some lift at small negative angles of attack. A symmetrical wing has zero lift at 0 degrees angle of attack. The lift curve is also influenced by the wing shape, including its airfoil section and wing planform. A swept wing has a lower, flatter curve with a higher critical angle.\nThe critical angle of attack is the angle of attack which produces maximum lift coefficient. This is also called the \"stall angle of attack\". Below the critical angle of attack, as the angle of attack decreases, the lift coefficient decreases. Conversely, above the critical angle of attack, as angle of attack increases, the air begins to flow less smoothly over the upper surface of the airfoil and begins to separate from the upper surface. On most airfoil shapes, as the angle of attack increases, the upper surface separation point of the flow moves from the trailing edge towards the leading edge. At the critical angle of attack, upper surface flow is more separated and the airfoil or wing is producing its maximum lift coefficient. As angle of attack increases further, the upper surface flow becomes more fully separated and the lift coefficient reduces further.\nAbove this critical angle of attack, the aircraft is said to be in a stall. A fixed-wing aircraft by definition is stalled at or above the critical angle of attack rather than at or below a particular airspeed. The airspeed at which the aircraft stalls varies with the weight of the aircraft, the load factor, the center of gravity of the aircraft and other factors. However the aircraft always stalls at the same critical angle of attack. The critical or stalling angle of attack is typically around 15\u00b0 - 20\u00b0 for many airfoils."], "wikipedia-40815": ["The Fresnel equations predict that light with the \"p\" polarization (electric field polarized in the same plane as the incident ray and the surface normal at the point of incidence) will not be reflected if the angle of incidence is \nwhere \"n\" is the refractive index of the initial medium through which the light propagates (the \"incident medium\"), and \"n\" is the index of the other medium. This equation is known as Brewster's law, and the angle defined by it is Brewster's angle.\nThe physical mechanism for this can be qualitatively understood from the manner in which electric dipoles in the media respond to \"p\"-polarized light. One can imagine that light incident on the surface is absorbed, and then re-radiated by oscillating electric dipoles at the interface between the two media. The polarization of freely propagating light is always perpendicular to the direction in which the light is travelling. The dipoles that produce the transmitted (refracted) light oscillate in the polarization direction of that light. These same oscillating dipoles also generate the reflected light. However, dipoles do not radiate any energy in the direction of the dipole moment. If the refracted light is \"p\"-polarized and propagates exactly perpendicular to the direction in which the light is predicted to be specularly reflected, the dipoles point along the specular reflection direction and therefore no light can be reflected. (See diagram, above)\nWith simple geometry this condition can be expressed as\nwhere \"\u03b8\" is the angle of reflection (or incidence) and \"\u03b8\" is the angle of refraction.\nUsing Snell's law,\none can calculate the incident angle at which no light is reflected:\nSolving for \"\u03b8\" gives\nFor a glass medium () in air (), Brewster's angle for visible light is approximately 56\u00b0, while for an air-water interface (), it is approximately 53\u00b0.

Philosophers have speculated about the nature of the infinite, for example Zeno of Elea, who proposed many paradoxes involving infinity, and Eudoxus of Cnidus, who used the idea of infinitely small quantities in his method of exhaustion. This idea is also at the basis of infinitesimal calculus.\nAt the end of 19th century, Georg Cantor introduced and studied infinite sets and infinite numbers, which are now an essential part of the foundation of mathematics. For example, in modern mathematics, a line is commonly viewed as the set of all its points, and their infinite number (the cardinality of the line) is larger than the number of integers. Thus the mathematical concept of infinity refines and extends the old philosophical concept. It is used everywhere in mathematics, even in areas such as combinatorics and number theory that may seem to have nothing to do with it. For example, Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem uses the existence of very large infinite sets.\nThe earliest recorded idea of infinity comes from Anaximander, a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus. He used the word apeiron which means infinite or limitless. However, the earliest attestable accounts of mathematical infinity come from Zeno of Elea (born ), a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher of southern Italy and member of the Eleatic School founded by Parmenides. Aristotle called him the inventor of the dialectic. He is best known for his paradoxes, described by Bertrand Russell as \"immeasurably subtle and profound\".\nThe Jain mathematical text Surya Prajnapti (c. 4th\u20133rd century BCE) classifies all numbers into three sets: enumerable, innumerable, and infinite.

On both physical and ontological grounds, a distinction was made between  (\"countless, innumerable\") and \"ananta\" (\"endless, unlimited\"), between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded infinities.\nLeibniz, one of the co-inventors of infinitesimal calculus, speculated widely about infinite numbers and their use in mathematics. To Leibniz, both infinitesimals and infinite quantities were ideal entities, not of the same nature as appreciable quantities, but enjoying the same properties in accordance with the Law of Continuity.\nIn real analysis, the symbol formula_1, called \"infinity\", is used to denote an unbounded limit. The notation formula_6 means that x grows without bound, and formula_7 means that x decreases without bound.

Points labeled formula_17 and formula_18 can be added to the topological space of the real numbers, producing the two-point compactification of the real numbers. Adding algebraic properties to this gives us the extended real numbers. We can also treat formula_17 and formula_18 as the same, leading to the one-point compactification of the real numbers, which is the real projective line.

In Greek philosophy, for example in Anaximander, 'the Boundless' is the origin of all that is. He took the beginning or first principle to be an endless, unlimited primordial mass (\u1f04\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \"apeiron\"). The Jain metaphysics and mathematics were the first to define and delineate different \"types\" of infinities. The work of the mathematician Georg Cantor first placed infinity into a coherent mathematical framework. Keenly aware of his departure from traditional wisdom, Cantor also presented a comprehensive historical and philosophical discussion of infinity. In Judeo-Christian theology, for example in the work of Duns Scotus, the infinite nature of God invokes a sense of being without constraint, rather than a sense of being unlimited in quantity. In ethics infinity plays an important role in designating that which cannot be defined or reduced to knowledge or power.\n\nAn early engagement with the idea of infinity was made by Anaximander who considered infinity to be a foundational and primitive basis of reality. Anaximander was the first in the Greek philosophical tradition to propose that the universe was infinite.\n\nAnaxagoras (500\u2013428 BCE) was of the opinion that matter of the universe had an innate capacity for infinite division.\n\nA group of thinkers of ancient Greece (later identified as the Atomists) all similarly considered matter to be made of an infinite number of structures as considered by imagining dividing or separating matter from itself an infinite number of times.\n\nAristotle, alive for the period 384\u2013322 BCE, is credited with being the root of a field of thought, in his influence of succeeding thinking for a period spanning more than one subsequent millennium, by his rejection of the idea of actual infinity.\nIn Book 3 of the work entitled Physics, written by Aristotle, Aristotle deals with the concept of infinity in terms of his notion of actuality and of potentiality.\nThis is often called potential infinity; however, there are two ideas mixed up with this. One is that it is always possible to find a number of things that surpasses any given number, even if there are not actually such things. The other is that we may quantify over infinite sets without restriction. For example, formula_1, which reads, \"for any integer n, there exists an integer m  n such that P(m)\". The second view is found in a clearer form by medieval writers such as William of Ockham:\nThe parts are actually there, in some sense. However, on this view, no infinite magnitude can have a number, for whatever number we can imagine, there is always a larger one: \"There are not so many (in number) that there are no more.\"\nAristotle's views on the continuum foreshadow some topological aspects of modern mathematical theories of the continuum. Aristotle's emphasis on the connectedness of the continuum may have inspired\u2014in different ways\u2014modern philosophers and mathematicians such as Charles Sanders Peirce, Cantor, and LEJ Brouwer.\nAmong the scholastics, Aquinas also argued against the idea that infinity could be in any sense complete or a totality.\nAristotle deals with infinity in the context of the prime mover, in Book 7 of the same work, the reasoning of which was later studied and commented on by Simplicius.\n\nThe Jain upanga \u0101gama Surya Prajnapti (c. 400 BC) classifies all numbers into three sets: enumerable, innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders:\nBULLET::::- Enumerable: lowest, intermediate and highest\nBULLET::::- Innumerable: nearly innumerable, truly innumerable and innumerably innumerable\nBULLET::::- Infinite: nearly infinite, truly infinite, infinitely infinite\nThe Jains were the first to discard the idea that all infinities were the same or equal. They recognized different types of infinities: infinite in length (one dimension), infinite in area (two dimensions), infinite in volume (three dimensions), and infinite perpetually (infinite number of dimensions).\nAccording to Singh (1987), Joseph (2000) and Agrawal (2000), the highest enumerable number \"N\" of the Jains corresponds to the modern concept of aleph-null formula_2 (the cardinal number of the infinite set of integers 1, 2, ...), the smallest cardinal transfinite number. The Jains also defined a whole system of infinite cardinal numbers, of which the highest enumerable number \"N\" is the smallest.\nIn the Jaina work on the theory of sets, two basic types of infinite numbers are distinguished. On both physical and ontological grounds, a distinction was made between (\"countless, innumerable\") and \"ananta\" (\"endless, unlimited\"), between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded infinities.\n\nGalileo Galilei (February 1564 - January 1642 ) discussed the example of comparing the square numbers {1, 4, 9, 16, ...} with the natural numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} as follows:\nIt appeared by this reasoning as though a \"set\" (Galileo did not use the terminology) which is naturally smaller than the \"set\" of which it is a part (since it does not contain all the members) is in some sense the same \"size\". Galileo found no way around this problem:\nThe idea that size can be measured by one-to-one correspondence is today known as Hume's principle, although Hume, like Galileo, believed the principle could not be applied to the infinite. The same concept, applied by Georg Cantor, is used in relation to infinite sets."], "wikipedia-185663": ["Such a division can be formally expressed as where \"a\" is the dividend (numerator). In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has no meaning, as there is no number which, when multiplied by 0, gives \"a\" (assuming \"a\" \u2260 0), and so division by zero is undefined. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the expression is also undefined; when it is the form of a limit, it is an indeterminate form.\n\nThere are mathematical structures in which is defined for some \"a\" such as in the Riemann sphere and the projectively extended real line; however, such structures cannot satisfy every ordinary rule of arithmetic (the field axioms).\n\nAnother way of looking at division by zero is that division can always be checked using multiplication. Considering the example above, setting \"x\" = , if \"x\" equals ten divided by zero, then \"x\" times zero equals ten, but there is no \"x\" that, when multiplied by zero, gives ten (or any number other than zero). If instead of \"x\" = , \"x\" = , then every \"x\" satisfies the question 'what number \"x\", multiplied by zero, gives zero?'\n\nIn keeping with this change of viewpoint, the question, \"Why can't we divide by zero?\", becomes \"Why can't a rational number have a zero denominator?\". Answering this revised question precisely requires close examination of the definition of rational numbers.\n\nIt follows from the properties of the number system we are using (that is, integers, rationals, reals, etc.), if then the equation is equivalent to . Assuming that is a number , then it must be that . However, the single number would then have to be determined by the equation , but every number satisfies this equation, so we cannot assign a numerical value to .\n\nIn general, a single value can't be assigned to a fraction where the denominator is 0 so the value remains undefined.\n\nA compelling reason for not allowing division by zero is that, if it were allowed, many absurd results (i.e., fallacies) would arise. When working with numerical quantities it is easy to determine when an illegal attempt to divide by zero is being made. For example, consider the following computation.\n\nWith the assumptions:\nthe following is true:\nDividing both sides by zero gives:\nSimplified, this yields:\nThe fallacy here is the assumption that dividing by 0 is a legitimate operation with the same properties as dividing by any other number."], "wikipedia-20029977": ["Georg Cantor considered the infinite set of whole numbers 1, 2, 3 ... \u221e which he compared with the smaller set of numbers 10, 20, 30 ... \u221e.

Yet Cantor was still able to pair each such fraction to a whole number 1 - /; 2 - /; 3 - / ... etc. through to \u221e; i.e. the infinities of both fractions and whole numbers were shown to have the same size.\nBut when the set of all infinite decimal numbers was considered, Cantor was able to prove that this produced a bigger infinity. This was because, no matter how one tried to construct such a list, Cantor was able to provide a new decimal number that was missing from that list. Thus he showed that there were different infinities, some bigger than others.\nHowever, there was a problem that Cantor was unable to solve: Is there an infinity sitting between the smaller infinity of all the fractions and the larger infinity of the decimals?

In 1655 John Wallis first used the notation formula_1 for such a number in his \"De sectionibus conicis\" and exploited it in area calculations by dividing the region into infinitesimal strips of width on the order of formula_3 But in \"Arithmetica infinitorum\" (1655 also) he indicates infinite series, infinite products and infinite continued fractions by writing down a few terms or factors and then appending \"&c.\" For example, \"1, 6, 12, 18, 24, &c.\"\nIn 1699 Isaac Newton wrote about equations with an infinite number of terms in his work \"De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas\".\nSection::::Mathematics.\nHermann Weyl opened a mathematico-philosophic address given in 1930 with:\nSection::::Mathematics.:Infinity symbol.\nThe infinity symbol formula_1 (sometimes called the lemniscate) is a mathematical symbol representing the concept of infinity. The symbol is encoded in Unicode at and in LaTeX as codice_1.\nIt was introduced in 1655 by John Wallis, and, since its introduction, has also been used outside mathematics in modern mysticism and literary symbology.\nSection::::Mathematics.:Calculus.\nLeibniz, one of the co-inventors of infinitesimal calculus, speculated widely about infinite numbers and their use in mathematics.

Points labeled formula_17 and formula_18 can be added to the topological space of the real numbers, producing the two-point compactification of the real numbers. Adding algebraic properties to this gives us the extended real numbers. We can also treat formula_17 and formula_18 as the same, leading to the one-point compactification of the real numbers, which is the real projective line. Projective geometry also refers to a line at infinity in plane geometry, a plane at infinity in three-dimensional space, and a hyperplane at infinity for general dimensions, each consisting of points at infinity.\nSection::::Mathematics.:Calculus.:Complex analysis.\nIn complex analysis the symbol formula_1, called \"infinity\", denotes an unsigned infinite limit. formula_6 means that the magnitude\u00a0formula_23 of\u00a0\"x\" grows beyond any assigned value. A point labeled formula_1 can be added to the complex plane as a topological space giving the one-point compactification of the complex plane. When this is done, the resulting space is a one-dimensional complex manifold, or Riemann surface, called the extended complex plane or the Riemann sphere. Arithmetic operations similar to those given above for the extended real numbers can also be defined, though there is no distinction in the signs (therefore one exception is that infinity cannot be added to itself). On the other hand, this kind of infinity enables division by zero, namely formula_25 for any nonzero complex number\u00a0\"z\". In this context it is often useful to consider meromorphic functions as maps into the Riemann sphere taking the value of formula_1 at the poles. The domain of a complex-valued function may be extended to include the point at infinity as well. One important example of such functions is the group of M\u00f6bius transformations.\nSection::::Mathematics.:Nonstandard analysis.\nThe original formulation of infinitesimal calculus by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz used infinitesimal quantities. In the twentieth century, it was shown that this treatment could be put on a rigorous footing through various logical systems, including smooth infinitesimal analysis and nonstandard analysis. In the latter, infinitesimals are invertible, and their inverses are infinite numbers. The infinities in this sense are part of a hyperreal field; there is no equivalence between them as with the Cantorian transfinites. For example, if\u00a0H is an infinite number, then H\u00a0+\u00a0H\u00a0= 2H and H\u00a0+\u00a01 are distinct infinite numbers. This approach to non-standard calculus is fully developed in .\nSection::::Mathematics.:Set theory.\nA different form of \"infinity\" are the ordinal and cardinal infinities of set theory. Georg Cantor developed a system of transfinite numbers, in which the first transfinite cardinal is aleph-null (\u2135), the cardinality of the set of natural numbers. This modern mathematical conception of the quantitative infinite developed in the late nineteenth century from work by Cantor, Gottlob Frege, Richard Dedekind and others, using the idea of collections, or sets.\nDedekind's approach was essentially to adopt the idea of one-to-one correspondence as a standard for comparing the size of sets, and to reject the view of Galileo (which derived from Euclid) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part (however, see Galileo's paradox where he concludes that positive integers which are squares and all positive integers are the same size). An infinite set can simply be defined as one having the same size as at least one of"], "wikipedia-243316": ["If the homogeneous coordinates of a point are multiplied by a non-zero scalar then the resulting coordinates represent the same point. Since homogeneous coordinates are also given to points at infinity, the number of coordinates required to allow this extension is one more than the dimension of the projective space being considered. For example, two homogeneous coordinates are required to specify a point on the projective line and three homogeneous coordinates are required to specify a point in the projective plane.\n\nThe real projective plane can be thought of as the Euclidean plane with additional points added, which are called points at infinity, and are considered to lie on a new line, the line at infinity. There is a point at infinity corresponding to each direction (numerically given by the slope of a line), informally defined as the limit of a point that moves in that direction away from the origin. Parallel lines in the Euclidean plane are said to intersect at a point at infinity corresponding to their common direction. Given a point on the Euclidean plane, for any non-zero real number \"Z\", the triple is called a \"set of homogeneous coordinates\" for the point. By this definition, multiplying the three homogeneous coordinates by a common, non-zero factor gives a new set of homogeneous coordinates for the same point. In particular, is such a system of homogeneous coordinates for the point .\n\nFor example, the Cartesian point can be represented in homogeneous coordinates as or . The original Cartesian coordinates are recovered by dividing the first two positions by the third. Thus unlike Cartesian coordinates, a single point can be represented by infinitely many homogeneous coordinates.\n\nThe equation of a line through the origin may be written where \"n\" and \"m\" are not both 0. In parametric form this can be written . Let \"Z\" = 1/\"t\", so the coordinates of a point on the line may be written . In homogeneous coordinates this becomes . In the limit, as \"t\" approaches infinity, in other words, as the point moves away from the origin, \"Z\" approaches 0 and the homogeneous coordinates of the point become . Thus we define as the homogeneous coordinates of the point at infinity corresponding to the direction of the line . As any line of the Euclidean plane is parallel to a line passing through the origin, and since parallel lines have the same point at infinity, the infinite point on every line of the Euclidean plane has been given homogeneous coordinates.\n\nTo summarize:\nBULLET::::- Any point in the projective plane is represented by a triple , called the homogeneous coordinates or projective coordinates of the point, where \"X\", \"Y\" and \"Z\" are not all 0.\nBULLET::::- The point represented by a given set of homogeneous coordinates is unchanged if the coordinates are multiplied by a common factor.\nBULLET::::- Conversely, two sets of homogeneous coordinates represent the same point if and only if one is obtained from the other by multiplying all the coordinates by the same non-zero constant.\nBULLET::::- When \"Z\" is not 0 the point represented is the point in the Euclidean plane.\nBULLET::::- When \"Z\" is 0 the point represented is a point at infinity."], "wikipedia-11930843": ["In philosophy and theology, infinity is explored in articles under headings such as the Ultimate, the Absolute, God, and Zeno's paradoxes.

This was because, no matter how one tried to construct such a list, Cantor was able to provide a new decimal number that was missing from that list. Thus he showed that there were different infinities, some bigger than others.\n\nHowever, there was a problem that Cantor was unable to solve: Is there an infinity sitting between the smaller infinity of all the fractions and the larger infinity of the decimals?

For example, regarding 0^0 as an empty product assigns it the value 1, even when 0=0. Alternatively, the combinatorial interpretation of 0^0 is the number of empty tuples of elements from a set with 0 elements; there is exactly one empty tuple, even if 0=0. Equivalently, the set-theoretic interpretation of 0^0 is the number of functions from the empty set to the empty set; there is exactly one such function, the empty function.\n\nSection::::Polynomials and power series.\nLikewise, when working with polynomials, it is often necessary to assign the value 1 to 0^0. A polynomial is an expression of the form formula_1 where x is an indeterminate, and the coefficients formula_2 are real numbers (or, more generally, elements of some ring). The set of all real polynomials in x is denoted by formula_3. Polynomials are added termwise, and multiplied by the applying the usual rules for exponents in the indeterminate (see Cauchy product). With these algebraic rules for manipulation, polynomials form a polynomial ring. The polynomial formula_4 is the identity element of the polynomial ring, meaning that it is the (unique) element such that the product of formula_4 with any polynomial formula_6 is just formula_6. Polynomials can be evaluated by specializing the indeterminate to be a real number. More precisely, for any given real number formula_8 there is a unique unital ring homomorphism formula_9 such that formula_10. This is called the \"evaluation homomorphism\". Because it is a unital homomorphism, we have formula_11 That is, formula_12=1 for all specializations of x to a real number (including zero). This perspective is significant for many polynomial identities appearing in combinatorics. For example, the binomial theorem formula_13 is not valid for x=0 unless 0^0=1. Similarly, rings of power series require 0^0=1 to be true for all specializations of x. Thus identities like formula_15 and formula_16 are only true as functional identities (including at x=0) if 0^0=1.\n\nSection::::Continuous exponents.\nLimits involving algebraic operations can often be evaluated by replacing subexpressions by their limits; if the resulting expression does not determine the original limit, the expression is known as an indeterminate form. In fact, when 0^0 and 0^0 are real-valued functions both approaching 0 (as x approaches a real number or infinity), with 0^0, the function need not approach 1; depending on 0^0 and 0^0, the limit of 0^0 can be any non-negative real number or 0^0, or it can diverge. For example, the functions below are of the form 0^0 with x=0 (a one-sided limit), but the limits are different:\nThus, the two-variable function 0^0, though continuous on the set 0^0 cannot be extended to a continuous function on formula_19, no matter how one chooses to define 0^0. However, under certain conditions, such as when 0^0 and 0^0 are both analytic functions and 0^0 is positive on the open interval for some positive x, the limit 0^0 approaching 0 from the right is always 0^0.\n\nSection::::History of differing points of view.\nThe debate over the definition of 0^0 has been going on at least since the early 19th century. At that time, most mathematicians agreed that 0^0=1, until in 1821 Cauchy listed 0^0 along with expressions like formula_23 in a table of indeterminate forms. In the 1830s Libri published an unconvincing argument for 0^0=1, and M\u00f6bius sided with him, erroneously claiming that formula_25=1 whenever formula_26.

For a structured tutorial, additional resources like math textbooks or educational websites might be more suitable, but Wikipedia can partially answer the query.", "wikipedia-7379355": ["The first step is to draw equal sized vertical and horizontal axes of a graph. The horizontal axis will be for the mole fraction (denoted by x) of the lower-boiling feed component in the liquid phase. The vertical axis will be for the mole fraction (denoted by y) of the lower-boiling feed component in the vapor phase.\nThe next step is to draw a straight line from the origin of the graph to the point where x and y both equal 1.0, which is the x = y line in Figure 1. This 45 degree line is used simply as a graphical aid for drawing the remaining lines. Then draw the equilibrium line using the VLE data points of the lower boiling component, representing the equilibrium vapor phase compositions for each value of liquid phase composition. Also draw vertical lines from the horizontal axis up to the x = y line for the feed and for the desired compositions of the top distillate product and the corresponding bottoms product (shown in red in Figure 1).\nThe next step is to draw the operating line for the rectifying section (the section above the feed inlet) of the distillation column, (shown in green in Figure 1). Starting at the intersection of the distillate composition line and the x = y line, draw the rectifying operating line at a downward slope (\u0394y/\u0394x) of L / (D + L) where L is the molar flow rate of reflux and D is the molar flow rate of the distillate product. For example, in Figure 1, assuming the molar flow rate of the reflux L is 1000 moles per hour and the molar flow rate of the distillate D is 590 moles per hour, then the downward slope of the rectifying operating line is 1000 / (590 + 1000) = 0.63 which means that the y-coordinate of any point on the line decreases 0.63 units for each unit that the x-coordinate decreases.\nThe next step is to draw the blue q-line (seen in Figure 1) from the x = y line so that it intersects the rectifying operating line.\nThe parameter q is the mole fraction of liquid in the feed and the slope of the q-line is q / (q \u2013 1). For example, if the feed is a saturated liquid it has no vapor, thus q = 1 and the slope of the q-line is infinite which means the line is vertical. As another example, if the feed is all saturated vapor, q = 0 and the slope of the q-line is 0 which means that the line is horizontal.\nSome example q-line slopes are presented in Figure 2. As can be seen now, the typical McCabe-Thiele diagram in Figure 1 uses a q-line representing a partially vaporized feed.\nNext, as shown in Figure 1, draw the purple operating line for the stripping section of the distillation column (i.e., the section below the feed inlet). Starting at the intersection of the red bottoms composition line and the x = y line, draw the stripping section operating line up to the point where the blue q-line intersects the green operating line of the rectifying section operating line.\nFinally, as exemplified in Figure 1, draw the steps between operating lines and the equilibrium line and then count them. Those steps represent the theoretical plates (or equilibrium stages). The required number of theoretical plates is 6 for the binary distillation depicted in Figure 1."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-2497698": 1, "wikipedia-325813": 1, "wikipedia-29638": 1, "wikipedia-5628201": 1, "wikipedia-40153860": 1, "wikipedia-7379355": 1, "wikipedia-151641": 1, "wikipedia-18116059": 1, "wikipedia-155562": 1, "wikipedia-1869705": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-2497698": 1, "wikipedia-325813": 1, "wikipedia-29638": 1, "wikipedia-5628201": 1, "wikipedia-40153860": 1, "wikipedia-7379355": 2, "wikipedia-151641": 1, "wikipedia-18116059": 1, "wikipedia-155562": 1, "wikipedia-1869705": 1}}}

These are named after Jean-Robert Argand (1768\u20131822), although they were first described by Norwegian-Danish land surveyor and mathematician Caspar Wessel (1745\u20131818). Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the positions of the poles and zeroes of a function in the complex plane.\nThe concept of the complex plane allows a geometric interpretation of complex numbers. Under addition, they add like vectors. The multiplication of two complex numbers can be expressed most easily in polar coordinates \u2014 the magnitude or \"modulus\" of the product is the product of the two absolute values, or moduli, and the angle or \"argument\" of the product is the sum of the two angles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 acts as a rotation.\n\nCommutative diagrams play the role in category theory that equations play in algebra.\n\nA Venn diagram is a representation of mathematical sets: a mathematical diagram representing sets as circles, with their relationships to each other expressed through their overlapping positions, so that all possible relationships between the sets are shown.\nThe Venn diagram is constructed with a collection of simple closed curves drawn in the plane. The principle of these diagrams is that classes be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is not null."], "wikipedia-61701": ["Venn diagrams are used to teach elementary set theory, as well as illustrate simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, linguistics, and computer science. The points inside a curve labelled \"S\" represent elements of the set \"S\", while points outside the boundary represent elements not in the set \"S\". This lends to easily read visualizations; for example, the set of all elements that are members of both sets \"S\" and \"T\", \"S\"\u00a0\u2229\u00a0\"T\", is represented visually by the area of overlap of the regions \"S\" and \"T\". In Venn diagrams the curves are overlapped in every possible way, showing all possible relations between the sets.

The form of Bernoulli\u2019s equation discussed here assumes the flow is incompressible and steady. The three energy components in Bernoulli's equation are elevation, pressure and velocity. However, since with open channel flow, the water surface is open to the atmosphere, the pressure term between two points has the same value and is therefore ignored. Thus, if the specific energy and the velocity of the flow in the channel are known, the depth of flow can be determined. This relationship can be used to calculate changes in depth upstream or downstream of changes in the channel such as steps, constrictions, or control structures. It is also the fundamental relationship used in the standard step method to calculate how the depth of a flow changes over a reach from the energy gained or lost due to the slope of the channel.\n\nFor a given discharge, the specific energy can be calculated for various flow depths and plotted on an E\u2013y diagram. A typical E\u2013y diagram is shown below.\n\nThree different q values are plotted on the specific energy diagram above. The unit discharges increase from left to right, meaning that q < q < q. There is a distinct asymptotic relationship as the top part of the curve approaches the E = y line and the bottom part of the curve tends toward the x-axis. Also shown are the critical energy or minimum energy, E and the corresponding critical depth value, y. The values shown are for the q discharge only, but unique critical values exist for any discharge.\n\nPhysically, subcritical flow is deep and the velocities are slow. This means subcritical flow has high potential energy and low kinetic energy. Supercritical flow on the other hand tends to be shallow and the velocities are fast. Supercritical flow has low potential energy and high kinetic energy.\n\nIf we refer back to the E\u2013y diagram, it is seen that a line passes through the critical value on each successive discharge curve. This line corresponds to formula_13.\n\nDepth values on the E\u2013y curve greater than the critical depth correspond to subcritical flow depths. Likewise, values less than the critical depth correspond to supercritical flow depths."], "wikipedia-25268": ["The key components of Feynman's presentation of QED are three basic actions.\nThese actions are represented in the form of visual shorthand by the three basic elements of Feynman diagrams: a wavy line for the photon, a straight line for the electron and a junction of two straight lines and a wavy one for a vertex representing emission or absorption of a photon by an electron. These can all be seen in the adjacent diagram.\n\nAs well as the visual shorthand for the actions Feynman introduces another kind of shorthand for the numerical quantities called probability amplitudes. The probability is the square of the absolute value of total probability amplitude, formula_1. If a photon moves from one place and time formula_2 to another place and time formula_3, the associated quantity is written in Feynman's shorthand as formula_4. The similar quantity for an electron moving from formula_5 to formula_6 is written formula_7. The quantity that tells us about the probability amplitude for the emission or absorption of a photon he calls \"j\". This is related to, but not the same as, the measured electron charge \"e\".\n\nQED is based on the assumption that complex interactions of many electrons and photons can be represented by fitting together a suitable collection of the above three building blocks and then using the probability amplitudes to calculate the probability of any such complex interaction. It turns out that the basic idea of QED can be communicated while assuming that the square of the total of the probability amplitudes mentioned above (\"P\"(\"A\" to \"B\"), \"E\"(\"C\" to \"D\") and \"j\") acts just like our everyday probability (a simplification made in Feynman's book).

Given a commutative diagram, a proof by diagram chasing involves the formal use of the properties of the diagram, such as injective or surjective maps, or exact sequences.
