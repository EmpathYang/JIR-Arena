Analyze this description of a presentation for information needs. I will provide you with a summary of the presentation so far and a segment from the presentation. 

Categorize each information need into one of the following categories:

1. Visual References (graphs, images, diagrams, etc.)  
2. Technical Terms (jargon, acronyms, formulas, definitions)  
3. Data & Sources (uncited stats, vague claims like "studies show...")  
4. Processes/Methods (unexplained workflows/algorithms)  
5. External Content (papers, tools, historical references without context)  
6. Ambiguous Language (vague terms like "many" or "significant")  
7. Missing Context (assumed prior knowledge, undefined goals)  
8. Instructions/Actions (unclear steps, implied tasks)  
9. Code/Formulas (unexplained pseudocode/equations)  
10. Future Work (vague next steps, unresolved questions)  
11. Conceptual Understanding (concepts, ideas)

I need an exhaustinve list of information needs. Each sentence can need multiple information needs.
Return a JSON list with `type`, `subtype`, and `reason` for each need.  Ensure the output is strictly JSON-compliant
