To address the second problem (of how to involve related words), we need to introduce weights on words. This is what allows us to distinguish subtle differences in topics, and to introduce semantically related words in a quantitative manner. Finally, to solve the problem of word ambiguity, we need to `split` ambiguous words to allow them to be used to (potentially) describe multiple topics. It turns out that all these can be elegantly achieved by using a probability distribution over words (\\ie, a unigram language model) to denote a topic as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:topic-as-dist}.

Natural language content analysis is the foundation of text mining. So we're going to first talk about this. And in particular, natural language processing with a factor how we can present text data. And this determines what algorithms can be used to analyze and mine text data. We're going to take a look at the basic concepts in natural language first. And I'm going to explain these concepts using a similar example that you've all seen here. A dog is chasing a boy on the playground. Now this is a very simple sentence. When we read such a sentence we don't have to think about it to get the meaning of it. But when a computer has to understand the sentence, the computer has to go through several steps. First, the computer needs to know what are the words, how to segment the words in English. And this is very easy, we can just look at the space. And then the computer will need the know the categories of these words, syntactical categories. So for example, dog is a noun, chasing's a verb, boy is another noun etc. And this is called a Lexical analysis. In particular, tagging these words with these syntactic categories is called a part-of-speech tagging. After that the computer also needs to figure out the relationship between these words. So a and dog would form a noun phrase. On the playground would be a prepositional phrase, etc. And there is certain way for them to be connected together in order for them to create meaning. Some other combinations may not make sense. And this is called syntactical parsing, or syntactical analysis, parsing of a natural language sentence. The outcome is a parse tree that you are seeing here. That tells us the structure of the sentence, so that we know how we can interpret this sentence. But this is not semantics yet. So in order to get the meaning we would have to map these phrases and these structures into some real world antithesis that we have in our mind. So dog is a concept that we know, and boy is a concept that we know. So connecting these phrases that we know is understanding. Now for a computer, would have to formally represent these entities by using symbols. So dog, d1 means d1 is a dog. Boy, b1 means b1 refers to a boy etc. And also represents the chasing action as a predicate. So, chasing is a predicate here with three arguments, d1, b1, and p1. Which is playground. So this formal rendition of the semantics of this sentence. Once we reach that level of understanding, we might also make inferences. For example, if we assume there's a rule that says if someone's being chased then the person can get scared, then we can infer this boy might be scared. This is the inferred meaning, based on additional knowledge. And finally, we might even further infer what this sentence is requesting, or why the person who say it in a sentence, is saying the sentence. And so, this has to do with purpose of saying the sentence. This is called speech act analysis or pragmatic analysis. Which first to the use of language. So, in this case a person saying this may be reminding another person to bring back the dog. So this means when saying a sentence, the person actually takes an action. So the action here is to make a request. Now, this slide clearly shows that in order to really understand a sentence there are a lot of things that a computer has to do. Now, in general it's very hard for a computer will do everything, especially if you would want it to do everything correctly. This is very difficult. Now, the main reason why natural language processing is very difficult, it's because it's designed it will make human communications efficient. As a result, for example, with only a lot of common sense knowledge. Because we assume all of us have this knowledge, there's no need to encode this knowledge. That makes communication efficient. We also keep a lot of ambiguities, like, ambiguities of words. And this is again, because we assume we have the ability to disambiguate the word.

Such metrics are often split into kinds: online metrics look at users' interactions with the search system, while offline metrics measure relevance, in other words how likely each result, or search engine results page (SERP) page as a whole, is to meet the information needs of the user.\n\nSection::::Online metrics.\nOnline metrics are generally created from search logs. The metrics are often used to determine the success of an A/B test.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Session abandonment rate.\nSession abandonment rate is a ratio of search sessions which do not result in a click.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Click-through rate.\nClick-through rate (CTR) is the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. It is commonly used to measure the success of an online advertising campaign for a particular website as well as the effectiveness of email campaigns.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Session success rate.\nSession success rate measures the ratio of user sessions that lead to a success. Defining \"success\" is often dependent on context, but for search a successful result is often measured using dwell time as a primary factor along with secondary user interaction, for instance, the user copying the result URL is considered a successful result, as is copy/pasting from the snippet.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Zero result rate.\n\"Zero result rate\" (\"ZRR\") is the ratio of SERPs which returned with zero results. The metric either indicates a recall issue, or that the information being searched for is not in the index.\n\nSection::::Offline metrics.\nOffline metrics are generally created from relevance judgment sessions where the judges score the quality of the search results. Both binary (relevant/non-relevant) and multi-level (e.g., relevance from 0 to 5) scales can be used to score each document returned in response to a query. In practice, queries may be ill-posed, and there may be different shades of relevance. For instance, there is ambiguity in the query \"mars\": the judge does not know if the user is searching for the planet Mars, the Mars chocolate bar, or the singer Bruno Mars.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Precision.\nPrecision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are relevant to the user's information need.\nIn binary classification, precision is analogous to positive predictive value. Precision takes all retrieved documents into account. It can also be evaluated at a given cut-off rank, considering only the topmost results returned by the system. This measure is called \"precision at n\" or \"P@n\".\nNote that the meaning and usage of \"precision\" in the field of information retrieval differs from the definition of accuracy and precision within other branches of science and statistics.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Recall.\nRecall is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved.\nIn binary classification, recall is often called sensitivity. So it can be looked at as \"the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query\".\nIt is trivial to achieve recall of 100% by returning all documents in response to any query. Therefore, recall alone is not enough but one needs to measure the number of non-relevant documents also, for example by computing the precision.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Fall-out.\nThe proportion of non-relevant documents that are retrieved, out of all non-relevant documents available:\nIn binary classification, fall-out is closely related to specificity and is equal to formula_9. It can be looked at as \"the probability that a non-relevant document is retrieved by the query\".\nIt is trivial to achieve fall-out of 0% by returning zero documents in response to any query.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:F-score / F-measure.\nThe weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, the traditional F-measure or balanced F-score is:\nThis is also known as the formula_11 measure, because recall and precision are evenly weighted.\nThe general formula for non-negative real formula_12 is:\nTwo other commonly used F measures are the formula_14 measure, which weights recall twice as much as precision, and the formula_15 measure, which weights precision twice as much as recall.\nThe F-measure was derived by van Rijsbergen (1979) so that formula_16 \"measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches formula_12 times as much importance to recall as precision\". It is based on van Rijsbergen's effectiveness measure formula_18. Their relationship is:\nF-measure can be a better single metric when compared to precision and recall; both precision and recall give different information that can complement each other when combined. If one of them excels more than the other, F-measure will reflect it.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Average precision.\nPrecision and recall are single-value metrics based on the whole list of documents returned by the system. For systems that return a ranked sequence of documents, it is desirable to also consider the order in which the returned documents are presented. By computing a precision and recall at every position in the ranked sequence of documents, one can plot a precision-recall curve, plotting precision formula_21 as a function of recall formula_22. Average precision computes the average value of formula_21 over the interval from formula_24 to formula_25:\nThat is the area under the precision-recall curve.\nThis integral is in practice replaced with a finite sum over every position in the ranked sequence of documents:\nwhere formula_28 is the rank in the sequence of retrieved documents, formula_29 is the number of retrieved documents, formula_30 is the precision at cut-off formula_28 in the list, and formula_32 is the change in recall from items formula_33 to formula_28.\nThis finite sum is equivalent to:\nwhere formula_36 is an indicator function equaling 1 if the item at rank formula_28 is a relevant document, zero otherwise. Note that the average is over all relevant documents and the relevant documents not retrieved get a precision score of zero.\nSome authors choose to interpolate the formula_21 function to reduce the impact of \"wiggles\" in the curve. For example, the PASCAL Visual Object Classes challenge (a benchmark for computer vision object detection) until 2010 computed the average precision by averaging the precision over a set of evenly spaced recall levels {0, 0.1, 0.2, ... 1.0}:\nwhere formula_40 is an interpolated precision that takes the maximum precision over all recalls greater than formula_22:\nAn alternative is to derive an analytical formula_21 function by assuming a particular parametric distribution for the underlying decision values. For example, a \"binormal precision-recall curve\" can be obtained by assuming decision values in both classes to follow a Gaussian distribution.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Precision at K.\nFor modern (web-scale) information retrieval, recall is no longer a meaningful metric, as many queries have thousands of relevant documents, and few users will be interested in reading all of them. Precision at k documents (P@k) is still a useful metric (e.g., P@10 or \"Precision at 10\" corresponds to the number of relevant results on the first search results page), but fails to take into account the positions of the relevant documents among the top k. Another shortcoming is that on a query with fewer relevant results than k, even a perfect system will have a score less than 1. It is easier to score manually since only the top k results need to be examined to determine if they are relevant or not.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:R-Precision.\nR-precision requires knowing all documents that are relevant to a query. The number of relevant documents, formula_44, is used as the cutoff for calculation, and this varies from query to query. For example, if there are 15 documents relevant to \"red\" in a corpus (R=15), R-precision for \"red\" looks at the top 15 documents returned, counts the number that are relevant formula_22 turns that into a relevancy fraction: formula_46.\nPrecision is equal to recall at the R-th position.\nEmpirically, this measure is often highly correlated to mean average precision.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Mean average precision.\nMean average precision for a set of queries is the mean of the average precision scores for each query.\nwhere \"Q\" is the number of queries.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Discounted cumulative gain.\nDCG uses a graded relevance scale of documents from the result set to evaluate the usefulness, or gain, of a document based on its position in the result list. The premise of DCG is that highly relevant documents appearing lower in a search result list should be penalized as the graded relevance value is reduced logarithmically proportional to the position of the result.\nThe DCG accumulated at a particular rank position formula_48 is defined as:"], "wikipedia-619350": ["The five-tiered approach is offered as a conceptual framework for matching evaluations more precisely to the characteristics of the programs themselves, and to the particular resources and constraints inherent in each evaluation context.

We are also usually concerned about accuracy, which is defined as the number of correct categorization decisions made by the system divided by the total number of categorization decisions made by the system. Since the accuracy measure does not distinguish different types of categorization errors, it is not appropriate to use it on a data set that has skewed distributions of instances in different classes. For example, in a binary categorization problem, if one category is much more popular than the other, than a trivial baseline that simply puts all instances in the category would have a pretty high categorization accuracy. To more appropriately evaluate such a categorization task, we can examine the categorization performance for each category. For example, we may treat the categorization results for each category as ``retrieval'' results for a query corresponding to the category and apply typical measures used in retrieval such as precision, recall and F measure to quantify the performance in a per-category manner. Readers can find more discussion about this in the reference \\cite{Yang:99}.\nAnother evaluation paradigm is $n$-fold \\textbf{cross validation}. This splits the corpus into $n$ partitions. In $n$ rounds, one partition is selected as the testing set and the remaining $n-1$ are used for training. The final accuracy, $F_1$ score, or any other evaluation metric is then averaged over the $n$ folds. The variance in scores between the folds can be a hint at the overfitting potential of your algorithm. If the variance is high, it means that the accuracies are not very similar between folds. Having one fold with a very high accuracy suggests that your learning algorithm may have overfit during that training stage; when using that trained algorithm on a separate corpus, it's likely that the accuracy would be very low since it modeled noise or other uninformative features from that particular split (\\ie, it overfit). Another important concept is \\textbf{baseline accuracy}. This represents the minimum score to ``beat'' when using your classifier. Say there are 3000 documents consisting of three classes, each with 1000 documents. In this case, random guessing would give you about $33\\%$ accuracy, since you'd be correct approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the time. Your classifier would have to do better than $33\\%$ accuracy in order to make it useful! In another example, consider the 3000 documents and three classes, but with an uneven class distribution: one class has 2000 documents and the other two classes have 500 each. In this case, the baseline accuracy is $66\\%$, since picking the majority class label will result in correct predictions $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the time. Thus, it's important to take class imbalances into consideration when evaluating a classifier. A \\textbf{confusion matrix} is a way to examine a classifier's performance at a per-label level. Consider Figure~\\ref{fig:conf-matrix}, the output from running \\meta~on a three-class classification problem to determine the native language of the author of English text. Each $(row, column)$ index in the table shows the fraction of times that $row$ was classified as $column$. Therefore, the rows all sum to one.

It is commonly used to measure the success of an online advertising campaign for a particular website as well as the effectiveness of email campaigns.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Session success rate.\nSession success rate measures the ratio of user sessions that lead to a success. Defining \"success\" is often dependent on context, but for search a successful result is often measured using dwell time as a primary factor along with secondary user interaction, for instance, the user copying the result URL is considered a successful result, as is copy/pasting from the snippet.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Zero result rate.\n\"Zero result rate\" (\"ZRR\") is the ratio of SERPs which returned with zero results. The metric either indicates a recall issue, or that the information being searched for is not in the index.\nSection::::Offline metrics.\nOffline metrics are generally created from relevance judgment sessions where the judges score the quality of the search results. Both binary (relevant/non-relevant) and multi-level (e.g., relevance from 0 to 5) scales can be used to score each document returned in response to a query. In practice, queries may be ill-posed, and there may be different shades of relevance.

Precision takes all retrieved documents into account. It can also be evaluated at a given cut-off rank, considering only the topmost results returned by the system. This measure is called \"precision at n\" or \"P@n\".\nNote that the meaning and usage of \"precision\" in the field of information retrieval differs from the definition of accuracy and precision within other branches of science and statistics.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Recall.\nRecall is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved.\nIn binary classification, recall is often called sensitivity. So it can be looked at as \"the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query\".\nIt is trivial to achieve recall of 100% by returning all documents in response to any query. Therefore, recall alone is not enough but one needs to measure the number of non-relevant documents also, for example by computing the precision.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Fall-out.\nThe proportion of non-relevant documents that are retrieved, out of all non-relevant documents available:\nIn binary classification, fall-out is closely related to specificity and is equal to formula_9.

Knowledge and awareness of how past performance is evaluated are critical to successful proposals to perform government work.\nAlthough past performance is a natural consideration and has been used as an implied evaluation factor, its use was not formalized by the U.S. government until the 1960s through a Department of Defense past performance reporting system known as the Contractor Performance Report.\nDefining past performance as an evaluation factor distinguishes it from past performance information, or relevant information about a contractor\u2019s actions under previously awarded contracts. In practice in the U.S. government contracting market, the term \u201cpast performance\u201d includes three elements; 1) what work a contractor performed, 2) judgments about the breadth, depth and relevance of that experience and 3) judgments about how well the contractor performed.\nThe Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System, accessible through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System, is the U.S. government enterprise solution for collection and retention of contractor past performance information. The main activity associated with this system is the documentation of contractor and grantee performance information that is required by federal regulations (see Federal Acquisition Regulations part 42.15). This is accomplished in web-enabled reports referred to as CPARS reports or report cards. These reports are available to U.S. government agencies making contract award decisions.\nSection::::Horse Racing.\nPast Performances appear on horse racing programs such as the DRF (Daily Racing Form), Equibase, and Brisnet. Information on jockeys, trainers, date of races, finishes in races, speed figures, odds and more of the last 10 races are provided to give handicappers a sense of history and information to bet with. Horse racing handicappers study the past performance of each horse in a race, examining among other things the combination of speed, endurance and grit demonstrated by the animal in prior meets.\nSection::::Mutual Fund Disclosures.\nThe phrase \u201cpast performance is not an indicator of future performance\u201d (or similar) can be found in the fine print of most mutual fund literature. Nonetheless, past performance of an investment fund or portfolio, and the management thereof, is frequently considered when judging the fund or the management of it. Demonstrating the ability to outperform peers or index funds repeatedly is seen as a way to evaluate a fund manager\u2019s skill.\nThe S&P Persistence Scorecard is published twice a year to answer the question of whether past performance in investment funds matters. This report tracks the consistency of top performers over yearly consecutive periods and measures performance persistence through transition matrices.

Although most likely effective, even unigram words may not be the best representation. Consider the terms \\emph{good} and \\emph{bad}, as mentioned in the classifier example in the previous section. In this scenario, context is very important: Alternatively, Clearly, a bigram words representation would most likely give better performance since we can capture \\emph{not good} and \\emph{not bad} as well as \\emph{was good} and \\emph{was bad}. As a counterexample, using only bigram words leads us to miss out on rarer informative single words such as \\emph{overhyped}. This term is now captured in bigrams such as \\emph{overhyped~(period)} and \\emph{very overhyped}. If we see the same rarer informative word in a different context---such as \\emph{was overhyped}---this is now an out-of-vocabulary term and can't be used in determining the sentence polarity. Due to this phenomenon, it is very common to combine multiple feature sets together. In this case, we can tokenize documents with both unigram and bigram words. A well-known strategy discussed in~\\cite{stamatatos-aa} shows that low-level lexical features combined with high-level syntactic features give the best performance in a classifier. These two types of features are more orthogonal, thus capturing different perspectives of the text to enrich the feature space. Having many different types of features allows the classifier a wide range of space on which to create a decision boundary between different class labels. An example of very high-level features can be found in~\\cite{massung-structure}. Consider the grammatical parse tree discussed in chapter~\\ref{chap:meta} reproduced in Figure~\\ref{fig:parse-features}. Here, we see three versions of increasingly ``high-level'' syntactic features. The bottom left square shows rewrite rules; these are the grammatical productions found in the sentence containing the syntactic node categories. For example, the $S$ represents \\emph{sentence}, which is composed of a noun phrase (NP) followed by a verb phrase (VP), ending with a period. The middle square in Figure~\\ref{fig:parse-features} omits all node labels except the roots of all subtrees. This captures a more abstract view of the production rules, focused more on structure. Lastly, the right square is a fully abstracted structural feature set, with no syntactic category labels at all."], "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/sentiment-classification.jsonl/0": ["One is \\textbf{polarity analysis}, where we have categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.

Looking at the first document, the user can gain three points; looking at the non-relevant documents, the user would only gain one point. This gain usually matches the utility of a document from a user's perspective. If we assume the user stops at ten documents we can cumulatively sum the information gain from traversing the list of returned documents. Let $r_i$ be the gain of result $i$, and let $i$ range from one to $n$, where we set $n$ to ten in our example. We then have the \\textbf{cumulative gain} (CG) as If the user looks at more documents, the cumulative gain is more. This is at the cost of spending more time to examine the list. Thus cumulative gain gives us some idea about how much total gain the user would have if the user examines all these documents. There is one deficiency which is not considering the rank or position of each document. Looking at the CG sum, we know there is only one highly relevant document, one marginally relevant document, two non-relevant documents; we don't know where they are ranked in the list. Ideally, we want the two with gains of three to be ranked on the top. But how can we capture that intuition? The second three is not as good as the first three at the top. That means the contribution of gain from different documents has to be weighted by their position. The document at position one doesn't need to be discounted because you can assume that the user always sees this document, but the second one will be discounted a little bit because there's a small possibility that the user wouldn't notice it. We divide this gain by a weight based on the position in order to capture this position-based penalty. The \\textbf{discounted cumulative gain} does exactly this: Each document's gain is discounted by dividing by a logarithm of its position in the list. Thus, a lowly-ranked document would not contribute contribute as much gain as a highly-ranked document. That means if, for example, you switch the position of $D_5$ and $D_2$, then the overall DCG score would increase since $D_5$'s relevance score of three is discounted less by being close to the top.

Since the accuracy measure does not distinguish different types of categorization errors, it is not appropriate to use it on a data set that has skewed distributions of instances in different classes. For example, in a binary categorization problem, if one category is much more popular than the other, than a trivial baseline that simply puts all instances in the category would have a pretty high categorization accuracy. To more appropriately evaluate such a categorization task, we can examine the categorization performance for each category. For example, we may treat the categorization results for each category as ``retrieval'' results for a query corresponding to the category and apply typical measures used in retrieval such as precision, recall and F measure to quantify the performance in a per-category manner. Readers can find more discussion about this in the reference \\cite{Yang:99}. A \\textbf{confusion matrix} is a way to examine a classifier's performance at a per-label level.

This type of IT Performance Management is usually of interest to executive level IT personnel, all the way up to the Chief Information Officer (CIO), and is related to IT Portfolio Management.\nIn an IT operations context, IT performance management is the subset of tools and processes in IT Operations which deals with the collection, monitoring, and analysis of performance metrics.

You wish to consider the overall performance, but which strategy would you use? Can you think of scenarios where using one of them would make a difference? That is, is there a situation where one measure would give different rankings of the two methods?\nSimilar to our argument about $F_1$, we realize in the arithmetic mean the sum is dominated by large values. Here, a large value means that the query is relatively easy. On the other hand, gMAP tends to be affected more by \\emph{low} values---those are the queries that don't have good performance (the average precision is low). If you wish to improve the search engine for those difficult queries, then gMAP would be preferred. If you just want to improve over all kinds of queries, then perhaps MAP would be preferred. So again, the answer depends on your users' tasks and preferences. Which measure is most likely going to represent your users' needs?\nAs a special case of the mean average precision, we can also think about the case where there is precisely one relevant document in the entire collection. This actually happens quite often, for example, in what's called a \\emph{known item search}, where you know a target page such as Amazon or Facebook. Or in another application such as question answering, there is only one answer. In this scenario, if you rank the answers, then your goal is to rank that one particular answer on top. In this case, the average precision will boil down to the \\textbf{reciprocal rank}. That is, $\\frac{1}{r}$ where $r$ is the position (rank) of the single relevant document. If that document is ranked on the very top, then the reciprocal rank would be $\\frac{1}{1}=1$. If it's ranked at the second position, then it's $\\frac{1}{2}$ and so on. This means we can also take an average of all the reciprocal ranks over a set of topics, which gives us the \\textbf{mean reciprocal rank} (MRR). It's a very popular measure for known item search or any problem where you have just one relevant item."], "textbook/textdatabook/recommender-systems/evaluation.jsonl/2": ["A simple way to aggregate scores would be to take an average of the individual user metrics, \\eg, average $F_1$ score across all users. However, this may not be the best measure if some users have more recommendations than others. Since $\\theta$ is set on a per-user basis, different users will aggregate different numbers of seen documents. Furthermore, in a real system users may not all join at the same time, or some users may have more training data available than others if they have more complete user profiles or if they have been in the system longer. For these reasons, it could be advantageous to instead take a weighted average of user metrics as an overall metric. The weight may be assigned such that all weights sum to one, and each user's weight is determined by that user's total number of judgements."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-34017061": 1, "wikipedia-34542671": 1, "wikipedia-18342114": 2, "wikipedia-22610170": 1, "wikipedia-29697656": 1, "wikipedia-1301906": 2, "wikipedia-4263988": 1, "wikipedia-522230": 1, "wikipedia-5483916": 1, "wikipedia-7251458": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/clustering/evaluation.jsonl/1": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/summary.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/8": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/4": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/joint-analysis/exercises.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/2": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/evaluation.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/categorization.jsonl/4": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/recommender-systems/evaluation.jsonl/2": 2}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-34017061": 1, "wikipedia-34542671": 1, "wikipedia-18342114": 3, "wikipedia-22610170": 1, "wikipedia-29697656": 2, "wikipedia-1301906": 3, "wikipedia-4263988": 1, "wikipedia-522230": 1, "wikipedia-5483916": 2, "wikipedia-7251458": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/clustering/evaluation.jsonl/1": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/summary.jsonl/0": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/8": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/4": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/joint-analysis/exercises.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/2": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/evaluation.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/categorization.jsonl/4": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/recommender-systems/evaluation.jsonl/2": 3}}}

However, for workflow-specific applications, additional context may be needed that Wikipedia alone might not fully address.", "wikipedia-14343887": ["Precision and recall\nIn pattern recognition, information retrieval and binary classification, precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, while recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances. Both precision and recall are therefore based on an understanding and measure of relevance.\nSuppose a computer program for recognizing dogs in photographs identifies 8 dogs in a picture containing 12 dogs and some cats. Of the 8 identified as dogs, 5 actually are dogs (true positives), while the rest are cats (false positives). The program's precision is 5/8 while its recall is 5/12. When a search engine returns 30 pages only 20 of which were relevant while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages, its precision is 20/30 = 2/3 while its recall is 20/60 = 1/3. So, in this case, precision is \"how useful the search results are\", and recall is \"how complete the results are\".\nIn statistics, if the null hypothesis is that all items are \"irrelevant\" (where the hypothesis is accepted or rejected based on the number selected compared with the sample size), absence of type I and type II errors (i.e.: perfect sensitivity and specificity of 100% each) corresponds respectively to perfect precision (no false positive) and perfect recall (no false negative). The above pattern recognition example contained 8 \u2212 5 = 3 type I errors and 12 \u2212 5 = 7 type II errors. Precision can be seen as a measure of exactness or \"quality\", whereas recall is a measure of completeness or \"quantity\". The exact relationship between sensitivity and specificity to precision depends on the percent of positive cases in the population.\nIn simple terms, high precision means that an algorithm returned substantially more relevant results than irrelevant ones, while high recall means that an algorithm returned most of the relevant results.\nSection::::Introduction.\nIn an information retrieval (IR) scenario, the instances are documents and the task is to return a set of relevant documents given a search term; or equivalently, to assign each document to one of two categories, \"relevant\" and \"not relevant\". In this case, the \"relevant\" documents are simply those that belong to the \"relevant\" category. Recall is defined as the \"number of relevant documents\" retrieved by a search \"divided by the total number of existing relevant documents\", while precision is defined as the \"number of relevant documents\" retrieved by a search \"divided by the total number of documents retrieved\" by that search.\nIn a classification task, the precision for a class is the \"number of true positives\" (i.e. the number of items correctly labeled as belonging to the positive class) \"divided by the total number of elements labeled as belonging to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false positives, which are items incorrectly labeled as belonging to the class). Recall in this context is defined as the \"number of true positives divided by the total number of elements that actually belong to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false negatives, which are items which were not labeled as belonging to the positive class but should have been).\nIn information retrieval, a perfect precision score of 1.0 means that every result retrieved by a search was relevant (but says nothing about whether all relevant documents were retrieved) whereas a perfect recall score of 1.0 means that all relevant documents were retrieved by the search (but says nothing about how many irrelevant documents were also retrieved).\nIn a classification task, a precision score of 1.0 for a class C means that every item labeled as belonging to class C does indeed belong to class C (but says nothing about the number of items from class C that were not labeled correctly) whereas a recall of 1.0 means that every item from class C was labeled as belonging to class C (but says nothing about how many other items were incorrectly also labeled as belonging to class C).\nOften, there is an inverse relationship between precision and recall, where it is possible to increase one at the cost of reducing the other. Brain surgery provides an illustrative example of the tradeoff. Consider a brain surgeon tasked with removing a cancerous tumor from a patient\u2019s brain. The surgeon needs to remove all of the tumor cells since any remaining cancer cells will regenerate the tumor. Conversely, the surgeon must not remove healthy brain cells since that would leave the patient with impaired brain function. The surgeon may be more liberal in the area of the brain he removes to ensure he has extracted all the cancer cells. This decision increases recall but reduces precision. On the other hand, the surgeon may be more conservative in the brain he removes to ensure he extracts only cancer cells. This decision increases precision but reduces recall. That is to say, greater recall increases the chances of removing healthy cells (negative outcome) and increases the chances of removing all cancer cells (positive outcome). Greater precision decreases the chances of removing healthy cells (positive outcome) but also decreases the chances of removing all cancer cells (negative outcome).\nUsually, precision and recall scores are not discussed in isolation. Instead, either values for one measure are compared for a fixed level at the other measure (e.g. \"precision at a recall level of 0.75\") or both are combined into a single measure. Examples of measures that are a combination of precision and recall are the F-measure (the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall), or the Matthews correlation coefficient, which is a geometric mean of the chance-corrected variants: the regression coefficients Informedness (DeltaP') and Markedness (DeltaP). Accuracy is a weighted arithmetic mean of Precision and Inverse Precision (weighted by Bias) as well as a weighted arithmetic mean of Recall and Inverse Recall (weighted by Prevalence). Inverse Precision and Inverse Recall are simply the Precision and Recall of the inverse problem where positive and negative labels are exchanged (for both real classes and prediction labels). Recall and Inverse Recall, or equivalently true positive rate and false positive rate, are frequently plotted against each other as ROC curves and provide a principled mechanism to explore operating point tradeoffs. Outside of Information Retrieval, the application of Recall, Precision and F-measure are argued to be flawed as they ignore the true negative cell of the contingency table, and they are easily manipulated by biasing the predictions. The first problem is 'solved' by using Accuracy and the second problem is 'solved' by discounting the chance component and renormalizing to Cohen's kappa, but this no longer affords the opportunity to explore tradeoffs graphically. However, Informedness and Markedness are Kappa-like renormalizations of Recall and Precision, and their geometric mean Matthews correlation coefficient thus acts like a debiased F-measure."], "wikipedia-4011785": ["In statistical analysis of binary classification, the F score (also F-score or F-measure) is a measure of a test's accuracy. It considers both the precision \"p\" and the recall \"r\" of the test to compute the score: \"p\" is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, and \"r\" is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive).

Of the 8 identified as dogs, 5 actually are dogs (true positives), while the rest are cats (false positives). The program's precision is 5/8 while its recall is 5/12. When a search engine returns 30 pages only 20 of which were relevant while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages, its precision is 20/30 = 2/3 while its recall is 20/60 = 1/3. So, in this case, precision is \"how useful the search results are\", and recall is \"how complete the results are\".\nIn a classification task, the precision for a class is the \"number of true positives\" (i.e. the number of items correctly labeled as belonging to the positive class) \"divided by the total number of elements labeled as belonging to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false positives, which are items incorrectly labeled as belonging to the class). Recall in this context is defined as the \"number of true positives divided by the total number of elements that actually belong to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false negatives, which are items which were not labeled as belonging to the positive class but should have been).\nIn information retrieval, a perfect precision score of 1.0 means that every result retrieved by a search was relevant (but says nothing about whether all relevant documents were retrieved) whereas a perfect recall score of 1.0 means that all relevant documents were retrieved by the search (but says nothing about how many irrelevant documents were also retrieved).\nIn a classification task, a precision score of 1.0 for a class C means that every item labeled as belonging to class C does indeed belong to class C (but says nothing about the number of items from class C that were not labeled correctly) whereas a recall of 1.0 means that every item from class C was labeled as belonging to class C (but says nothing about how many other items were incorrectly also labeled as belonging to class C).\nUsually, precision and recall scores are not discussed in isolation. Instead, either values for one measure are compared for a fixed level at the other measure (e.g. \"precision at a recall level of 0.75\") or both are combined into a single measure. Examples of measures that are a combination of precision and recall are the F-measure (the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall), or the Matthews correlation coefficient, which is a geometric mean of the chance-corrected variants: the regression coefficients Informedness (DeltaP') and Markedness (DeltaP). Accuracy is a weighted arithmetic mean of Precision and Inverse Precision (weighted by Bias) as well as a weighted arithmetic mean of Recall and Inverse Recall (weighted by Prevalence). Inverse Precision and Inverse Recall are simply the Precision and Recall of the inverse problem where positive and negative labels are exchanged (for both real classes and prediction labels).

We can use this topic analysis to collect passages of text into a large group of comments on one aspect. Instead of describing this aspect with sorted unigram words, we could run a summarizer on each topic, generating readable text as output. These two methods complement each other, since the first step finds what aspects the users are interested in, while the second step conveys the information. Summarization is an excellent example of this application. For example, consider a financial summarizer with text reports from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as well as raw stock market data. Summarizing both these data sources in one location would be very valuable for (\\eg) mutual fund managers or other financial workers.

They found that 89.5% of people knew at least one familiar stranger. These experiments have been repeated at least once with similar results.Paulos, Eric, and Elizabeth Goodman. \"The Familiar Stranger: Anxiety, Comfort, and Play in Public Places.\" \"Proceedings of SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems\". New York, NY: ACM, 2004. 223-30 One aspect of research on familiar strangers that hampered research was lack of available data about these relationships. With the advent of widespread social media and urban analytics, researchers have used new datasets to understand familiar strangers, including public-transportation usage and web blog networks.\n\nIn 1972, Milgram and his students conducted an experiment to test how widespread the phenomena of familiar strangers was. His students took photographs of people waiting at commuter railway stations during a morning commute. One week later, they returned to the same platform, distributed the photos, and asked recipients to label anyone they either recognized or to whom they had spoken. 89% of the people recognized at least one of the individuals shown in the photos. The average commuter claimed to recognize 4.0 individuals who they had never spoken to, compared to 1.5 individuals they had conversed with. In addition, the experiment observed \"socio-metric stars\" who were recognized by a large portion of commuters. In qualitative interviews, commuters noted that they imagined what kinds of lives familiar strangers led and what kinds of jobs they held. Milgram described this as a \"fantasy relationship that may never eventuate in action.\"\n\nFrom this study, Milgram made a number of observations about how familiar stranger relationships are maintained. He noted that the further removed familiar strangers were from their routine encounters, the more likely they would be to engage in interaction and break the familiar stranger relationship. But he also observed the opposite: that in routine settings, a person would be more likely to interact with a complete stranger than a familiar stranger as the complete stranger had no pre-existing interpersonal barriers to overcome. Finally, he noted that breaks in routines, such as health emergencies or natural disasters would cause familiar strangers to interact with each other.\n\nMilgram attributed the phenomena of familiar strangers to urban information overload. He noted that perceptual processing of others is much less cognitively taxing than socially processing them. Thus people perceptually recognize the familiar stranger but cut off any further interaction.\n\nThe 1972 paper was based on two independent research projects conducted in 1971, one at City University of New York and the other at a train station. \"Psychology Today\" published a second paper on the subject by Milgram, \"Frozen World of the Familiar Stranger\", in 1974.\n\nIn 2004, researchers at the Berkeley Intel Research Laboratory revisited Milgram's study. Their goal was to observe changes in familiar stranger relationships since the initial study and to see how familiarity can affect an individual's comfort in a public place. Recreating Milgram's original experiment, they found similar but slightly-lower levels of the phenomena. They found 77.8% of people recognized at least one familiar stranger with an average of 3.1 strangers recognized. They too found evidence of \"socio-metric stars\" who stood out to many people due to unique visual characteristics like a wheel chair, flowers, or dirty long hair.\n\nFamiliar strangers were also found to affect how comfortable people feel in a public location. Four dimensions determined how familiar strangers affected comfort in a public place: the number of familiar strangers, the level of their familiarity, the history of the familiar people in the location, and whether the familiar strangers are found in other contexts.\n\nThere have been a number of studies that have further characterized the relationship between familiar strangers using automatically generated sets of data from urban systems. Using bus usage data, it was found that a person's set of familiar strangers is highly based on routine and daily behavior. Familiar strangers come into contact typically during a particular time each day and in a particular location. Unlike other social networks that have densely connected neighborhoods, the network of familiar strangers is more diffuse and evenly distributed. This indicates that person's familiar stranger network can quickly stretch an entire metropolitan area. Wi-Fi usage data for university campuses have provided additional datasets for analyzing familiar strangers. These datasets have yielded similar results as the bus usage data, but the researchers divided relationships based on regularity of interaction and closeness of relationship."]}, "textbook/textdatabook": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The variation of transmitted light through an aggregating suspension can be studied with a regular spectrophotometer in the visible region. As aggregation proceeds, the medium becomes more turbid, and its absorbance increases. The increase of the absorbance can be related to the aggregation rate constant \"k\" and the stability ratio can be estimated from such measurements. The advantage of this technique is its simplicity.\nLight scattering. These techniques are based on probing the scattered light from an aggregating suspension in a time-resolved fashion. Static light scattering yields the change in the scattering intensity, while dynamic light scattering the variation in the apparent hydrodynamic radius. At early-stages of aggregation, the variation of each of these quantities is directly proportional to the aggregation rate constant \"k\". At later stages, one can obtain information on the clusters formed (e.g., fractal dimension). Light scattering works well for a wide range of particle sizes. Multiple scattering effects may have to be considered, since scattering becomes increasingly important for larger particles or larger aggregates. Such effects can be neglected in weakly turbid suspensions. Aggregation processes in strongly scattering systems have been studied with transmittance, backscattering techniques or diffusing-wave spectroscopy.\nSingle particle counting. This technique offers excellent resolution, whereby clusters made out of tenths of particles can be resolved individually. The aggregating suspension is forced through a narrow capillary particle counter and the size of each aggregate is being analyzed by light scattering. From the scattering intensity, one can deduce the size of each aggregate, and construct a detailed aggregate size distribution. If the suspensions contain high amounts of salt, one could equally use a Coulter counter. As time proceeds, the size distribution shifts towards larger aggregates, and from this variation aggregation and breakup rates involving different clusters can be deduced. The disadvantage of the technique is that the aggregates are forced through a narrow capillary under high shear, and the aggregates may disrupt under these conditions.\nIndirect techniques. As many properties of colloidal suspensions depend on the state of aggregation of the suspended particles, various indirect techniques have been used to monitor particle aggregation too. While it can be difficult to obtain quantitative information on aggregation rates or cluster properties from such experiments, they can be most valuable for practical applications. Among these techniques settling tests are most relevant. When one inspects a series of test tubes with suspensions prepared at different concentration of the flocculant, stable suspensions often remain dispersed, while the unstable ones settle. Automated instruments based on light scattering/transmittance to monitor suspension settling have been developed, and they can be used to probe particle aggregation. One must realize, however, that these techniques may not always reflect the actual aggregation state of a suspension correctly. For example, larger primary particles may settle even in the absence of aggregation, or aggregates that have formed a colloidal gel will remain in suspension. Other indirect techniques capable to monitor the state of aggregation include, for example, filtration, rheology, absorption of ultrasonic waves, or dielectric properties."], "wikipedia-24698840": ["Aggregation algorithms must do two things:\n- Decide when two constituents should be aggregated\n- Decide how two constituents should be aggregated, and create the aggregated structure\n\nThe first issue, deciding when to aggregate, is poorly understood. Aggegration decisions certainly depend on the semantic relations between the constituents, as mentioned above; they also depend on the genre (e.g., bureaucratic texts tend to be more aggregated than instruction manuals). They probably should depend on rhetorical and discourse structure. The literacy level of the reader is also probably important (poor readers need shorter sentences). But we have no integrated model which brings all these factors together into a single algorithm.\n\nWith regard to the second issue, there have been some studies of different types of aggregation, and how they should be carried out.

This enables the SOC and IR teams to have as much data as possible regarding a certain threat actor, his capabilities, and his infrastructure to properly act on the threat. A TIP will usually enrich the collected data with information such as IP geolocation, ASN networks and various other information from sources such as IP and domain blocklists.\nBULLET::::- Analyze \u2013 The TIP automatically analyzes the content of threat indicators and the relationships between them to enable the production of usable, relevant, and timely threat intelligence from the data collected. This analysis enables the identification of a threat actor's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). In addition, visualization capabilities help depict complex relationships and allow users to pivot to reveal greater detail and subtle relationships. A proven method for analysis within the TIP framework is the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis. The Diamond Model enables teams to build a clear picture of how adversaries operate and inform an overall response more effectively. This process helps teams refine and place data in context to develop an effective action plan. For example, a threat intelligence analyst may perform relationship modeling on a phishing email to determine who sent it, who received the email, the domains it is registered to, IP addresses that resolve to that domain, etc. From here, the analyst can pivot further to reveal other domains that use the same DNS resolver, the internal hosts that try to connect to it, and what other host/domain name requests have been attempted. The Diamond Model differs from the Cyber Kill Chain\u00ae approach (attributed to Lockheed Martin) which theorizes that, as a defender, an organization needs only to disrupt one link in the chain to compromise an attack. However, not all the stages of an attack are apparent to the defender. While reconnaissance steps may be detectable if an attacker is browsing its victim\u2019s website, the weaponization stage remains hidden. The Diamond Model, however, focuses more on understanding the attacker (their TTPs and motivations). Instead of looking at a series of events, the Model looks at relationships between features to help defenders better understand the threat. This ensures a more effective overall response. Rather than play whack-a-mole with persistent threats, organizations build a picture of how they operate and can take steps to address those facts directly.\nBULLET::::- Integrate \u2013 Integrations are a key requirement of a TIP. Data from the platform needs to find a way back into the security tools and products used by an organization. Full-featured TIPs enable the flow of information collected and analyzed from feeds, etc. and disseminate and integrate the cleaned data to other network tools including SIEMs, internal ticketing systems, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and more.

This level of community participation can\u2019t be achieved without a sophisticated threat intelligence platform. Powerful TIPs enable these communities to create tools and applications that can be used to continue to change the game for security professionals. In this model, analysts and developers freely share applications with one another, choose and modify applications, and accelerate solution development through plug-and-play activities.

Some people refer specifically to flocculation when aggregation is induced by addition of polymers or polyelectrolytes, while coagulation is used in a broader sense.\n\nIn the early stage of the aggregation process, the suspension mainly contains particle monomers and some dimers. The rate of this reaction is characterized by the aggregation rate coefficient \"k\". Since doublet formation is a second order rate process, the units of this coefficients are ms since particle concentrations are expressed as particle number per unit volume (m). Since absolute aggregation rates are difficult to measure, one often refers to the dimensionless stability ratio \"W\" = \"k\"/\"k\" where \"k\" is the aggregation rate coefficient in the fast regime, and \"k\" the coefficient at the conditions of interest. The stability ratio is close to unity in the fast regime, increases in the slow regime, and becomes very large when the suspension is stable.\n\nWhen the interaction potential between the particles is purely attractive, the aggregation process is solely limited by mutual diffusion (or Brownian motion) of the particles, one refers to \"fast\", \"rapid\" or \"diffusion limited aggregation\" (DLA). When the interaction potential shows an intermediate barrier, the aggregation is slowed down by the fact that numerous attempts will be necessary to overcome this barrier, and one refers to \"slow\" or \"reaction limited aggregation\" (RLA). The aggregation can be tuned from fast to slow by varying the concentration of salt, pH, or an other additive. Since the transition from fast to slow aggregation occurs in a narrow concentration range, and one refers to this range as the critical coagulation concentration (CCC).\n\nWhen particle aggregation is solely driven by diffusion, one refers to \"perikinetic\" aggregation. Aggregation can be enhanced through shear stress (e.g., stirring). The latter case is called \"orthokinetic\" aggregation.\n\nAs the aggregation process continues, larger clusters form. The growth occurs mainly through encounters between different clusters, and therefore one refers to cluster-cluster aggregation process. The resulting clusters are irregular, but statistically self-similar. They are examples of mass fractals, whereby their mass \"M\" grows with their typical size characterized by the radius of gyration \"R\" as a power-law\nwhere \"d\" is the mass fractal dimension. Depending whether the aggregation is fast or slow, one refers to diffusion limited cluster aggregation (DLCA) or reaction limited cluster aggregation (RLCA). The clusters have different characteristics in each regime. DLCA clusters are loose and ramified (\"d\" \u2248 1.8), while the RLCA clusters are more compact (\"d\" \u2248 2.1). The cluster size distribution is also different in these two regimes.

Aggegration decisions certainly depend on the semantic relations between the constituents, as mentioned above; they also depend on the genre (e.g., bureaucratic texts tend to be more aggregated than instruction manuals). They probably should depend on rhetorical and discourse structure. The literacy level of the reader is also probably important (poor readers need shorter sentences). But we have no integrated model which brings all these factors together into a single algorithm.\nWith regard to the second issue, there have been some studies of different types of aggregation, and how they should be carried out.

This task is alleviated by the fact that such characteristics can unmistakably be identified by their measurement formula. Bases on the model comparison, it is possible to identify the models that are suited for measuring productivity. A criterion of this solution is the production theory and the production function. It is essential that the model is able to describe the production function.\nThe principle of model comparison becomes evident in the figure. There are two dimensions in the comparison. Horizontal model comparison refers to a comparison between business models. Vertical model comparison refers to a comparison between economic levels of activity or between the levels of business, industry and national economy.\nAt all three levels of economy, that is, that of business, industry and national economy, a uniform understanding prevails of the phenomenon of productivity and of how it should be modelled and measured. The comparison reveals some differences that can mainly be seen to result from differences in measuring accuracy. It has been possible to develop the productivity model of business so as to be more accurate than that of national economy for the simple reason that in business the measuring data are much more accurate. (Saari 2006b)\nSection::::Business models.\nThere are several different models available for measuring productivity. Comparing the models systematically has proved most problematic. In terms of pure mathematics it has not been possible to establish the different and similar characteristics of them so as to be able to understand each model as such and in relation to another model. This kind of comparison is possible using the productivity model which is a model with adjustable characteristics. An adjustable model can be set with the characteristics of the model under review after which both differences and similarities are identifiable.\nA characteristic of the productivity measurement models that surpasses all the others is the ability to describe the production function. If the model can describe the production function, it is applicable to total productivity measurements. On the other hand, if it cannot describe the production function or if it can do so only partly, the model is not suitable for its task. The productivity models based on the production function form rather a coherent entity in which differences in models are fairly small. The differences play an insignificant role, and the solutions that are optional can be recommended for good reasons. Productivity measurement models can differ in characteristics from another in six ways.\nBULLET::::1. First, it is necessary to examine and clarify the differences in the names of the concepts. Model developers have given different names to the same concepts, causing a lot of confusion. It goes without saying that differences in names do not affect the logic of modelling.\nBULLET::::2. Model variables can differ; hence, the basic logic of the model is different. It is a question of which variables are used for the measurement. The most important characteristic of a model is its ability to describe the production function. This requirement is fulfilled in case the model has the production function variables of productivity and volume. Only the models that meet this criterion are worth a closer comparison. (Saari 2006b)\nBULLET::::3. Calculation order of the variables can differ. Calculation is based on the principle of Ceteris paribus stating that when calculating the impacts of change in one variable all other variables are held constant. The order of calculating the variables has some effect on the calculation results, yet, the difference is not significant.\nBULLET::::4. Theoretical framework of the model can be either cost theory or production theory. In a model based on the production theory, the volume of activity is measured by input volume. In a model based on the cost theory, the volume of activity is measured by output volume.\nBULLET::::5. Accounting technique, i.e. how measurement results are produced, can differ. In calculation, three techniques apply: ratio accounting, variance accounting and accounting form. Differences in the accounting technique do not imply differences in accounting results but differences in clarity and intelligibility. Variance accounting gives the user most possibilities for an analysis.\nBULLET::::6. Adjustability of the model. There are two kinds of models, fixed and adjustable. On an adjustable model, characteristics can be changed, and therefore, they can examine the characteristics of the other models. A fixed model can not be changed. It holds constant the characteristic that the developer has created in it.\nBased on the variables used in the productivity model suggested for measuring business, such models can be grouped into three categories as follows:\nBULLET::::- Productivity index models\nBULLET::::- PPPV models\nBULLET::::- PPPR models\nIn 1955, Davis published a book titled Productivity Accounting in which he presented a productivity index model. Based on Davis\u2019 model several versions have been developed, yet, the basic solution is always the same (Kendrick & Creamer 1965, Craig & Harris 1973, Hines 1976, Mundel 1983, Sumanth 1979). The only variable in the index model is productivity, which implies that the model can not be used for describing the production function. Therefore, the model is not introduced in more detail here.\nPPPV is the abbreviation for the following variables, profitability being expressed as a function of them:\n\"Profitability = f (Productivity, Prices, Volume)\"\nThe model is linked to the profit and loss statement so that profitability is expressed as a function of productivity, volume and unit prices. Productivity and volume are the variables of a production function, and using them makes it is possible to describe the real process. A change in unit prices describes a change of production income distribution.\nPPPR is the abbreviation for the following function:\n\"Profitability = f (Productivity, Price Recovery)\"\nIn this model, the variables of profitability are productivity and price recovery. Only the productivity is a variable of the production function. The model lacks the variable of volume, and for this reason, the model can not describe the production function. The American models of REALST (Loggerenberg & Cucchiaro 1982, Pineda 1990) and APQC (Kendrick 1984, Brayton 1983, Genesca & Grifell, 1992, Pineda 1990) belong to this category of models but since they do not apply to describing the production function (Saari 2000) they are not reviewed here more closely.\nSection::::Comparative summary of the models.\nPPPV models measure profitability as a function of productivity, volume and income distribution (unit prices). Such models are\nBULLET::::- Japanese Kurosawa (1975)\nBULLET::::- French Courbois & Temple (1975)\nBULLET::::- Finnish Saari (1976, 2000, 2004, 2006a, 2006b)\nBULLET::::- American Gollop (1979)\nThe table presents the characteristics of the PPPV models. All four models use the same variables by which a change in profitability is written into formulas to be used for measurement. These variables are income distribution (prices), productivity and volume. A conclusion is that the basic logic of measurement is the same in all models. The method of implementing the measurements varies to a degree, depending on the fact that the models do not produce similar results from the same calculating material.\nEven if the production function variables of profitability and volume were in the model, in practice the calculation can also be carried out in compliance with the cost function. This is the case in models C & T as well as Gollop. Calculating methods differ in the use of either output volume or input volume for measuring the volume of activity. The former solution complies with the cost function and the latter with the production function. It is obvious that the calculation produces different results from the same material. A recommendation is to apply calculation in accordance with the production function. According to the definition of the production function used in the productivity models Saari and Kurosawa, productivity means the quantity and quality of output per one unit of input.\nModels differ from one another significantly in their calculation techniques. Differences in calculation technique do not cause differences in calculation results but it is rather a question of differences in clarity and intelligibility between the models. From the comparison it is evident that the models of Courbois & Temple and Kurosawa are purely based on calculation formulas. The calculation is based on the aggregates in the loss and profit account. Consequently, it does not suit to analysis. The productivity model Saari is purely based on variance accounting known from the standard cost accounting. The variance accounting is applied to elementary variables, that is, to quantities and prices of different products and inputs. Variance accounting gives the user most possibilities for analysis. The model of Gollop is a mixed model by its calculation technique. Every variable is calculated using a different calculation technique. (Saari 2006b)\nThe productivity model Saari is the only model with alterable characteristics. Hence, it is an adjustable model. A comparison between other models has been feasible by exploiting this particular characteristic of this model."], "wikipedia-62329": ["Existing methods for meta-analysis yield a weighted average from the results of the individual studies, and what differs is the manner in which these weights are allocated and also the manner in which the uncertainty is computed around the point estimate thus generated.

This shows that system A is better according to precision. But we also mentioned that system B might be preferred by some other users who wish to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible. So, in that case we have to compare the number of total relevant documents to the number that is actually retrieved. This is captured in another measure called \\textbf{recall}, which measures the completeness of coverage of relevant documents in your retrieval result. We assume that there are ten relevant documents in the collection. Here we've got two of them from system A, so the recall is \\frac{2}{10}=0.20. System B has \\frac{3}{10}=0.30. Therefore, system B is better according to recall. These two measures are the very basic foundation for evaluating search engines. They are very important because they are also widely used in many other evaluation problems. For example, if you look at the applications of machine learning you tend to see precision and recall numbers being reported for all kinds of tasks. Now, let's define these two measures more precisely and how these measures are used to evaluate a set of retrieved documents. That means we are considering that approximation of a set of relevant documents. We can distinguish the results in four cases, depending on the situation of a document as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:basicmeasure}. A document is either retrieved or not retrieved since we're talking about the \\emph{set} of results. The document can be also relevant or not relevant, depending on whether the user thinks this is a useful document. We now have counts of documents in each of the four categories. We can have $a$ represent the number of documents that are retrieved and relevant, $b$ for documents that are not retrieved but relevant, $c$ for documents that are retrieved but not relevant, and $d$ for documents that are both not retrieved and not relevant. With this table, we have defined precision as the ratio of the relevant retrieved documents $a$ to the total number of retrieved documents $a$ and $c$: \\frac{a}{a+c}. In this case, the denominator is all the retrieved documents. Recall is defined by dividing $a$ by the sum of $a$ and $b$, where $a+b$ is the total number of relevant documents.

They are very important because they are also widely used in many other evaluation problems. For example, if you look at the applications of machine learning you tend to see precision and recall numbers being reported for all kinds of tasks. Now, let's define these two measures more precisely and how these measures are used to evaluate a set of retrieved documents. That means we are considering that approximation of a set of relevant documents. We can distinguish the results in four cases, depending on the situation of a document as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:basicmeasure}.\nA document is either retrieved or not retrieved since we're talking about the \\emph{set} of results. The document can be also relevant or not relevant, depending on whether the user thinks this is a useful document. We now have counts of documents in each of the four categories. We can have $a$ represent the number of documents that are retrieved and relevant, $b$ for documents that are not retrieved but relevant, $c$ for documents that are retrieved but not relevant, and $d$ for documents that are both not retrieved and not relevant.\nWith this table, we have defined precision as the ratio of the relevant retrieved documents $a$ to the total number of retrieved documents $a$ and $c$: $\\frac{a}{a+c}$. In this case, the denominator is all the retrieved documents.\nRecall is defined by dividing $a$ by the sum of $a$ and $b$, where $a+b$ is the total number of relevant documents. Precision and recall are focused on looking at $a$, the number of retrieved relevant documents. The two measures differ based on the denominator of the formula.\nSo what would be an ideal result? If precision and recall are both 1.0, that means all the results that we returned are relevant, and we didn't miss any relevant documents; there's no single non-relevant document returned. In reality however, high recall tends to be associated with low precision; as you go down the list to try to get as many relevant documents as possible, you tend to include many non-relevant documents, which decreases the precision. We often are interested in the precision up to ten documents for web search. This means we look at the top ten results and see how many documents among them are actually relevant. This is a very meaningful measure, because it tells us how many relevant documents a user can expect to see on the first page of search results (where there are typically ten results)."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/8": ["Average precision is computed for just one query. Generally though, we\nexperiment with many different queries in order to avoid the variance across\nthem. For example, one system may perform very well with one query while another\nsystem performs poorly; using only this query would not give an accurate\nassessment of each systems' capability. Using more queries then requires the\nresearcher to take an average of the average precision over all these queries.\nNaturally, we can simply calculate an arithmetic mean. In fact, this would give\nus what's called \\textbf{mean average precision}, or MAP\\@. In this case, we\ntake arithmetic mean of all the average precisions over several queries or\ntopics. Let $\\mathcal{L}={L_1,L_2,\\ldots,L_m}$ be the ranked lists returned from\nrunning $m$ different queries. Then we have\nRecall our discussion about the $F_1$ score. In this situation, is an arithmetic\nmean of average precisions acceptable? We concluded before that the arithmetic\nmean of precision and recall was not as good as the harmonic mean. Here, we have\na similar situation: we should think about the alternative ways of aggregating\nthe average precisions. Another way is the geometric mean; using the geometric\nmean to consolidate the average precisions is called \\textbf{geometric mean\naverage precision}, or gMAP for short. We define it below mathematically as\nor in log space as\nImagine you are again testing a new algorithm. You've tested multiple topics\n(queries) and have the average precision for each topic. You wish to consider\nthe overall performance, but which strategy would you use? Can you think of\nscenarios where using one of them would make a difference? That is, is there a\nsituation where one measure would give different rankings of the two methods?\nSimilar to our argument about $F_1$, we realize in the arithmetic mean the sum\nis dominated by large values. Here, a large value means that the query is\nrelatively easy. On the other hand, gMAP tends to be affected more by \\emph{low}\nvalues---those are the queries that don't have good performance (the average\nprecision is low). If you wish to improve the search engine for those difficult\nqueries, then gMAP would be preferred. If you just want to improve over all\nkinds of queries, then perhaps MAP would be preferred.

On the other hand, a 3rd and 9 on the team\u2019s own 3 yard line is heavily negative because it drastically favors the opponent.\n\nThe value of each play\u2019s outcome is measured by the snap-to-snap change in expected points. This is called Expected Points Added. The Expected Points Added (or lost) in each play are divided among the contributing players on the field based on the role of each player and the type of play. Deeper throws give a higher share of credit to the QB, while screen passes give relatively less credit to the QB and more to the receiver.\n\nPlays that occur in \u201ctrash time\u201d are discounted by as much as 30%. Trash time is measured based on the leverage of each play which is primarily a function of score, time, and field position. Important, critical plays that are likely to change the outcome have high leverage, while plays that occur after the game has largely been already decided have low leverage. QBR discounts low leverage plays, but does not boost credit for \u201cclutch\u201d plays.\n\nAfter each play\u2019s Expected Points Added is adjusted for difficulty, division of credit, and trash time, it is averaged on a per play basis. This average is further adjusted to account for the strength of opponent. Performance against a stronger defense that tends to allow low adjusted EPA per play is adjusted upwards while performance against a weaker defense is adjusted downwards. The degree of adjustment is in direct proportion to the strength of the opponent.\n\nLastly, the resulting adjusted EPA per play is transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, where 50 is average. The result can be thought of as a percentile. For example, a QBR of 80 means that the QB\u2019s performance is better than 80% of the game performances by QB\u2019s since 2006. A game QBR of 80 would also mean that, given that QB\u2019s performance, his team would be expected to win that game on average 80% of the time."]}, "textbook/textdatabook": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Thus we need to evaluate the quality of a ranked list as opposed to whether\na relevant document was returned anywhere in the results.\nHow can we use precision and recall to evaluate a ranked list? Naturally, we\nwill have to look at precision and recall at different cutoffs since a ranked\nlist of relevant documents is determined by where the user stops browsing. If we\nassume the user sequentially browses the list of results, the user would stop at\nsome point. That point would determine the size of the set. Therefore, that's\nthe most important cutoff that we have to consider when we compute the\nprecision-recall.\nWithout knowing where exactly the user would stop, we have to consider all the\npossible positions where they might stop. A \\textbf{precision-recall} curve does\nexactly this as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:prcurve}\nWhat if the user stops at the first document? What's the precision-recall at\nthis point? Since $D_1$ is relevant, the precision is one out of one since we\nhave one document and it is relevant. What about the recall? Note that we are\nassuming that there are ten relevant documents for this query in the collection\nso it's one out of ten.\nWhat if the user stops at the second position? The precision is the same since\nboth $D_1$ and $D_2$ are relevant: 100\\%, or two out of two. The recall is two\nout of ten, or 20\\%. If the user stops at the third position, we have an\ninteresting case because we don't have any additional relevant documents, so the\nrecall does not change. However, the precision is lower because we have two out\nof three relevant documents. The recall won't change until we see another\nrelevant document. In this case, that point is at $D_5$. There, the recall has\nincreased to three out of ten and the precision is three out of five. As you can\nsee, if we keep doing this, we can also get to $D_8$ and have a precision of\nfour out of eight, because there are eight documents and four of them are\nrelevant. There, the recall is four out of ten.\nWhen can we get a recall of five out of ten? In this list, we don't have it. For\nconvenience, we often assume that the precision is zero in a situation like\nthis. This is a pessimistic assumption since the actual position would be\nhigher, but we make this assumption in order to have an easy way to compute\nanother measure called \\emph{average precision}, that we will discuss soon.\nNote that we've made some assumptions that are clearly not accurate. But, this\nis okay for the relative comparison of two text retrieval methods. As long as\nthe deviation is not biased toward any particular retrieval method, the measure\nis acceptable since we can still accurately tell which method works better. This\nis the most important point to keep in mind: when you compare different\nalgorithms, the key is to avoid any bias toward a particular method. As long as\nyou can avoid that, it's perfectly fine to do a transformation of these measures\nthat preserves the order.\nSince we can get a lot of precision-recall numbers at different positions, we\ncan plot a curve; this is what's shown on the right side of\nFigure~\\ref{fig:prcurve}. On the $x$-axis are the recall values. On the $y$-axis\nare the precision values. We plot precision-recall numbers so that we display at\nwhat recall we can obtain a certain precision. Furthermore, we can link these\npoints to form a curve. As you see in the figure, we assumed all the precision\nvalues at the high-level recalls are zero.

This mode of text access is essential when a user has an ad hoc information need, \\ie, a temporary information need that might disappear once the need is satisfied. In such a case, the user can use a query to find relevant information with a search engine. For example, a user may have a need to buy a product and thus be interested in retrieving all the relevant opinions about candidate products; after the user has purchased the product, the user would generally no longer need such information. Another example is that during the process of analyzing social media data to understand opinions about an emerging event, the analyst may also decide to explore information about a particular entity related to the event (\\eg, a person), which can also trigger a search activity.\nWhile querying is the most common way of accessing text data in the pull mode, browsing is another complementary way of accessing text data in the pull mode, and can be very useful when a user does not know how to formulate an effective query, or finds it inconvenient to enter a keyword query (\\eg, through a smartphone), or simply wants to explore a topic with no fixed goal. Indeed, when searching the Web, users tend to mix querying and browsing (\\eg, while traversing through hyperlinks).\nIn general, we may regard querying and browsing as two complementary ways of finding relevant information in the information space. Their relation can be understood by making an analogy between information seeking and sightseeing in a physical world. When a tourist knows the exact address of an attraction, the tourist can simply take a taxi directly to the attraction; this is similar to when a user knows exactly what he or she is looking for and can formulate a query with the ``right keywords'', which would bring to the user relevant pages directly. However, if a tourist doesn't know the exact address of an attraction, the tourist may want to take a taxi to an approximate location and then {\\em walk} around to find the attraction. Similarly, if a user does not have a good knowledge about the target pages, he or she can also use an approximate query to reach some related pages and then {\\em browse} into truly relevant information. Thus, when querying does not work well, browsing can be very useful.\nIn the push mode, the system initiates the process to recommend a set of relevant information items to the user. This mode of information access is generally more useful to satisfy a long-standing information need of a user or analyst. For example, a researcher's research interests can be regarded as relatively stable over time. In comparison, the information stream (\\ie, published research articles) is dynamic. In such a scenario, although a user can regularly search for relevant literature information with queries, it is more desirable for a recommender (also called filtering) system to monitor the dynamic information stream and ``push'' any relevant articles to the user based on the matching of the articles with the user's interests (\\eg, in the form of an email). In some long-term analytics applications, it would also be desirable to use the push mode to monitor any relevant text data (such as relevant social media) about a topic related to the application.\nAnother scenario of push mode is producer-initiated recommendation, which can be more appropriately called selective dissemination of information (SDI). In such a scenario, the producer of information has an interest in disseminating the information among relevant users, and would push an information item to such users. Advertising of product information on search result pages is such an example. The recommendation can be delivered through email notifications or recommended through a search engine result page."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-50734392": 1, "wikipedia-1803590": 1, "wikipedia-54189079": 1, "wikipedia-4732658": 1, "wikipedia-50123287": 1, "wikipedia-27914444": 1, "wikipedia-637199": 1, "wikipedia-17620416": 1, "wikipedia-35537678": 1, "wikipedia-6518342": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/2": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/recommender-systems/content-based.jsonl/7": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/4": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/text-access-overview/exercises.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/nlp/nlp-tis.jsonl/2": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/text-access-overview/pull-push.jsonl/1": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/joint-analysis/exercises.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/background/ml.jsonl/1": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-50734392": 1, "wikipedia-1803590": 1, "wikipedia-54189079": 1, "wikipedia-4732658": 1, "wikipedia-50123287": 1, "wikipedia-27914444": 1, "wikipedia-637199": 1, "wikipedia-17620416": 1, "wikipedia-35537678": 1, "wikipedia-6518342": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/2": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/0": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/recommender-systems/content-based.jsonl/7": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/4": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/text-access-overview/exercises.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/nlp/nlp-tis.jsonl/2": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/text-access-overview/pull-push.jsonl/1": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/joint-analysis/exercises.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/background/ml.jsonl/1": 1}}}

Such metrics are often split into kinds: online metrics look at users' interactions with the search system, while offline metrics measure relevance, in other words how likely each result, or search engine results page (SERP) page as a whole, is to meet the information needs of the user.\nSection::::Online metrics.\nOnline metrics are generally created from search logs. The metrics are often used to determine the success of an A/B test.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Session abandonment rate.\nSession abandonment rate is a ratio of search sessions which do not result in a click.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Click-through rate.\nClick-through rate (CTR) is the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. It is commonly used to measure the success of an online advertising campaign for a particular website as well as the effectiveness of email campaigns.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Session success rate.\nSession success rate measures the ratio of user sessions that lead to a success. Defining \"success\" is often dependent on context, but for search a successful result is often measured using dwell time as a primary factor along with secondary user interaction, for instance, the user copying the result URL is considered a successful result, as is copy/pasting from the snippet.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Zero result rate.\n\"Zero result rate\" (\"ZRR\") is the ratio of SERPs which returned with zero results. The metric either indicates a recall issue, or that the information being searched for is not in the index.\nSection::::Offline metrics.\nOffline metrics are generally created from relevance judgment sessions where the judges score the quality of the search results. Both binary (relevant/non-relevant) and multi-level (e.g., relevance from 0 to 5) scales can be used to score each document returned in response to a query. In practice, queries may be ill-posed, and there may be different shades of relevance. For instance, there is ambiguity in the query \"mars\": the judge does not know if the user is searching for the planet Mars, the Mars chocolate bar, or the singer Bruno Mars.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Precision.\nPrecision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are relevant to the user's information need.\nIn binary classification, precision is analogous to positive predictive value. Precision takes all retrieved documents into account. It can also be evaluated at a given cut-off rank, considering only the topmost results returned by the system. This measure is called \"precision at n\" or \"P@n\".\nNote that the meaning and usage of \"precision\" in the field of information retrieval differs from the definition of accuracy and precision within other branches of science and statistics.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Recall.\nRecall is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved.\nIn binary classification, recall is often called sensitivity. So it can be looked at as \"the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query\".\nIt is trivial to achieve recall of 100% by returning all documents in response to any query. Therefore, recall alone is not enough but one needs to measure the number of non-relevant documents also, for example by computing the precision.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Fall-out.\nThe proportion of non-relevant documents that are retrieved, out of all non-relevant documents available:\nIn binary classification, fall-out is closely related to specificity and is equal to formula_9. It can be looked at as \"the probability that a non-relevant document is retrieved by the query\".\nIt is trivial to achieve fall-out of 0% by returning zero documents in response to any query.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:F-score / F-measure.\nThe weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, the traditional F-measure or balanced F-score is:\nThis is also known as the formula_11 measure, because recall and precision are evenly weighted.\nThe general formula for non-negative real formula_12 is:\nTwo other commonly used F measures are the formula_14 measure, which weights recall twice as much as precision, and the formula_15 measure, which weights precision twice as much as recall.\nThe F-measure was derived by van Rijsbergen (1979) so that formula_16 \"measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches formula_12 times as much importance to recall as precision\". It is based on van Rijsbergen's effectiveness measure formula_18. Their relationship is:\nF-measure can be a better single metric when compared to precision and recall; both precision and recall give different information that can complement each other when combined. If one of them excels more than the other, F-measure will reflect it.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Average precision.\nPrecision and recall are single-value metrics based on the whole list of documents returned by the system. For systems that return a ranked sequence of documents, it is desirable to also consider the order in which the returned documents are presented. By computing a precision and recall at every position in the ranked sequence of documents, one can plot a precision-recall curve, plotting precision formula_21 as a function of recall formula_22. Average precision computes the average value of formula_21 over the interval from formula_24 to formula_25:\nThat is the area under the precision-recall curve.\nThis integral is in practice replaced with a finite sum over every position in the ranked sequence of documents:\nwhere formula_28 is the rank in the sequence of retrieved documents, formula_29 is the number of retrieved documents, formula_30 is the precision at cut-off formula_28 in the list, and formula_32 is the change in recall from items formula_33 to formula_28.\nThis finite sum is equivalent to:\nwhere formula_36 is an indicator function equaling 1 if the item at rank formula_28 is a relevant document, zero otherwise. Note that the average is over all relevant documents and the relevant documents not retrieved get a precision score of zero.\nSome authors choose to interpolate the formula_21 function to reduce the impact of \"wiggles\" in the curve. For example, the PASCAL Visual Object Classes challenge (a benchmark for computer vision object detection) until 2010 computed the average precision by averaging the precision over a set of evenly spaced recall levels {0, 0.1, 0.2, ... 1.0}:\nwhere formula_40 is an interpolated precision that takes the maximum precision over all recalls greater than formula_22:\nAn alternative is to derive an analytical formula_21 function by assuming a particular parametric distribution for the underlying decision values. For example, a \"binormal precision-recall curve\" can be obtained by assuming decision values in both classes to follow a Gaussian distribution.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Precision at K.\nFor modern (web-scale) information retrieval, recall is no longer a meaningful metric, as many queries have thousands of relevant documents, and few users will be interested in reading all of them. Precision at k documents (P@k) is still a useful metric (e.g., P@10 or \"Precision at 10\" corresponds to the number of relevant results on the first search results page), but fails to take into account the positions of the relevant documents among the top k. Another shortcoming is that on a query with fewer relevant results than k, even a perfect system will have a score less than 1. It is easier to score manually since only the top k results need to be examined to determine if they are relevant or not.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:R-Precision.\nR-precision requires knowing all documents that are relevant to a query.

We can't use average precision since it only operates on binary relevance values; if we treat level two and three as only one level, then we lose the information gained from comparing these two categories. MAP, gMAP, and MRR depend on average precision, so we can't use them either.\nLet's look at the top relevant results when using these judgments. We imagine the user would mostly care about the top ten results. We call these multi-level judgements ``gains'', since they roughly correspond to how much information a user \\emph{gains} when viewing a document. Looking at the first document, the user can gain three points; looking at the non-relevant documents, the user would only gain one point. This gain usually matches the utility of a document from a user's perspective. If we assume the user stops at ten documents we can cumulatively sum the information gain from traversing the list of returned documents. Let $r_i$ be the gain of result $i$, and let $i$ range from one to $n$, where we set $n$ to ten in our example. We then have the \\textbf{cumulative gain} (CG) as\nIf the user looks at more documents, the cumulative gain is more. This is at the cost of spending more time to examine the list. Thus cumulative gain gives us some idea about how much total gain the user would have if the user examines all these documents.\nThere is one deficiency which is not considering the rank or position of each document. Looking at the CG sum, we know there is only one highly relevant document, one marginally relevant document, two non-relevant documents; we don't know where they are ranked in the list. Ideally, we want the two with gains of three to be ranked on the top. But how can we capture that intuition? The second three is not as good as the first three at the top. That means the contribution of gain from different documents has to be weighted by their position. The document at position one doesn't need to be discounted because you can assume that the user always sees this document, but the second one will be discounted a little bit because there's a small possibility that the user wouldn't notice it. We divide this gain by a weight based on the position in order to capture this position-based penalty. The \\textbf{discounted cumulative gain} does exactly this:\nEach document's gain is discounted by dividing by a logarithm of its position in the list. Thus, a lowly-ranked document would not contribute contribute as much gain as a highly-ranked document. That means if, for example, you switch the position of $D_5$ and $D_2$, then the overall DCG score would increase since $D_5$'s relevance score of three is discounted less by being close to the top.\nAt this point, we have a discounted cumulative gain for measuring the utility of a ranked list with multiple levels of judgment. We still need to do a little bit more in order to make this measure comparable across different queries. The idea here is \\textbf{normalized discounted cumulative gain}, or NDCG\\@:\nIt is simply DCG normalized by the ideal DCG (IDCG) for a particular query. The IDCG is the most relevant documents at the top, sorted in decreasing order of relevance. For example, imagine that we have nine documents in the whole collection rated three. Then, our ideal ranked list would have put all these nine documents on the very top. All this would be followed by a two, because that's the best we could do after we have run out of threes. Then, we can compute the DCG for this ideal ranked list. This becomes the denominator for NDCG in order to normalize our own DCG in the range $[0,1]$.

There are several reasons why TR is difficult: In summary, the common tasks and issues between structured and unstructured data are very similar, though the approaches to solve them are quite different. Tasks with unstructured text data are often open-ended with no definite solution. We may be able to mathematically show that one retrieval algorithm is better than another, but this depends on the document representation, corpus size, corpus topic, and evaluation metric all remaining constant.

Since the accuracy measure does not distinguish different types of categorization errors, it is not appropriate to use it on a data set that has skewed distributions of instances in different classes. For example, in a binary categorization problem, if one category is much more popular than the other, than a trivial baseline that simply puts all instances in the category would have a pretty high categorization accuracy. To more appropriately evaluate such a categorization task, we can examine the categorization performance for each category. For example, we may treat the categorization results for each category as ``retrieval'' results for a query corresponding to the category and apply typical measures used in retrieval such as precision, recall and F measure to quantify the performance in a per-category manner.

If the application is search, the question becomes: does adding query expansion via word association mining improve MAP at a statistically-significant level? We know how to perform this type of evaluation from chapter~\\ref{chap:evaluation}. The variable we control here between the two experiments is whether we perform query expansion or not. To be more thorough, we can compare query expansion with word association mining to query expansion with (\\eg) Rocchio feedback as a baseline model.\n\nTo evaluate word association mining in isolation, we would need some set of gold standard data. If we don't have such data, we would need to use human manual effort to judge whether the associations found are acceptable. Let's first consider the case where we have gold-standard data.\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume we wish to evaluate syntagmatic association mining. Given a word, the task may be to rank all other words in the vocabulary according to how similar they are to the target word. Thus, we could compute average precision for each word, and use MAP as a summary metric over each word that we evaluate. Of course, if such ranked lists contained numerical relevance scores we could instead use NDCG and average NDCG.\n\nA human-based evaluation metric would be \\textbf{intrusion detection}. In fact, this is one measure described in the evaluation of topic models~\\cite{reading-tea-leaves}, which we discuss further in chapter~\\ref{chap:topic-analysis}. If the word associations are good, it should be fairly easy to find an ``intruder'' that has been added into the top $k$ similar words. For example, consider the following two examples of intrusion detection presented in~\\cite{reading-tea-leaves}. We have two lists with $k+1=6$ items. The top $k=5$ items are chosen for some word in the vocabulary and an additional random word from the vocabulary is also added.\n\nFinally, it's important to consider the time-accuracy tradeoff of using such a tool in word association mining. Imagine the scenario where we have a baseline system with a MAP of $0.89$ on some dataset. If we use query expansion via word association mining, we can get a statistically significantly higher MAP of $0.90$. However, this doesn't take into account the preprocessing time of mining the word associations. In this example, the query time is not affected because the word association mining takes place beforehand offline, but it still is a non-negligible cost. The application manager would have to decide whether an increase in MAP of $0.01$ is worth the effort of implementing, running, and maintaining the query expansion program. This is actually quite a realistic and general issue whenever new technology is proposed to replace or extend an existing one.

This method is also called randomized control trials (RCT). The single difference estimator compares mean outcomes at end-line and is valid where treatment and control groups have the same outcome values at baseline.

These measures differ from one another by the variables they measure and by the variables excluded from measurements. The measurable variables in economics are quantity, quality and distribution. Excluding variables from measurement makes it possible to better focus the measurement on a given variable, yet, this means a more narrow approach.\n\nSection::::Variables.\nThe measurable variables in economics are quantity, quality and distribution. Measuring quantity in economics follows the rules of measuring in physics. Quality as a variable refers to qualitative changes in the production process. Qualitative changes take place when relative of different constant-price input and output factors alter. Distribution as a variable of the production refers to a series of events in which the unit prices of constant-quality products and inputs alter causing a change in income distribution among those participating in the exchange. The magnitude of the change in income distribution is directly proportionate to the change in prices of the output and inputs and to their quantities. Productivity gains are distributed, for example, to customers as lower product prices or to staff as higher pay.\n\nSection::::Physical measure.\nA physical measure can measure the quantity of a variable with unchanged quality. Using a physical measure provides that the quality of the measurement object has been specified and the quality remains homogeneous. If the presumed unchanged quality is not realized, the measurement gives results which are hard to interpret. In this case, the results are affected by changes in both quantity and quality but in which proportion is unknown. Values of the objects being measured are by no means related to the physical measures, hence, changes in prices do not affect the measurement results. Normally it is not possible to combine physical measures. They are best suited for narrow-focused measurements with neither quality nor value alterations. Therefore, physical measures are best for measuring the real process, and this is why they are used a lot as tools of operative management. Typical ratios in a real process are capacity, efficiencies, lead times, loads, faults, product and process characteristics, etc.\n\nSection::::Fixed-price value.\nA fixed-price value measure is used to measure changes in quality and quantity. True to its name, prices are kept fixed for a minimum of two measuring situations. For this reason, it is possible to define the changes in quality and quantity of a most varied and wide range of commodities, keeping apart the changes in income distribution. Fixed-price measures are suited for wide-ranging measurement because it is possible to combine different commodities based on their value. In a fixed-price measurement, a change in quality means that the relative quantities and relative prices of various commodities change. The best known applications of this are the productivity formula and the production function. The production function is always presented with fixed-price ratios, i.e., its variables, productivity and volume, are fixed-price values.\n\nSection::::Nominal price value.\nThe most common figures in measuring business are the figures because they can describe the profitability of business process. Variables in the nominal price measurement are quality, quantities and distribution (in form of product prices). There are no excluded variables. Nominal price measures of value are suited for measuring profitability and its components as well as the value of reserves.

Of the three criteria mentioned above, coherence and separation can be measured automatically with measures such as vector similarity, purity, or mutual information.\n\nWe may choose to encode terms as word vectors and use the document similarity measures, or we may wish to use some other concept of semantic similarity as defined by preexisting ontologies like WordNet\\footnote{\\url{https://wordnet.princeton.edu/}}. Although slightly more challenging, the concept of utility can also be captured if the final system output can be measured quantitatively. For example, if clustering is used as a component in search, we can see if using a different clustering algorithm improves $F_1$, MAP, or NCDG (see chapter~\\ref{chap:evaluation}).\n\nAll clustering methods need some notion of similarity (or bias). After all, we wish to find groups of objects that are \\emph{similar} to one another in some way.\n\nAs we saw in this chapter, similarity-based algorithms explicitly encode a similarity function in their implementation. Ideally, this similarity between objects is optimized to maximize intra-cluster coherence and minimize intra-cluster separation.

A clustering algorithm would be effective if it was able to partition the products based on their text into categories that roughly matched the predefined ones. A simple measure to evaluate this application would be to consider each output cluster and see if one of the predefined categories dominates the cluster population. In other words, take each cluster $C_i$ and calculate the percentage of each predefined class in it.

It's actually a methodology that has been very useful not only for search engine evaluation, but also for evaluating virtually all kinds of empirical tasks. For example, in image processing or other fields where the problem is empirically defined we typically would need to use a method such as this. The basic idea of this approach is to build reusable test collections and define measures using these collections. Once such a test collection is built, it can be used again and again to test different algorithms or ideas. Using these test collections, we will define measures that allow us to quantify the performance of a system or algorithm. The assembled test collection of documents is similar to a real document collection in a search application. We can also have a sample set of queries or topics that simulate the user's information need. Then, we need to have relevance judgments. These are judgments of which documents should be returned for which queries. Ideally, they have to be made by users who formulated the queries because those are the people that know exactly what the documents (search results) would be used for. Finally, we have to have measures to quantify how well a system's result matches the ideal ranked list. These would be constructed and based on users' relevance judgements. This methodology is very useful for evaluating retrieval algorithms because the test set can be reused many times. It also provides a fair comparison for all the methods, since the evaluation is exactly the same for each one. That is, we have the same criteria, same corpus, and same relevance judgements to compare the different algorithms. This allows us to compare a new algorithm with an old algorithm that was invented many years ago by using the same approach."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": ["We saw that precision and recall are the two basic ways to quantitatively measure the performance of a search result.\nBut, as we talked about in depth in chapter~\\ref{chap:access}, the text retrieval problem is a \\emph{ranking} problem, not a classification one. Thus we need to evaluate the quality of a ranked list as opposed to whether a relevant document was returned anywhere in the results.\nHow can we use precision and recall to evaluate a ranked list? Naturally, we will have to look at precision and recall at different cutoffs since a ranked list of relevant documents is determined by where the user stops browsing. If we assume the user sequentially browses the list of results, the user would stop at some point. That point would determine the size of the set. Therefore, that's the most important cutoff that we have to consider when we compute the precision-recall.\nWithout knowing where exactly the user would stop, we have to consider all the possible positions where they might stop. A \\textbf{precision-recall} curve does exactly this as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:prcurve}\nWhat if the user stops at the first document? What's the precision-recall at this point? Since $D_1$ is relevant, the precision is one out of one since we have one document and it is relevant. What about the recall? Note that we are assuming that there are ten relevant documents for this query in the collection so it's one out of ten.\nWhat if the user stops at the second position? The precision is the same since both $D_1$ and $D_2$ are relevant: 100\\%, or two out of two. The recall is two out of ten, or 20\\%. If the user stops at the third position, we have an interesting case because we don't have any additional relevant documents, so the recall does not change. However, the precision is lower because we have two out of three relevant documents. The recall won't change until we see another relevant document. In this case, that point is at $D_5$. There, the recall has increased to three out of ten and the precision is three out of five. As you can see, if we keep doing this, we can also get to $D_8$ and have a precision of four out of eight, because there are eight documents and four of them are relevant. There, the recall is four out of ten.\nWhen can we get a recall of five out of ten? In this list, we don't have it. For convenience, we often assume that the precision is zero in a situation like this. This is a pessimistic assumption since the actual position would be higher, but we make this assumption in order to have an easy way to compute another measure called \\emph{average precision}, that we will discuss soon.\nNote that we've made some assumptions that are clearly not accurate. But, this is okay for the relative comparison of two text retrieval methods. As long as the deviation is not biased toward any particular retrieval method, the measure is acceptable since we can still accurately tell which method works better. This is the most important point to keep in mind: when you compare different algorithms, the key is to avoid any bias toward a particular method. As long as you can avoid that, it's perfectly fine to do a transformation of these measures that preserves the order."], "textbook/textdatabook/text-access-overview/vs-database.jsonl/0": ["First, the data managed by a search engine and a database system are different. In databases, the data are {\\em structured} where each field has a clearly defined meaning according to a schema. Thus the data can be viewed as a table with well-specified columns. For example, in a bank database system, one field may be customer names, another may be the address, and yet another may be the balance of each type of account. In contrast, the data managed by a search engine are {\\em unstructured} text which can be difficult for computers to understand \footnote{Although common parlance refers to text as unstructured with a meaningful contrast with relational database structuring, it employs a narrow sense of ``structure.'' For example, from a linguistics perspective, grammar provides well-defined structure. To study this matter further, see the 5S (societies, scenarios, spaces, structures, and streams) works by Fox et al. \\cite{fox5s}}. Thus even if a sentence says a person lives in a particular address, it remains difficult for the computer to answer a query about the address of a person in response to a keyword query since there is no simple defined structure to free text. Thus structured data are often easier to manage and analyze since they conform to a clearly defined schema where the meaning of each field is well defined. Second, a consequence of the difference in the data is that the queries that can be supported by the two are also different. A database query clearly specifies the constraints on the fields of the data table, and thus the expected retrieval results (answers to the query) are very well specified with no ambiguity. In a search engine, however, the queries are generally keyword queries, which are only a vague specification of what documents should be returned. Even if the computer can fully understand the semantics of natural language text, it is still often the case that the user's information need is vague due to the lack of complete knowledge about the information to be found (which is often the reason why the user wants to find the information in the first place!). For example, in the case of searching for relevant literature to a research problem, the user is unlikely able to clearly and completely specify which documents should be returned. Finally, the expected results in the two applications are also different. In database search, we can retrieve very specific data elements (\\eg, specific columns); in text retrieval, we are generally only able to retrieve a set of relevant documents. With passages or fields identified in a text document, a search engine can also retrieve passages, but it is generally difficult to retrieve specific entities or attribute values as we can in a database. This difference is not as essential as the difference in the vague specification of what exactly is the ``correct'' answer to a query, but is a direct consequence of the vague information need in text retrieval."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/3": ["Intuitively we thought that system A is better because it did not have much noise. In particular we have seen, out of three results, two are relevant. On the other hand, in System B we have five results and only three of them are relevant. Based on this, it looks like system A is more \\emph{accurate}. This can be captured by the measure of \textbf{precision}, where we simply compute to what extent all the retrieval results are relevant. One hundred percent precision that would mean all the retrieved documents are relevant. Thus in this case, system A has a precision of $\frac{2}{3}=0.6\\overline{6}$. System B has $\frac{3}{5}=0.60$. This shows that system A is better according to precision.\nBut we also mentioned that system B might be preferred by some other users who wish to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible. So, in that case we have to compare the number of total relevant documents to the number that is actually retrieved. This is captured in another measure called \textbf{recall}, which measures the completeness of coverage of relevant documents in your retrieval result. We assume that there are ten relevant documents in the collection. Here we've got two of them from system A, so the recall is $\frac{2}{10}=0.20$. System B has $\frac{3}{10}=0.30$. Therefore, system B is better according to recall.\nThese two measures are the very basic foundation for evaluating search engines. They are very important because they are also widely used in many other evaluation problems. For example, if you look at the applications of machine learning you tend to see precision and recall numbers being reported for all kinds of tasks. Now, let's define these two measures more precisely and how these measures are used to evaluate a set of retrieved documents. That means we are considering that approximation of a set of relevant documents. We can distinguish the results in four cases, depending on the situation of a document as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:basicmeasure}.\nA document is either retrieved or not retrieved since we're talking about the \\emph{set} of results. The document can be also relevant or not relevant, depending on whether the user thinks this is a useful document. We now have counts of documents in each of the four categories. We can have $a$ represent the number of documents that are retrieved and relevant, $b$ for documents that are not retrieved but relevant, $c$ for documents that are retrieved but not relevant, and $d$ for documents that are both not retrieved and not relevant. With this table, we have defined precision as the ratio of the relevant retrieved documents $a$ to the total number of retrieved documents $a$ and $c$: $\frac{a}{a+c}$. In this case, the denominator is all the retrieved documents. Recall is defined by dividing $a$ by the sum of $a$ and $b$, where $a+b$ is the total number of relevant documents. Precision and recall are focused on looking at $a$, the number of retrieved relevant documents. The two measures differ based on the denominator of the formula."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/8": ["Average precision is computed for just one query. Generally though, we experiment with many different queries in order to avoid the variance across them. For example, one system may perform very well with one query while another system performs poorly; using only this query would not give an accurate assessment of each systems' capability. Using more queries then requires the researcher to take an average of the average precision over all these queries. Naturally, we can simply calculate an arithmetic mean. In fact, this would give us what's called \\textbf{mean average precision}, or MAP@. In this case, we take arithmetic mean of all the average precisions over several queries or topics.\n\nRecall our discussion about the $F_1$ score. In this situation, is an arithmetic mean of average precisions acceptable? We concluded before that the arithmetic mean of precision and recall was not as good as the harmonic mean. Here, we have a similar situation: we should think about the alternative ways of aggregating the average precisions. Another way is the geometric mean; using the geometric mean to consolidate the average precisions is called \\textbf{geometric mean average precision}, or gMAP for short.\n\nIf you wish to improve the search engine for those difficult queries, then gMAP would be preferred. If you just want to improve over all kinds of queries, then perhaps MAP would be preferred. So again, the answer depends on your users' tasks and preferences.\n\nAs a special case of the mean average precision, we can also think about the case where there is precisely one relevant document in the entire collection. This actually happens quite often, for example, in what's called a \\emph{known item search}, where you know a target page such as Amazon or Facebook. Or in another application such as question answering, there is only one answer. In this scenario, if you rank the answers, then your goal is to rank that one particular answer on top. In this case, the average precision will boil down to the \\textbf{reciprocal rank}. That is, $\\frac{1}{r}$ where $r$ is the position (rank) of the single relevant document. If that document is ranked on the very top, then the reciprocal rank would be $\\frac{1}{1}=1$. If it's ranked at the second position, then it's $\\frac{1}{2}$ and so on.

These measures differ from one another by the variables they measure and by the variables excluded from measurements. The measurable variables in economics are quantity, quality and distribution. Excluding variables from measurement makes it possible to better focus the measurement on a given variable, yet, this means a more narrow approach. The table was compiled to compare the basic types of measurement. The first column presents the measure types, the second the variables being measured, and the third column gives the variables excluded from measurement. \nSection::::Variables.\nThe measurable variables in economics are quantity, quality and distribution. Measuring quantity in economics follows the rules of measuring in physics. Quality as a variable refers to qualitative changes in the production process. Qualitative changes take place when relative of different constant-price input and output factors alter. Distribution as a variable of the production refers to a series of events in which the unit prices of constant-quality products and inputs alter causing a change in income distribution among those participating in the exchange. The magnitude of the change in income distribution is directly proportionate to the change in prices of the output and inputs and to their quantities. Productivity gains are distributed, for example, to customers as lower product prices or to staff as higher pay.\nSection::::Physical measure.\nA physical measure can measure the quantity of a variable with unchanged quality. Using a physical measure provides that the quality of the measurement object has been specified and the quality remains homogeneous. If the presumed unchanged quality is not realized, the measurement gives results which are hard to interpret. In this case, the results are affected by changes in both quantity and quality but in which proportion is unknown. Values of the objects being measured are by no means related to the physical measures, hence, changes in prices do not affect the measurement results. Normally it is not possible to combine physical measures. They are best suited for narrow-focused measurements with neither quality nor value alterations. Therefore, physical measures are best for measuring the real process, and this is why they are used a lot as tools of operative management. Typical ratios in a real process are capacity, efficiencies, lead times, loads, faults, product and process characteristics, etc.\nSection::::Fixed-price value.\nA fixed-price value measure is used to measure changes in quality and quantity. True to its name, prices are kept fixed for a minimum of two measuring situations. For this reason, it is possible to define the changes in quality and quantity of a most varied and wide range of commodities, keeping apart the changes in income distribution. Fixed-price measures are suited for wide-ranging measurement because it is possible to combine different commodities based on their value. In a fixed-price measurement, a change in quality means that the relative quantities and relative prices of various commodities change. The best known applications of this are the productivity formula and the production function. The production function is always presented with fixed-price ratios, i.e., its variables, productivity and volume, are fixed-price values.\nSection::::Nominal price value.\nThe most common figures in measuring business are the figures because they can describe the profitability of business process. Variables in the nominal price measurement are quality, quantities and distribution (in form of product prices). There are no excluded variables. Nominal price measures of value are suited for measuring profitability and its components as well as the value of reserves. Return and costs in the loss and profit statement are typical examples of a nominal price. In short-term reviews with only little production income distribution taking place, nominal price values are well suited for estimates of fixed price values."], "wikipedia-1674621": ["also a systematic approach for quality measurement of modeling techniques known as complexity metrics suggested by Rossi et al. (1996). Techniques of Meta model is used as a basis for computation of these complexity metrics. In comparison to quality framework proposed by Krogstie, quality measurement focus more on technical level instead of individual model level.\nAuthors (Cardoso, Mendling, Neuman and Reijers, 2006) used complexity metrics to measure the simplicity and understandability of a design. This is supported by later research done by Mendling \"et al.\" who argued that without using the quality metrics to help question quality properties of a model, simple process can be modeled in a complex and unsuitable way. This in turn can lead to a lower understandability, higher maintenance cost and perhaps inefficient execution of the process in question.\nThe quality of modeling technique is important in creating models that are of quality and contribute to the correctness and usefulness of models.\nSection::::Quality of models.\nEarliest process models reflected the dynamics of the process with a practical process obtained by instantiation in terms of relevant concepts, available technologies, specific implementation environments, process constraints and so on.\nEnormous number of research has been done on quality of models but less focus has been shifted towards the quality of process models. Quality issues of process models cannot be evaluated exhaustively however there are four main guidelines and frameworks in practice for such. These are: top-down quality frameworks, bottom-up metrics related to quality aspects, empirical surveys related to modeling techniques, and pragmatic guidelines.\nHommes quoted Wang \"et al.\" (1994) that all the main characteristic of quality of models can all be grouped under 2 groups namely correctness and usefulness of a model, correctness ranges from the model correspondence to the phenomenon that is modeled to its correspondence to syntactical rules of the modeling and also it is independent of the purpose to which the model is used.\nWhereas the usefulness can be seen as the model being helpful for the specific purpose at hand for which the model is constructed at first place. Hommes also makes a further distinction between internal correctness (empirical, syntactical and semantic quality) and external correctness (validity).\nA common starting point for defining the quality of conceptual model is to look at the linguistic properties of the modeling language of which syntax and semantics are most often applied.\nAlso the broader approach is to be based on semiotics rather than linguistic as was done by Krogstie using the top-down quality framework known as SEQUAL. It defines several quality aspects based on relationships between a model, knowledge Externalisation, domain, a modeling language, and the activities of learning, taking action, and modeling.\nThe framework does not however provide ways to determine various degrees of quality but has been used extensively for business process modeling in empirical tests carried out \nAccording to previous research done by Moody \"et al.\" with use of conceptual model quality framework proposed by Lindland \"et al.\" (1994) to evaluate quality of process model, three levels of quality were identified:\nBULLET::::- Syntactic quality: Assesses extent to which the model conforms to the grammar rules of modeling language being used.\nBULLET::::- Semantic quality: whether the model accurately represents user requirements\nBULLET::::- Pragmatic quality: whether the model can be understood sufficiently by all relevant stakeholders in the modeling process. That is the model should enable its interpreters to make use of it for fulfilling their need.\nFrom the research it was noticed that the quality framework was found to be both easy to use and useful in evaluating the quality of process models however it had limitations in regards to reliability and difficult to identify defects. These limitations led to refinement of the framework through subsequent research done by Krogstie. This framework is called SEQUEL framework by Krogstie \"et al.\" 1995 (Refined further by Krogstie & J\u00f8rgensen, 2002) which included three more quality aspects.\nBULLET::::- Physical quality: whether the externalized model is persistent and available for the audience to make sense of it.\nBULLET::::- Empirical quality: whether the model is modeled according to the established regulations regarding a given language.\nBULLET::::- Social quality: This regards the agreement between the stakeholders in the modeling domain.\nDimensions of Conceptual Quality framework\nModeling Domain is the set of all statements that are relevant and correct for describing a problem domain, Language Extension is the set of all statements that are possible given the grammar and vocabulary of the modeling languages used. Model Externalization is the conceptual representation of the problem domain.\nIt is defined as the set of statements about the problem domain that are actually made. Social Actor Interpretation and Technical Actor Interpretation are the sets of statements that actors both human model users and the tools that interact with the model, respectively 'think' the conceptual representation of the problem domain contains.\nFinally, Participant Knowledge is the set of statements that human actors, who are involved in the modeling process, believe should be made to represent the problem domain. These quality dimensions were later divided into two groups that deal with physical and social aspects of the model.\nIn later work, Krogstie et al. stated that while the extension of the SEQUAL framework has fixed some of the limitation of the initial framework, however other limitation remain .\nIn particular, the framework is too static in its view upon semantic quality, mainly considering models, not modeling activities, and comparing these models to a static domain rather than seeing the model as a facilitator for changing the domain.\nAlso, the framework's definition of pragmatic quality is quite narrow, focusing on understanding, in line with the semiotics of Morris, while newer research in linguistics and semiotics has focused beyond mere understanding, on how the model is used and affects its interpreters.\nThe need for a more dynamic view in the semiotic quality framework is particularly evident when considering process models, which themselves often prescribe or even enact actions in the problem domain, hence a change to the model may also change the problem domain directly. This paper discusses the quality framework in relation to active process models and suggests a revised framework based on this.\nFurther work by Krogstie \"et al.\" (2006) to revise SEQUAL framework to be more appropriate for active process models by redefining physical quality with a more narrow interpretation than previous research.\nThe other framework in use is Guidelines of Modeling (GoM) based on general accounting principles include the six principles: Correctness, Clarity deals with the comprehensibility and explicitness (System description) of model systems.\nComprehensibility relates to graphical arrangement of the information objects and, therefore, supports the understand ability of a model.\nRelevance relates to the model and the situation being presented. Comparability involves the ability to compare models that is semantic comparison between two models, Economic efficiency; the produced cost of the design process need at least to be covered by the proposed use of cost cuttings and revenue increases.\nSince the purpose of organizations in most cases is the maximization of profit, the principle defines the borderline for the modeling process. The last principle is Systematic design defines that there should be an accepted differentiation between diverse views within modeling.\nCorrectness, relevance and economic efficiency are prerequisites in the quality of models and must be fulfilled while the remaining guidelines are optional but necessary.\nThe two frameworks SEQUAL and GOM have a limitation of use in that they cannot be used by people who are not competent with modeling. They provide major quality metrics but are not easily applicable by non-experts.\nThe use of bottom-up metrics related to quality aspects of process models is trying to bridge the gap of use of the other two frameworks by non-experts in modeling but it is mostly theoretical and no empirical tests have been carried out to support their use.\nMost experiments carried out relate to the relationship between metrics and quality aspects and these works have been done individually by different authors: Canfora et al. study the connection mainly between count metrics (for example, the number of tasks or splits -and maintainability of software process models); Cardoso validates the correlation between control flow complexity and perceived complexity; and Mendling et al. use metrics to predict control flow errors such as deadlocks in process models.\nThe results reveal that an increase in size of a model appears to reduce its quality and comprehensibility.\nFurther work by Mendling et al. investigates the connection between metrics and understanding and While some metrics are confirmed regarding their effect, also personal factors of the modeler \u2013 like competence \u2013 are revealed as important for understanding about the models.\nSeveral empirical surveys carried out still do not give clear guidelines or ways of evaluating the quality of process models but it is necessary to have clear set of guidelines to guide modelers in this task. Pragmatic guidelines have been proposed by different practitioners even though it is difficult to provide an exhaustive account of such guidelines from practice.\nIn, 10 tips for process modeling are summarized, many technical definitions and rules are provided, but it does not teach how to create process models that are effective in their primary mission - maximizing shared understanding of the as-is or to-be process.\nMost of the guidelines are not easily put to practice but \"label activities verb\u2013noun\" rule has been suggested by other practitioners before and analyzed empirically.\nFrom the research. value of process models is not only dependent on the choice of graphical constructs but also on their annotation with textual labels which need to be analyzed. It was found that it results in better models in terms of understanding than alternative labelling styles.\nFrom the earlier research and ways to evaluate process model quality it has been seen that the process model's size, structure, expertise of the modeler and modularity affect its overall comprehensibility.\nBULLET::::- G1 Minimize the number of elements in a model\nBULLET::::- G2 Min..."]}, "textbook/textdatabook": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

In other\nwords, take each cluster $C_i$ and calculate the percentage of each predefined\nclass in it. The clustering algorithm would be effective if, for each $C_i$,\none predefined category dominates and scarcely appears in other clusters.\nEffectively, the clustering algorithm recreated the class assignments in the\noriginal dataset without any supervision. Of course though, we have to be\ncareful (if this is a parameter), to set the final number of clusters to match\nthe number of classes.\nIn fact, deciding the optimal number of clusters is a hard problem for all\nmethods! For example, in $K$-means, the final clusters depend on the initial\nrandom starting positions. Thus it's quite common to run the algorithm several\ntimes and manually inspect the results. The algorithm $G$-means~\\cite{gmeans}\nreruns $K$-means in a more principled way, splitting clusters if the data\nassigned to each cluster"], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/4": ["The \\textbf{Cranfield evaluation methodology} was developed in the 1960s and is\na strategy for laboratory testing of system components. It's actually a\nmethodology that has been very useful not only for search engine evaluation, but\nalso for evaluating virtually all kinds of empirical tasks. For example, in\nimage processing or other fields where the problem is empirically defined we\ntypically would need to use a method such as this.\nThe basic idea of this approach is to build reusable test collections and define\nmeasures using these collections. Once such a test collection is built, it can\nbe used again and again to test different algorithms or ideas. Using these test\ncollections, we will define measures that allow us to quantify the performance\nof a system or algorithm. The assembled test collection of documents is similar\nto a real document collection in a search application. We can also have a sample\nset of queries or topics that simulate the user's information need. Then, we\nneed to have \\textbf{relevance judgments}. These are judgments of which\ndocuments should be returned for which queries. Ideally, they have to be made by\nusers who formulated the queries because those are the people that know exactly\nwhat the documents (search results) would be used for. Finally, we have to have\nmeasures to quantify how well a system's result matches the ideal ranked list.\nThese would be constructed and based on users' relevance judgements.\nThis methodology is very useful for evaluating retrieval algorithms because the\ntest set can be reused many times. It also provides a fair comparison for all\nthe methods, since the evaluation is exactly the same for each one. That is, we\nhave the same criteria, same corpus, and same relevance judgements to compare\nthe different algorithms. This allows us to compare a new algorithm with an old\nalgorithm that was invented many years ago by using the same approach.\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:evalmethod}, we illustrate how the Cranfield evaluation\nmethodology works. As mentioned, we need a set of queries that are shown here.\nWe have $Q_1, Q_2,$ and so on. We also need the document collection,\n$D_1,D_2,\\ldots$, and on the far right side of the figure, we have the relevance\njudgments which are plus or minus annotations on each document specifying\nwhether it is relevant (plus) or not relevant (minus). Essentially, these are\nbinary judgments of documents with respect to a specific query since there are\nonly two levels of relevance. For example, $D_1$ and $D_2$ are judged as being\nrelevant to $Q_1$. $D_3$ is judged as non-relevant with respect to $Q_1$. These\n$Q_i$ judgements are created by users that interact with each system. Once we\nhave these judgements, we can compare two or more systems. Each query is run on\neach system, and we investigate the documents that each system returns.\nLet's say the query is $Q_1$. In the figure we have $R_A$ as ranked results from\nsystem A and $R_B$ as the ranked results from system B. Thus $R_A$ is system A's\napproximation of relevant documents and $R_B$ is system B's approximation. Let's\ntake a look at these results---which is better? As a user, which one would you\nlike? There are some differences and there are some documents that are returned\nby both systems. But if you look at the results you will feel that maybe system\nA is better in the sense that we don't have that many documents returned, and\namong the three documents returned two of them are relevant. That's good; system\nA is precise. On the other hand, we can also say system B is better because it\nreturned \\emph{more} relevant documents; it returned three instead of two. So\nwhich one is better and how do we quantify this? This question highly depends on\na user's task, and it depends on the individual users as well! For some users,\nmaybe system A is better if the user is not interested in getting all the\nrelevant documents so he or she doesn't have to read too much. On the other\nhand, imagine a user might need to have as many relevant documents as possible,\nfor example, in writing a literature survey. You might be in the second\ncategory, and then you might find that system B is better. In either case, we'll\nhave to also define measures that would quantify the information need of a user.\nWe will need to define multiple measures because users have different\nperspectives when looking at the results."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": ["We saw that precision and recall are the two basic ways to\nquantitatively measure the performance of a search result.\nBut, as we talked about in depth in chapter~\\ref{chap:access},\nthe text retrieval problem is a \\emph{ranking} problem, not a classification\none. Thus we need to evaluate the quality of a ranked list as opposed to whether\na relevant document was returned anywhere in the results.\nHow can we use precision and recall to evaluate a ranked list? Naturally, we\nwill have to look at precision and recall at different cutoffs since a ranked\nlist of relevant documents is determined by where the user stops browsing. If we\nassume the user sequentially browses the list of results, the user would stop at\nsome point. That point would determine the size of the set. Therefore, that's\nthe most important cutoff that we have to consider when we compute the\nprecision-recall.\nWithout knowing where exactly the user would stop, we have to consider all the\npossible positions where they might stop. A \\textbf{precision-recall} curve does\nexactly this as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:prcurve}\nWhat if the user stops at the first document? What's the precision-recall at\nthis point? Since $D_1$ is relevant, the precision is one out of one since we\nhave one document and it is relevant. What about the recall? Note that we are\nassuming that there are ten relevant documents for this query in the collection\nso it's one out of ten.\nWhat if the user stops at the second position? The precision is the same since\nboth $D_1$ and $D_2$ are relevant: 100\\%, or two out of two. The recall is two\nout of ten, or 20\\%. If the user stops at the third position, we have an\ninteresting case because we don't have any additional relevant documents, so the\nrecall does not change. However, the precision is lower because we have two out\nof three relevant documents. The recall won't change until we see another\nrelevant document. In this case, that point is at $D_5$. There, the recall has\nincreased to three out of ten and the precision is three out of five. As you can\nsee, if we keep doing this, we can also get to $D_8$ and have a precision of\nfour out of eight, because there are eight documents and four of them are\nrelevant. There, the recall is four out of ten.\nWhen can we get a recall of five out of ten? In this list, we don't have it. For\nconvenience, we often assume that the precision is zero in a situation like\nthis. This is a pessimistic assumption since the actual position would be\nhigher, but we make this assumption in order to have an easy way to compute\nanother measure called \\emph{average precision}, that we will discuss soon."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/3": ["This can be captured by the measure of \textbf{precision}, where we simply compute to what extent all the retrieval results are relevant. One hundred percent precision that would mean all the retrieved documents are relevant. Thus in this case, system A has a precision of $\\frac{2}{3}=0.6\\overline{6}$. System B has $\\frac{3}{5}=0.60$. This shows that system A is better according to precision.\nBut we also mentioned that system B might be preferred by some other users who wish to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible. So, in that case we have to compare the number of total relevant documents to the number that is actually retrieved. This is captured in another measure called \textbf{recall}, which measures the completeness of coverage of relevant documents in your retrieval result. We assume that there are ten relevant documents in the collection. Here we've got two of them from system A, so the recall is $\\frac{2}{10}=0.20$. System B has $\\frac{3}{10}=0.30$. Therefore, system B is better according to recall.\nThese two measures are the very basic foundation for evaluating search engines. They are very important because they are also widely used in many other evaluation problems. For example, if you look at the applications of machine learning you tend to see precision and recall numbers being reported for all kinds of tasks. Now, let's define these two measures more precisely and how these measures are used to evaluate a set of retrieved documents. That means we are considering that approximation of a set of relevant documents. We can distinguish the results in four cases, depending on the situation of a document as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:basicmeasure}.\nA document is either retrieved or not retrieved since we're talking about the \\emph{set} of results. The document can be also relevant or not relevant, depending on whether the user thinks this is a useful document. We now have counts of documents in each of the four categories. We can have $a$ represent the number of documents that are retrieved and relevant, $b$ for documents that are not retrieved but relevant, $c$ for documents that are retrieved but not relevant, and $d$ for documents that are both not retrieved and not relevant.\nWith this table, we have defined precision as the ratio of the relevant retrieved documents $a$ to the total number of retrieved documents $a$ and $c$: $\\frac{a}{a+c}$. In this case, the denominator is all the retrieved documents.\nRecall is defined by dividing $a$ by the sum of $a$ and $b$, where $a+b$ is the total number of relevant documents. Precision and recall are focused on looking at $a$, the number of retrieved relevant documents. The two measures differ based on the denominator of the formula."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/8": ["Average precision is computed for just one query. Generally though, we\nexperiment with many different queries in order to avoid the variance across\nthem. For example, one system may perform very well with one query while another\nsystem performs poorly; using only this query would not give an accurate\nassessment of each systems' capability. Using more queries then requires the\nresearcher to take an average of the average precision over all these queries.\nNaturally, we can simply calculate an arithmetic mean. In fact, this would give\nus what's called \\textbf{mean average precision}, or MAP\\@. In this case, we\ntake arithmetic mean of all the average precisions over several queries or\ntopics. Let $\\mathcal{L}={L_1,L_2,\\ldots,L_m}$ be the ranked lists returned from\nrunning $m$ different queries. Then we have\nRecall our discussion about the $F_1$ score. In this situation, is an arithmetic\nmean of average precisions acceptable? We concluded before that the arithmetic\nmean of precision and recall was not as good as the harmonic mean. Here, we have\na similar situation: we should think about the alternative ways of aggregating\nthe average precisions. Another way is the geometric mean; using the geometric\nmean to consolidate the average precisions is called \\textbf{geometric mean\naverage precision}, or gMAP for short. We define it below mathematically as\nor in log space as\nImagine you are again testing a new algorithm. You've tested multiple topics\n(queries) and have the average precision for each topic. You wish to consider\nthe overall performance, but which strategy would you use? Can you think of\nscenarios where using one of them would make a difference? That is, is there a\nsituation where one measure would give different rankings of the two methods?\nSimilar to our argument about $F_1$, we realize in the arithmetic mean the sum\nis dominated by large values. Here, a large value means that the query is\nrelatively easy. On the other hand, gMAP tends to be affected more by \\emph{low}\nvalues---those are the queries that don't have good performance (the average\nprecision is low). If you wish to improve the search engine for those difficult\nqueries, then gMAP would be preferred. If you just want to improve over all\nkinds of queries, then perhaps MAP would be preferred. So again, the answer\ndepends on your users' tasks and preferences. Which measure is most likely going\nto represent your users' needs?\nAs a special case of the mean average precision, we can also think about the\ncase where there is precisely one relevant document in the entire collection.\nThis actually happens quite often, for example, in what's called a \\emph{known\nitem search}, where you know a target page such as Amazon or Facebook. Or in\nanother application such as question answering, there is only one answer. In\nthis scenario, if you rank the answers, then your goal is to rank that one\nparticular answer on top. In this case, the average precision will boil down to\nthe \\textbf{reciprocal rank}. That is, $\\frac{1}{r}$ where $r$ is the position\n(rank) of the single relevant document. If that document is ranked on the very\ntop, then the reciprocal rank would be $\\frac{1}{1}=1$. If it's ranked at the\nsecond position, then it's $\\frac{1}{2}$ and so on. This means we can also take\nan average of all the reciprocal ranks over a set of topics, which gives us the\n\\textbf{mean reciprocal rank} (MRR). It's a very popular measure for known item\nsearch or any problem where you have just one relevant item.\nWe can see this $r$ is quite meaningful; it indicates how much effort a user\nwould have to make in order to find that one relevant document. If it's ranked\non the top it's low effort; if it's ranked at 100 then you actually have to\n(presumably) sift through 100 documents in order to find it. Thus $r$ is also a\nmeaningful measure and the reciprocal rank will take the reciprocal of $r$\ninstead of using it directly.\nThe usual question also applies here: why not just simply use $r$? If you were\nto design a ratio to measure the performance of a system where there is only one\nrelevant item, you might have thought about using $r$ directly as the measure.\nAfter all, that measures the user's effort, right? But, think about if you take\nan average of this over a large number of topics.

For example, if clustering is used as a component in search, we can see if using a different clustering algorithm improves $F_1$, MAP, or NCDG (see chapter~\\ref{chap:evaluation}).\n\nMeasuring coherence and separation automatically can potentially be accomplished by leveraging a categorization data set; such a corpus has predefined clusters where each document belongs to a particular category. For example, a text categorization corpus could be product descriptions from an online retailer, and each product belongs in a product category, such as \\emph{kitchenware}, \\emph{books}, \\emph{grocery}, and so on. A clustering algorithm would be effective if it was able to partition the products based on their text into categories that roughly matched the predefined ones. A simple measure to evaluate this application would be to consider each output cluster and see if one of the predefined categories dominates the cluster population. In other words, take each cluster $C_i$ and calculate the percentage of each predefined class in it. The clustering algorithm would be effective if, for each $C_i$, one predefined category dominates and scarcely appears in other clusters. Effectively, the clustering algorithm recreated the class assignments in the original dataset without any supervision. Of course though, we have to be careful (if this is a parameter), to set the final number of clusters to match the number of classes.\n\nIn fact, deciding the optimal number of clusters is a hard problem for all methods! For example, in $K$-means, the final clusters depend on the initial random starting positions. Thus it's quite common to run the algorithm several times and manually inspect the results. The algorithm $G$-means~\\cite{gmeans} reruns $K$-means in a more principled way, splitting clusters if the data assigned to each cluster"], "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/evaluation.jsonl/2": ["As with information retrieval evaluation, we can use precision, recall, and $F_1$ score by considering true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. We are also usually concerned about accuracy, which is defined as the number of correct categorization decisions made by the system divided by the total number of categorization decisions made by the system.  Since the accuracy measure does not distinguish different types of categorization errors, it is not appropriate to use it on a data set that has skewed distributions of instances in different classes. For example, in a binary categorization problem, if one category is much more popular than the other, than a trivial baseline that simply puts all instances in the category would have a pretty high categorization accuracy. To more appropriately evaluate such a categorization task, we can examine the categorization performance for each category. For example, we may treat the categorization results for each category as ``retrieval'' results for a query corresponding to the category and apply typical measures used in retrieval such as precision, recall and F measure to quantify the performance in a per-category manner. Readers can find more discussion about this in the reference \\cite{Yang:99}. Another evaluation paradigm is $n$-fold \\textbf{cross validation}. This splits the corpus into $n$ partitions. In $n$ rounds, one partition is selected as the testing set and the remaining $n-1$ are used for training. The final accuracy, $F_1$ score, or any other evaluation metric is then averaged over the $n$ folds. The variance in scores between the folds can be a hint at the overfitting potential of your algorithm. If the variance is high, it means that the accuracies are not very similar between folds. Having one fold with a very high accuracy suggests that your learning algorithm may have overfit during that training stage; when using that trained algorithm on a separate corpus, it's likely that the accuracy would be very low since it modeled noise or other uninformative features from that particular split (\\ie, it overfit). Another important concept is \\textbf{baseline accuracy}. This represents the minimum score to ``beat'' when using your classifier. Say there are 3000 documents consisting of three classes, each with 1000 documents. In this case, random guessing would give you about $33\\%$ accuracy, since you'd be correct approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the time. Your classifier would have to do better than $33\\%$ accuracy in order to make it useful! In another example, consider the 3000 documents and three classes, but with an uneven class distribution: one class has 2000 documents and the other two classes have 500 each. In this case, the baseline accuracy is $66\\%$, since picking the majority class label will result in correct predictions $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the time. Thus, it's important to take class imbalances into consideration when evaluating a classifier. A \\textbf{confusion matrix} is a way to examine a classifier's performance at a per-label level. Consider Figure~\\ref{fig:conf-matrix}, the output from running \\meta~on a three-class classification problem to determine the native language of the author of English text. Each $(row, column)$ index in the table shows the fraction of times that $row$ was classified as $column$. Therefore, the rows all sum to one. The diagonal represents the true positive rate, and hopefully most of the probability mass lies here, indicating a good classifier. Based on the matrix, we see that predicting Chinese was $80.2\\%"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-21468724": 1, "wikipedia-20845132": 1, "wikipedia-265128": 1, "wikipedia-216333": 1, "wikipedia-9223719": 1, "wikipedia-52316686": 1, "wikipedia-1087159": 1, "wikipedia-38496706": 1, "wikipedia-1630984": 1, "wikipedia-23753362": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/introduction/how-to.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/evaluation.jsonl/0": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/exercises.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/summarization/exercises.jsonl/1": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/clustering/evaluation.jsonl/1": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/text-access-overview/vs-database.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/13": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/summarization/evaluation.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/evaluation.jsonl/2": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/3": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-21468724": 1, "wikipedia-20845132": 1, "wikipedia-265128": 1, "wikipedia-216333": 1, "wikipedia-9223719": 2, "wikipedia-52316686": 1, "wikipedia-1087159": 2, "wikipedia-38496706": 1, "wikipedia-1630984": 1, "wikipedia-23753362": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/introduction/how-to.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/evaluation.jsonl/0": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/exercises.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/summarization/exercises.jsonl/1": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/clustering/evaluation.jsonl/1": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/text-access-overview/vs-database.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/13": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/summarization/evaluation.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/evaluation.jsonl/2": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/3": 1}}}

Thus we need to evaluate the quality of a ranked list as opposed to whether\na relevant document was returned anywhere in the results.\nHow can we use precision and recall to evaluate a ranked list? Naturally, we\nwill have to look at precision and recall at different cutoffs since a ranked\nlist of relevant documents is determined by where the user stops browsing. If we\nassume the user sequentially browses the list of results, the user would stop at\nsome point. That point would determine the size of the set. Therefore, that's\nthe most important cutoff that we have to consider when we compute the\nprecision-recall.\nWithout knowing where exactly the user would stop, we have to consider all the\npossible positions where they might stop. A \\textbf{precision-recall} curve does\nexactly this as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:prcurve}\nWhat if the user stops at the first document? What's the precision-recall at\nthis point? Since $D_1$ is relevant, the precision is one out of one since we\nhave one document and it is relevant. What about the recall?

If the user stops at the third position, we have an\ninteresting case because we don't have any additional relevant documents, so the\nrecall does not change. However, the precision is lower because we have two out\nof three relevant documents. The recall won't change until we see another\nrelevant document. In this case, that point is at $D_5$. There, the recall has\nincreased to three out of ten and the precision is three out of five. As you can\nsee, if we keep doing this, we can also get to $D_8$ and have a precision of\nfour out of eight, because there are eight documents and four of them are\nrelevant. There, the recall is four out of ten.\nWhen can we get a recall of five out of ten? In this list, we don't have it.

One hundred percent precision that would mean all the retrieved documents are relevant. Thus in this case, system A has a precision of \\frac{2}{3}=0.6\\overline{6}. System B has \\frac{3}{5}=0.60. This shows that system A is better according to precision. But we also mentioned that system B might be preferred by some other users who wish to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible. So, in that case we have to compare the number of total relevant documents to the number that is actually retrieved. This is captured in another measure called \textbf{recall}, which measures the completeness of coverage of relevant documents in your retrieval result. We assume that there are ten relevant documents in the collection. Here we've got two of them from system A, so the recall is \\frac{2}{10}=0.20. System B has \\frac{3}{10}=0.30. Therefore, system B is better according to recall. Now, let's define these two measures more precisely and how these measures are used to evaluate a set of retrieved documents. That means we are considering that approximation of a set of relevant documents. We can distinguish the results in four cases, depending on the situation of a document as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:basicmeasure}.

Naturally, we\nwill have to look at precision and recall at different cutoffs since a ranked\nlist of relevant documents is determined by where the user stops browsing. If we\nassume the user sequentially browses the list of results, the user would stop at\nsome point. That point would determine the size of the set. Therefore, that's\nthe most important cutoff that we have to consider when we compute the\nprecision-recall.\nWithout knowing where exactly the user would stop, we have to consider all the\npossible positions where they might stop. A \\textbf{precision-recall} curve does\nexactly this as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:prcurve}\nWhat if the user stops at the first document? What's the precision-recall at\nthis point? Since $D_1$ is relevant, the precision is one out of one since we\nhave one document and it is relevant. What about the recall? Note that we are\nassuming that there are ten relevant documents for this query in the collection\nso it's one out of ten.\nWhat if the user stops at the second position? The precision is the same since\nboth $D_1$ and $D_2$ are relevant: 100\\%, or two out of two. The recall is two\nout of ten, or 20\\%. If the user stops at the third position, we have an\ninteresting case because we don't have any additional relevant documents, so the\nrecall does not change. However, the precision is lower because we have two out\nof three relevant documents. The recall won't change until we see another\nrelevant document. In this case, that point is at $D_5$. There, the recall has\nincreased to three out of ten and the precision is three out of five. As you can\nsee, if we keep doing this, we can also get to $D_8$ and have a precision of\nfour out of eight, because there are eight documents and four of them are\nrelevant. There, the recall is four out of ten.\nWhen can we get a recall of five out of ten? In this list, we don't have it. For\nconvenience, we often assume that the precision is zero in a situation like\nthis. This is a pessimistic assumption since the actual position would be\nhigher, but we make this assumption in order to have an easy way to compute\nanother measure called \\emph{average precision}, that we will discuss soon.\nNote that we've made some assumptions that are clearly not accurate. But, this\nis okay for the relative comparison of two text retrieval methods. As long as\nthe deviation is not biased toward any particular retrieval method, the measure\nis acceptable since we can still accurately tell which method works better. This\nis the most important point to keep in mind: when you compare different\nalgorithms, the key is to avoid any bias toward a particular method. As long as\nyou can avoid that, it's perfectly fine to do a transformation of these measures\nthat preserves the order.\nSince we can get a lot of precision-recall numbers at different positions, we\ncan plot a curve; this is what's shown on the right side of\nFigure~\\ref{fig:prcurve}. On the $x$-axis are the recall values. On the $y$-axis\nare the precision values. We plot precision-recall numbers so that we display at\nwhat recall we can obtain a certain precision. Furthermore, we can link these\npoints to form a curve. As you see in the figure, we assumed all the precision\nvalues at the high-level recalls are zero. Although reals curves will be\nsomething like this, it doesn't matter that much for comparing two methods\nwhether we get the exact precision values here or not."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-10416781": 1, "wikipedia-1482394": 1, "wikipedia-48180751": 1, "wikipedia-37165004": 1, "wikipedia-41157359": 1, "wikipedia-25050663": 1, "wikipedia-28299520": 1, "wikipedia-43218024": 1, "wikipedia-62433": 1, "wikipedia-2636884": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/evaluation.jsonl/2": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/evaluation.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/ordinal.jsonl/7": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/sentiment-classification.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/issues.jsonl/3": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/web-search/learning.jsonl/7": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/4": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/lara.jsonl/9": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/categorization.jsonl/4": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-10416781": 1, "wikipedia-1482394": 1, "wikipedia-48180751": 1, "wikipedia-37165004": 1, "wikipedia-41157359": 1, "wikipedia-25050663": 1, "wikipedia-28299520": 1, "wikipedia-43218024": 1, "wikipedia-62433": 1, "wikipedia-2636884": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/evaluation.jsonl/2": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/evaluation.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/ordinal.jsonl/7": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/sentiment-classification.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/issues.jsonl/3": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/web-search/learning.jsonl/7": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/4": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/sentiment/lara.jsonl/9": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/categorization.jsonl/4": 1}}}

A specialized textbook on the relevant topic would likely address methods and algorithms for generating ranked lists (e.g., scoring, sorting, or prioritization techniques) as well as the detailed steps involved in a verification process.

Previously, we've discussed a number of ways to rank documents. We talked about some retrieval models like BM25 or query likelihood; these can generate a content-based scores for matching document text with a query. We also talked about the link-based approaches like PageRank that can give additional scores to help us improve ranking. The question now is how can we combine all these features (and potentially many other features) to do ranking? This will be very useful for ranking Web pages not only just to improve accuracy, but also to improve the robustness of the ranking function so that's it not easy for a spammer to just perturb one or a few features to promote a page. The general idea of learning to rank is to use machine learning to combine these features, optimizing the weight on different features to generate the best ranking function. We assume that given a query-document pair $(q,d)$, we can define a number of features. These features don't necessarily have to be content-based features. They could be a score of the document with respect to the query according to a retrieval function such as BM25, query likelihood, pivoted length normalization, PL2, \\emph{etc}. There also can be a link-based score like PageRank or HITS, or an application of retrieval models to the anchor text of the page, which are the descriptions of links that point to $d$. These can all be clues about whether this document is relevant or not to the query. We can even include a feature such as whether the URL has a tilde because this might indicate a home page. The question is, of course, how can we combine these features into a single score? In this approach, we simply hypothesize that the probability that this document is relevant to this query is a function of all these features. We hypothesize that the probability of relevance is related to these features through a particular function that has some parameters. These parameters control the influence of different features on the final relevance. This is, of course, just an assumption. Whether this assumption really makes sense is still an open research question. Naturally, the next question is how to estimate those parameters. How do we know which features should have high weight and which features should have low weight? This is a task of training or learning. In this approach, we use training data. This is data that have been judged by users, so we already know the relevance judgments. We know which documents should be highly-ranked for which queries, and this information can be based on real judgments by users or can be approximated by just using clickthrough information as we discussed in chapter~\\ref{chap:feedback}. We will try to optimize our search engine's retrieval accuracy (using \\eg, MAP or NDCG) on the training data by adjusting these parameters. The training data would look like a table of tuples. Each tuple has three elements: the query, the document, and the judgment. Let's take a look at a specific method that's based on regression: This is one of many different methods, and actually one of the simpler ones. In this approach, we simply assume the relevance of a document with respect to the query is related to a linear combination of all the features. Here we have $X_i$ to denote the $i^{th}$ feature value, and we can have as many features as we would like. We assume that these features can be combined in a linear manner. The weight of feature $X_i$ is controlled by a parameter $\\beta_i$. A larger $\\beta_i$ would mean the feature would have a higher weight and it would contribute more to the scoring function. The specific form of the function also involves a transformation of the probability of relevance: We know that the probability of relevance is within the range $[0,1]$ and we assume that the scoring function is related to this linear combination. We could have done a simple linear combination of $\\beta$ and $X$, but then the value of this linear combination could easily go beyond $1$. Thus the reason why we have the second formula is to map this transformation onto the range $[0,1]$. This allows us to connect the probability of relevance (which is between $0$ and $1$) to a linear combination of arbitrary coefficients. If we rewrite this combination of weights into a probability function, we will get the predicted score."], "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/vs-models.jsonl/27": ["In this section, we will discuss how to instantiate a vector space model so that we can get a very specific ranking function. As mentioned previously, the vector space model is really a framework: it doesn't specify many things. For example, it did not say how we should define the dimensions of the vectors. It also did not say how we place a document vector or query vector into this space. That is, how should we define/calculate the values of all the elements in the query and document vectors? Finally, it did not say how we should compute similarity between the query vector and the document vector. As you can imagine, in order to implement this model, we have to determine specifically how we should compute and use these vectors. In Figure~\\ref{fig:bitvector}, we illustrate the simplest instantiation of the vector space model. In this instantiation, we use each word in our vocabulary to define a dimension, thus giving $|V|$ dimensions---this is the bag-of-words instantiation. Now let's look at how we place vectors in this space. Here, the simplest strategy is to use a bit vector to represent both a query and a document, and that means each element $x_i$ and $y_i$ would take a value of either zero or one. When it's one, it means the corresponding word is present in the document or query. When it's zero, it's absent. If the user types in a few words for a query, then the query vector would have a few ones and many, many zeros. The document vector in general would have more ones than the query vector, but there will still be many zeros since the vocabulary is often very large. Many words in the vocabulary don't occur in a single document; many words will only occasionally occur in a given document. Most words in the vocabulary will be absent in any particular document. Now that we have placed the documents and the query in the vector space, let's look at how we compute the similarity between them. A commonly used similarity measure is the dot product; the dot product of two vectors is simply defined as the sum of the products of the corresponding elements of the two vectors as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:bitvector}. Of course, the dot product is only one of the many different ways of computing the similarity. With a specific definition of the dimensions, the vector space, and the similarity function; we finally have the simplest instantiation of the vector space model! It's based on the bit vector representation, dot product similarity, and bag of words instantiation. Now we can finally implement this ranking function using a programming language and then rank documents in our corpus given a particular query."], "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/vs-models.jsonl/28": ["In the vector space model, we want to first compute the vectors for these documents and the query. The query has four words, so its vector representation would have a one for each of these four words, and zero for all the other words. Document $d_1$ has two ones, \\emph{news} and \\emph{about}, while the rest of the dimensions are zeros. Now that we have the two vectors, we can compute the similarity with the dot product by multiplying the corresponding elements in each vector. Each pair of vectors forms a product, which represents the similarity between the two vectors. We actually don't have to care about the zeroes in each vector since any product involving them would be zero. So, when we take a sum over all these pairs, we're just counting how many pairs of ones there are. In this case, there are two, so the result will be two. That means this number is the value of this scoring function; it's simply the count of how many unique query terms are matched in the document. This is how we interpret the score. Now we can also take a look at $d_3$. In this case, you can see the result is three because $d_3$ matched the three distinct query words \\emph{news}, \\emph{presidential}, and \\emph{campaign}, whereas $d_1$ only matched two. Based on this, $d_3$ is ranked above $d_1. In Figure~\\ref{fig:bitvectorrank}, we show all the scores for these five documents. The bit vector scoring function counts the number of unique query terms matched in each document. If a document matches more unique query terms, then the document will be assumed to be more relevant."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

These approaches have been notoriously politicized and inaccurate reflections of actual prestige and quality, as they would often reflect the biases and personal career objectives of those involved in ranking the journals; also causing the problem of highly disparate evaluations across institutions. Consequently, many institutions have required external sources of evaluation of journal quality. The traditional approach here has been through surveys of leading academics in a given field, but this approach too has potential for bias, though not as profound as that seen with institution-generated lists. Consequently, governments, institutions, and leaders in scientometric research have turned to a litany of observed bibliometric measures on the journal-level that can be used as surrogates for quality and thus eliminate the need for subjective assessment.\n\nConsequently, several journal-level metrics have been proposed, most citation-based:\n- Impact factor \u2013 Reflecting the average number of citations to articles published in science and social science journals.\n- Eigenfactor \u2013 A rating of the total importance of a scientific journal according to the number of incoming citations, with citations from highly ranked journals weighted to make a larger contribution to the eigenfactor than those from poorly ranked journals.\n- SCImago Journal Rank \u2013 A measure of scientific influence of scholarly journals that accounts for both the number of citations received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations come from.\n- h-index \u2013 Usually used as a measure of scientific productivity and the scientific impact of an individual scientist, but can also be used to rank journals.\n- Expert survey \u2013 A score reflecting the overall quality or contribution of a journal is based on the results of the survey of active field researchers, practitioners and students (i.e., actual journal contributors or readers), who rank each journal based on specific criteria.\n- Publication power approach (PPA) \u2013 The ranking position of each journal is based on the actual publishing behavior of leading tenured academics over an extended time period.

For systems that return a ranked sequence of documents, it is desirable to also consider the order in which the returned documents are presented. By computing a precision and recall at every position in the ranked sequence of documents, one can plot a precision-recall curve, plotting precision formula_21 as a function of recall formula_22. Average precision computes the average value of formula_21 over the interval from formula_24 to formula_25: That is the area under the precision-recall curve. This integral is in practice replaced with a finite sum over every position in the ranked sequence of documents: where formula_28 is the rank in the sequence of retrieved documents, formula_29 is the number of retrieved documents, formula_30 is the precision at cut-off formula_28 in the list, and formula_32 is the change in recall from items formula_33 to formula_28. This finite sum is equivalent to: where formula_36 is an indicator function equaling 1 if the item at rank formula_28 is a relevant document, zero otherwise. Note that the average is over all relevant documents and the relevant documents not retrieved get a precision score of zero. Some authors choose to interpolate the formula_21 function to reduce the impact of \"wiggles\" in the curve.

Therefore, that's\nthe most important cutoff that we have to consider when we compute the\nprecision-recall.\nWithout knowing where exactly the user would stop, we have to consider all the\npossible positions where they might stop. A \\textbf{precision-recall} curve does\nexactly this as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:prcurve}\nWhat if the user stops at the first document? What's the precision-recall at\nthis point?

Previously, we've discussed a number of ways to rank documents. We talked about some retrieval models like BM25 or query likelihood; these can generate a content-based scores for matching document text with a query. We also talked about the link-based approaches like PageRank that can give additional scores to help us improve ranking. The question now is how can we combine all these features (and potentially many other features) to do ranking? This will be very useful for ranking Web pages not only just to improve accuracy, but also to improve the robustness of the ranking function so that's it not easy for a spammer to just perturb one or a few features to promote a page. The general idea of learning to rank is to use machine learning to combine these features, optimizing the weight on different features to generate the best ranking function. We assume that given a query-document pair $(q,d)$, we can define a number of features. These features don't necessarily have to be content-based features. They could be a score of the document with respect to the query according to a retrieval function such as BM25, query likelihood, pivoted length normalization, PL2, \\emph{etc}. There also can be a link-based score like PageRank or HITS, or an application of retrieval models to the anchor text of the page, which are the descriptions of links that point to $d$. These can all be clues about whether this document is relevant or not to the query. We can even include a feature such as whether the URL has a tilde because this might indicate a home page. The question is, of course, how can we combine these features into a single score? In this approach, we simply hypothesize that the probability that this document is relevant to this query is a function of all these features. We hypothesize that the probability of relevance is related to these features through a particular function that has some parameters. These parameters control the influence of different features on the final relevance. This is, of course, just an assumption. Whether this assumption really makes sense is still an open research question. Naturally, the next question is how to estimate those parameters. How do we know which features should have high weight and which features should have low weight? This is a task of training or learning. In this approach, we use training data. This is data that have been judged by users, so we already know the relevance judgments. We know which documents should be highly-ranked for which queries, and this information can be based on real judgments by users or can be approximated by just using clickthrough information as we discussed in chapter~\\ref{chap:feedback}.

With the new system, the points allocation is simpler: three points for a win, one point for a draw, and zero points for a loss, in line with most league systems around the world.\n\nIn the event of a match being decided by a penalty shootout, the winning team receives two points, and the losing team one point.\n\nDifferent matches have different importance to teams, and FIFA has tried to respect this by using a weighting system, where the most significant matches are in the World Cup finals, and the lowest weighted are friendly matches.

FIFA also stated, however, that it did not plan to make any adjustment for teams that qualify directly for major tournaments.\n\nThe match status multipliers are as follows:\n\nA win against a very highly ranked opponent is a considerably greater achievement than a win against a low-rated opponent, thus the strength of the opposing team is an important factor.\nThe new system uses an opposition strength factor based on team rankings.

The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or satisfaction within the theory of utilitarianism by moral philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. But the term has been adapted and reapplied within neoclassical economics, which dominates modern economic theory, as a utility function that represents a consumer's preference ordering over a choice set. As such, it is devoid of its original interpretation as a measurement of the pleasure or satisfaction obtained by the consumer from that choice.\n\nIn general economic terms, a utility function measures preferences concerning a set of goods and services. Often, utility is correlated with words such as happiness, satisfaction, and welfare, and these are hard to measure mathematically. Thus, economists utilize consumption baskets of preferences in order to measure these abstract, non quantifiable ideas.\n\nIt was recognized that utility could not be measured or observed directly, so instead economists devised a way to infer underlying relative utilities from observed choice. These 'revealed preferences', as they were named by Paul Samuelson, were revealed e.g. in people's willingness to pay: Utility is taken to be correlative to Desire or Want. It has been already argued that desires cannot be measured directly, but only indirectly, by the outward phenomena to which they give rise: and that in those cases with which economics is chiefly concerned the measure is found in the price which a person is willing to pay for the fulfillment or satisfaction of his desire.\n\nThere has been some controversy over the question whether the utility of a commodity can be measured or not. At one time, it was assumed that the consumer was able to say exactly how much utility he got from the commodity. The economists who made this assumption belonged to the 'cardinalist school' of economics. Today utility functions, expressing utility as a function of the amounts of the various goods consumed, are treated as either \"cardinal\" or \"ordinal\", depending on whether they are or are not interpreted as providing more information than simply the rank ordering of preferences over bundles of goods, such as information on the strength of preferences."], "wikipedia-49229254": ["Health utility values are commonly produced using HUI as a component of the quality-adjusted life years (QALY) calculation used in population health and economics.\n\nUsing Von Neumann-Morganstern utility theorem to measure a participants health status, health state responses for each attribute are converted to a standardized health utility value which is discussed in detail below.\n\nIn HUI, utility values range from -0.03 and -0.36 for the HUI-2 and HUI-3, respectively, to 1.00.

Therefore, the fall in marginal utility as consumption increases is known as diminishing marginal utility. Mathematically:\n\nMarginal utility can then be defined as the first derivative of total utility\u2014the total satisfaction obtained from consumption of a good or service\u2014with respect to the amount of consumption of that good or service.\n\nContemporary mainstream economic theory frequently defers metaphysical questions, and merely notes or assumes that preference structures conforming to certain rules can be usefully \"proxied\" by associating goods, services, or their uses with quantities, and \"defines\" \"utility\" as such a quantification.\n\nAnother conception is Benthamite philosophy, which equated usefulness with the production of pleasure and avoidance of pain, assumed subject to arithmetic operation.

Typically, this has been done via user studies---where human users interact with the corpus via the system. In this case, the measures we use all need to be correlated with the utility to the users. The measures only need to be good enough to determine which method works better. This is usually done by using a test collection, which is a main idea that we'll be talking about in this chapter. This has been very important for comparing different algorithms and for improving search engines systems in general."], "textbook/textdatabook/recommender-systems/content-based.jsonl/7": ["One common strategy is to use a utility function, and below is an example of a linear utility function:\nwhere $R$ is the set of relevant documents delivered to the user and $R'$ is the set of non-relevant documents delivered to the user (that the user rejected). In other words, we can treat this as a gambling game. If the system delivers one good item, let's say you win $\\$3$, or you gain $\\$3$. If you deliver a bad document, you would lose $\\$2$. This utility function measures how much money you would accumulate (or lose) by considering this kind of game. It's clear that if you want to maximize this utility function, your strategy should be to deliver as many good items as possible while simultaneously minimizing the delivery of bad items.\nOne interesting question here is how to set these coefficients. We just showed a $3$ and a $-2$ as the possible coefficients, but we can ask the question ``are they reasonable?'' What about other choices? We could have $10$ and $-1$, or $1$ and $-10$. How would these utility functions affect the system's output? If you think about it, you will see that while we get a big reward for delivering a good document, we incur only a small penalty for delivering a bad one. Intuitively, the system would be encouraged to deliver more documents, since delivering more documents gives a better chance of obtaining a high reward. If we choose $1$ and $-10$, it is the opposite case: we don't really get such a big prize if a good document is delivered, while a large loss is incurred if we deliver a bad one. The system in this case would be very reluctant to deliver many documents, and has to be absolutely sure that it's a non-relevant one.

To further improve the accuracy of a search engine, it's important to consider special cases of information need. One particular trend is to have more and more specialized and customized search engines, which can be called \\emph{vertical search engines}. These vertical search engines can be expected to be more effective than the current general search engines because they could assume that a particular user belongs to a special group that might have a common information need. \n\nAnother trend we can expect to see is search engines that are able to learn over time, a form of lifetime learning or lifelong learning. This is very attractive because that means the search engine will be able to self-improve. As more people use it, the search engine will become better and better. This is already happening, because the search engines can learn from the relevance feedback. More users use it, and the quality of the search engine allows for the popular queries that are typed in by many users to retrieve better results.\n\nA third trend might be the integration of information access. Search, navigation, and recommendation might be combined to form a full-fledged information management system. In the beginning of this book, we talked about push access versus pull access; these modes can be combined. For example, if a search engine detects that a user is unsatisfied with search results, a ``note'' may be made. In the future, if a new document is crawled that matches the user's information need recorded in the note, this new document could be pushed to the user. Currently, most of the cases of information recommendation are advertising, but in the future, you can imagine recommendation is seamlessly integrated into the system with multi-mode information access.\n\nOn the top of Figure~\\ref{fig:dus}, there are different kinds of users. On the left side, there are different types of data or information, and on the bottom, there are different service functions. Now imagine you can connect all these in different ways. For example, if you connect everyone with Web pages, and support search and browsing, you get Web search. If we connect university employees with organization documents or enterprise documents and support the search and browsing, we get enterprise search. \nWe could connect scientists with literature information to provide all kinds of services including search, browsing, alert to new relevant documents, mining or analyzing research trends, or task and decision support. For example, we might be able to provide support for automatically generating a related works section for a research paper; this would be closer to task support. Then, we can imagine this intelligent information system would be a type of literature assistant. \nIf we connect online shoppers with blog articles or product reviews, then we can help these people improve their shopping experience.

We can also have a sample set of queries or topics that simulate the user's information need. Then, we need to have \textbf{relevance judgments}. These are judgments of which documents should be returned for which queries. Ideally, they have to be made by users who formulated the queries because those are the people that know exactly what the documents (search results) would be used for. Finally, we have to have measures to quantify how well a system's result matches the ideal ranked list. These would be constructed and based on users' relevance judgements. [...] Once we have these judgements, we can compare two or more systems. Each query is run on each system, and we investigate the documents that each system returns. Let's say the query is $Q_1$. In the figure we have $R_A$ as ranked results from system A and $R_B$ as the ranked results from system B. Thus $R_A$ is system A's approximation of relevant documents and $R_B$ is system B's approximation. Let's take a look at these results---which is better? As a user, which one would you like? There are some differences and there are some documents that are returned by both systems. But if you look at the results you will feel that maybe system A is better in the sense that we don't have that many documents returned, and among the three documents returned two of them are relevant. That's good; system A is precise. On the other hand, we can also say system B is better because it returned \\emph{more} relevant documents; it returned three instead of two. So which one is better and how do we quantify this? This question highly depends on a user's task, and it depends on the individual users as well! For some users, maybe system A is better if the user is not interested in getting all the relevant documents so he or she doesn't have to read too much. On the other hand, imagine a user might need to have as many relevant documents as possible, for example, in writing a literature survey. You might be in the second category, and then you might find that system B is better. In either case, we'll have to also define measures that would quantify the information need of a user."], "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/vs-models.jsonl/24": ["First, one family of the models are based on the similarity idea. Basically, we assume that if a document is more similar to the query than another document is, we would say the first document is more relevant than the second one. So in this case, the ranking function is defined as the similarity between the query and the document. One well-known example of this case is the \\textbf{vector space model} \\cite{VSM}, which we will cover more in detail later in this chapter. The second set of models are called \\textbf{probabilistic retrieval models} \\cite{Lafferty:02}. In this family of models, we follow a very different strategy. We assume that queries and documents are all observations from random variables, and we assume there is a binary random variable called $R$ to indicate whether a document is relevant to a query. We then define the score of a document with respect to a query as the probability that this random variable $R$ is equal to 1 given a particular document and query. There are different cases of such a general idea. One is the classic probabilistic model, which dated back to work done in 1960s and 1970s \\cite{Maron:60,Robertson:76}, another is the language modeling approach \\cite{Ponte:98}, and yet another is the divergence-from-randomness model \\cite{Amati:02}. We will cover a particular language modeling approach called query likelihood retrieval model in detail later in this chapter. One of the most effective retrieval models derived from the classific probabilistic retrieval framework is BM25\\cite{Robertson:09}, but since the retrieval function of BM25 is so similar to a vector space retrieval model, we have chosen to cover it as a variant of the vector space model. The third kind of model is probabilistic inference \\cite{Turtle:89}. Here the idea is to associate uncertainty to inference rules. We can then quantify the probability that we can show that the query follows from the document. This family of models is theoretically appealing, but in practice, they are often reduced to models essentially similar to vector-space model or a regular probabilistic retrieval model. Finally, there is also a family of models that use axiomatic thinking \\cite{Fang:11}. The idea is to define a set of constraints that we hope a good retrieval function satisfies. In this case the problem is to find a good ranking function that can satisfy all the desired constraints. Interestingly, although all these models are based on different thinking, in the end the retrieval functions tend to be very similar and involve similar variables."], "textbook/textdatabook/text-access-overview/vs-database.jsonl/0": ["It is useful to make a comparison of the problem of text retrieval and the similar problem of database retrieval. Both retrieval tasks are to help users find relevant information, but due to the difference in the data managed by these two tasks, there are many important differences. First, the data managed by a search engine and a database system are different. In databases, the data are {\\em structured} where each field has a clearly defined meaning according to a schema. Thus the data can be viewed as a table with well-specified columns. For example, in a bank database system, one field may be customer names, another may be the address, and yet another may be the balance of each type of account. In contrast, the data managed by a search engine are {\\em unstructured} text which can be difficult for computers to understand. Thus even if a sentence says a person lives in a particular address, it remains difficult for the computer to answer a query about the address of a person in response to a keyword query since there is no simple defined structure to free text. Thus structured data are often easier to manage and analyze since they conform to a clearly defined schema where the meaning of each field is well defined. Second, a consequence of the difference in the data is that the queries that can be supported by the two are also different. A database query clearly specifies the constraints on the fields of the data table, and thus the expected retrieval results (answers to the query) are very well specified with no ambiguity. In a search engine, however, the queries are generally keyword queries, which are only a vague specification of what documents should be returned. Even if the computer can fully understand the semantics of natural language text, it is still often the case that the user's information need is vague due to the lack of complete knowledge about the information to be found (which is often the reason why the user wants to find the information in the first place!). For example, in the case of searching for relevant literature to a research problem, the user is unlikely able to clearly and completely specify which documents should be returned. Finally, the expected results in the two applications are also different. In database search, we can retrieve very specific data elements (e.g., specific columns); in text retrieval, we are generally only able to retrieve a set of relevant documents. With passages or fields identified in a text document, a search engine can also retrieve passages, but it is generally difficult to retrieve specific entities or attribute values as we can in a database."], "textbook/textdatabook/text-analysis-overview/text-analysis-overview.jsonl/0": ["Text retrieval using search engines is necessary to extract from big text data a much smaller but more relevant text data pool.

The infrastructure required for a search engine is already available in the form of thousands of idle desktops and extensive residential broadband access.\nDespite of the advantages of distributed search, it shares several same security concerns as the traditionally centralized case. The security concerns can be classified into three categories: data privacy, data integrity and secure social search. Data privacy protection is defined as the way users can fully control their data and manage its accessibility. The solutions for data privacy include information substitution, attributed based encryption and identity based broadcast encryption. The data integrity is defined as the protection of data from unauthorized or improper modifications and deletions. The solutions for data integrity are digital signature, hash chaining and embedded signing key. The solutions for secure social search are blind signature, zero knowledge proof and resource handler.\nAnother issue related to both distributed and centralized search is how to more accurately understand user intent from observed multimedia data. The solutions are based on how to effectively and efficiently leverage social media and search engine. A potential method is to derive a user-image interest graph from social media, and then re-rank image search results by integrating social relevance from the user-image interest graph and visual relevance from general search engines.\nBesides above engineering explorations, a more fundamental and potential method is to develop social search systems based on the understanding of related neural mechanisms.

One is the classic probabilistic model, which dated back to work done in 1960s and 1970s \\cite{Maron:60,Robertson:76}, another is the language modeling approach \\cite{Ponte:98}, and yet another is the divergence-from-randomness model \\cite{Amati:02}. We will cover a particular language modeling approach called query likelihood retrieval model in detail later in this chapter. One of the most effective retrieval models derived from the classific probabilistic retrieval framework is BM25\\cite{Robertson:09}, but since the retrieval function of BM25 is so similar to a vector space retrieval model, we have chosen to cover it as a variant of the vector space model. The third kind of model is probabilistic inference \\cite{Turtle:89}. Here the idea is to associate uncertainty to inference rules. We can then quantify the probability that we can show that the query follows from the document. This family of models is theoretically appealing, but in practice, they are often reduced to models essentially similar to vector-space model or a regular probabilistic retrieval model. Finally, there is also a family of models that use axiomatic thinking \\cite{Fang:11}. The idea is to define a set of constraints that we hope a good retrieval function satisfies. In this case the problem is to find a good ranking function that can satisfy all the desired constraints. Interestingly, although all these models are based on different thinking, in the end the retrieval functions tend to be very similar and involve similar variables. The axiomatic retrieval framework has proven effective for diagnosing deficiencies of a retrieval model and developing improved retrieval models accordingly (e.g., BM25+ \\cite{bm25-plus})."], "textbook/textdatabook/text-access-overview/vs-database.jsonl/0": ["It is useful to make a comparison of the problem of text retrieval and the\nsimilar problem of database retrieval. Both retrieval tasks are to help users\nfind relevant information, but due to the difference in the data managed by\nthese two tasks, there are many important differences.\nFirst, the data managed by a search engine and a database system are different.\nIn databases, the data are {\\em structured} where each field has a clearly\ndefined meaning according to a schema. Thus the data can be viewed as a table\nwith well-specified columns. For example, in a bank database system, one field\nmay be customer names, another may be the address, and yet another may be the\nbalance of each type of account. In contrast, the data managed by a search\nengine are {\\em unstructured} text which can be difficult for computers to\nunderstand \footnote{Although common parlance refers to text as\nunstructured with a meaningful contrast with relational database\nstructuring, it employs a narrow sense\nof ``structure.'' For example, from a linguistics perspective, grammar\nprovides well-defined structure. To study this matter further, see the 5S\n(societies, scenarios, spaces, structures, and streams) works by Fox et al. \\cite{fox5s}}. Thus even if a sentence says a person lives in a particular address,\nit remains difficult for the computer to answer a query about the address of a\nperson in response to a keyword query since there is no simple defined structure\nto free text. Thus\nstructured data are often\neasier to manage and analyze since they conform to a clearly defined schema\nwhere the meaning of each field is well defined.\nSecond, a consequence of the difference in the data is that the queries that can\nbe supported by the two are also different. A database query clearly specifies\nthe constraints on the fields of the data table, and thus the expected retrieval\nresults (answers to the query) are very well specified with no ambiguity. In a\nsearch engine, however, the queries are generally keyword queries, which are\nonly a vague specification of what documents should be returned. Even if the\ncomputer can fully understand the semantics of natural language text, it is\nstill often the case that the user's information need is vague due to the lack\nof complete knowledge about the information to be found (which is often the\nreason why the user wants to find the information in the first place!). For\nexample, in the case of searching for relevant literature to a research problem,\nthe user is unlikely able to clearly and completely specify which documents\nshould be returned.\nFinally, the expected results in the two applications are also different. In\ndatabase search, we can retrieve very specific data elements (\\eg, specific\ncolumns); in text retrieval, we are generally only able to retrieve a set of\nrelevant documents. With passages or fields identified in a text document, a\nsearch engine can also retrieve passages, but it is generally difficult to\nretrieve specific entities or attribute values as we can in a database. This\ndifference is not as essential as the difference in the vague specification of\nwhat exactly is the ``correct'' answer to a query, but is a direct consequence\nof the vague information need in text retrieval.\nDue to these differences, the challenges in building a useful database and a\nuseful search engine are also somewhat different. In databases, since what items\nshould be returned is clearly specified, there is no challenge in determining\nwhich data elements satisfy the user's query and thus should be returned; a\nmajor remaining challenge is how to find the answers as quickly as possible\nespecially when there are many queries being issued at the same time. While the\nefficiency challenge also exists in a search engine, a more important challenge\nthere is to first figure out which documents should be returned for a query\nbefore worrying about how to return the answers quickly. \nIn database\napplications---at least traditional database applications---it is also very\nimportant to maintain the integrity of the data; that is, to ensure no\ninconsistency occurs due to power failure. In text retrieval, modeling a user's\ninformation need and search tasks is important, again due to the difficulty for\na user to clearly specify information needs and the difficulty in NLP\\@.\nSince what counts as\nthe best answer to a query depends on the user, in text retrieval, the user is\nactually part of our input (together with the query, and document set). Thus\nthere is no mathematical way to prove that one answer is better than another or\nprove one method is better than another. Instead, we always have to rely on\nempirical evaluation using some test collections and users.  \nIn contrast, in database\nresearch, since the main issue is efficiency, one can prove one algorithm is\nbetter than another by analyzing the computational"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-13619555": 1, "wikipedia-41829011": 1, "wikipedia-12394086": 1, "wikipedia-19778769": 1, "wikipedia-13200719": 1, "wikipedia-27454991": 1, "wikipedia-12101316": 1, "wikipedia-49939362": 1, "wikipedia-6843345": 2, "wikipedia-35130341": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/text-access-overview/exercises.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/web-search/future.jsonl/2": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/4": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/vs-models.jsonl/24": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/text-access-overview/vs-database.jsonl/0": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/text-analysis-overview/text-analysis-overview.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/web-search/indexing.jsonl/7": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/recommender-systems/exercises.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/clustering/evaluation.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/clustering/clustering.jsonl/1": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-13619555": 1, "wikipedia-41829011": 1, "wikipedia-12394086": 2, "wikipedia-19778769": 1, "wikipedia-13200719": 1, "wikipedia-27454991": 1, "wikipedia-12101316": 2, "wikipedia-49939362": 1, "wikipedia-6843345": 3, "wikipedia-35130341": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/text-access-overview/exercises.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/web-search/future.jsonl/2": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/4": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/vs-models.jsonl/24": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/text-access-overview/vs-database.jsonl/0": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/text-analysis-overview/text-analysis-overview.jsonl/0": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/web-search/indexing.jsonl/7": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/recommender-systems/exercises.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/clustering/evaluation.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/clustering/clustering.jsonl/1": 1}}}

Such an estimate is intuitively inaccurate even though it maximizes the probability of the observed two data points. This problem of ``overfitting'' can be addressed and alleviated by considering the uncertainty on the parameter and using Bayesian parameter estimation instead of MLE. In Bayesian parameter estimation, we consider a distribution over all the possible values for the parameter; that is, we treat the parameter itself as a random variable. Specifically, we may use $p(\\theta)$ to represent a distribution over all possible values for $\\theta$, which encodes our prior belief about what value is the true value of $\\theta$, while the data $D$ provide evidence for or against that belief. The prior belief $p(\\theta)$ can then be updated based on the observed evidence.

To more appropriately evaluate such a categorization task, we can examine the categorization performance for each category.

Well, the difference is just that---in the low level of recall, system B is better, but in the high recall region, system A is better. That means it depends on whether the user cares about high recall, or low recall with high precision. Imagine someone is just going to check out what's happening today and wants to find out something relevant in the news. Which system is better for that task? In this case, system B is better because the user is unlikely to examine many results; \\ie, the user doesn't care about high recall, only the first few results being useful. On the other hand, if a user wants to determine whether an idea has been thought of before, they will want to emphasize high recall so that they see as many relevant documents as possible and don't miss the chance to find the idea. Therefore, those users would favor system A."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/3": ["Intuitively we thought that system A is better because it did not have much noise. In particular we have seen, out of three results, two are relevant. On the other hand, in System B we have five results and only three of them are relevant. Based on this, it looks like system A is more \\emph{accurate}. This can be captured by the measure of \\textbf{precision}, where we simply compute to what extent all the retrieval results are relevant. One hundred percent precision that would mean all the retrieved documents are relevant. Thus in this case, system A has a precision of $\\frac{2}{3}=0.6\\overline{6}$. System B has $\\frac{3}{5}=0.60$. This shows that system A is better according to precision. But we also mentioned that system B might be preferred by some other users who wish to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible. So, in that case we have to compare the number of total relevant documents to the number that is actually retrieved. This is captured in another measure called \\textbf{recall}, which measures the completeness of coverage of relevant documents in your retrieval result. We assume that there are ten relevant documents in the collection. Here we've got two of them from system A, so the recall is $\\frac{2}{10}=0.20$. System B has $\\frac{3}{10}=0.30$. Therefore, system B is better according to recall."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/issues.jsonl/3": ["Figure~\\ref{fig:statsig} displays some sample average precision results from system A and system B in two different experiments. As you can see in the bottom of the figure, we have the MAP for each system in each experiment. They happen to be identical in experiment one and two. Yet if you look at the exact average precisions for different queries, you will realize that in one case you might feel that you can trust the conclusion here given by the average. In the other case, you might not feel as confident. Based on only the MAP score, we can easily say that system B is better. After all, it's 0.4, which is twice as much as 0.2. Clearly, that's better performance. But if you look at these two experiments and look at the detailed results, you will see that we'll be more confident to say that in experiment one that system B is in fact better since the average precisions are \\emph{consistently} better than system A's. In experiment two, we're not sure that system B is better since the scores fluctuate so wildly. Intuitively, we feel it's better than A since the scores are more consistent.\nHow can we quantitatively answer this question? This is why we need to do a statistical significance test. The idea behind these tests is to assess the variance in average precision scores (or any other score) across these different queries. If there's a big variance, that means that the results could fluctuate according to different queries, which makes the result unreliable.\nSo let's look at these results again in the second case. In Figure~\\ref{fig:stattest}, we show two different ways to compare them. One is a \\textbf{sign test}. If system B is better than system A, then we have a plus sign. If system A is better, we have a minus sign. Using this, we have four cases where system B is better and three cases where system A is better. Intuitively, these results appear random. If you flip seven coins, using plus to denote heads and minus to denote tails, then these could easily be the results of just randomly flipping the seven coins. The fact that the average is larger doesn't tell us anything! This intuition can be quantified by the concept of a $p$ value. A $p$ value is the probability that this result is in fact from random fluctuation.

One main reason for this is self selection bias. People select themselves to participate in a program. For example, in a job training program, some people decide to participate and others do not. Those who do participate may differ from those who do not in important ways. They may be more determined to find a job or have better support resources.

Only if outcome measures are valid, reliable and appropriately sensitive can impact assessments be regarded as credible'.\n\nThe reliability of a measurement instrument is the 'extent to which the measure produces the same results when used repeatedly to measure the same thing' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 218). The more reliable a measure is, the greater its statistical power and the more credible its findings. If a measuring instrument is unreliable, it may dilute and obscure the real effects of a program, and the program will 'appear to be less effective than it actually is' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 219). Hence, it is important to ensure the evaluation is as reliable as possible.\n\nThe validity of a measurement instrument is 'the extent to which it measures what it is intended to measure' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 219). This concept can be difficult to accurately measure: in general use in evaluations, an instrument may be deemed valid if accepted as valid by the stakeholders (stakeholders may include, for example, funders, program administrators, et cetera).\n\nThe principal purpose of the evaluation process is to measure whether the program has an effect on the social problem it seeks to redress; hence, the measurement instrument must be sensitive enough to discern these potential changes (Rossi et al., 2004). A measurement instrument may be insensitive if it contains items measuring outcomes which the program couldn't possibly effect, or if the instrument was originally developed for applications to individuals (for example standardized psychological measures) rather than to a group setting (Rossi et al., 2004). These factors may result in 'noise' which may obscure any effect the program may have had.\n\nOnly measures which adequately achieve the benchmarks of reliability, validity and sensitivity can be said to be credible evaluations. It is the duty of evaluators to produce credible evaluations, as their findings may have far reaching effects.

There are two main reasons; the first is that we have to use evaluation to figure out which retrieval method works the best. This is very important for advancing our knowledge, otherwise we wouldn't know whether a new idea works better than an old idea. Previously in this book (chapter~\\ref{chap:retrieval-models}), we discussed the problem of text retrieval and compared it with database retrieval. Search engine evaluation must rely on users, so this becomes a very challenging problem. Because of this, we must determine how we can get users involved and draw a fair comparison of different methods. The second reason to perform evaluation is to assess the actual utility of an overall text retrieval system (as opposed to specific methods). Imagine you're building your own applications; you would be interested in knowing how well your search engine works for your users. In this case, measures must reflect the utility to the actual users in the real application as opposed to measures on each individual retrieval result. Typically, this has been done via user studies---where human users interact with the corpus via the system. In this case, the measures we use all need to be correlated with the utility to the users. The measures only need to be good enough to determine which method works better. This is usually done by using a test collection, which is a main idea that we'll be talking about in this chapter. This has been very important for comparing different algorithms and for improving search engines systems in general."], "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/evaluation.jsonl/2": ["As with information retrieval evaluation, we can use precision, recall, and $F_1$ score by considering true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. We are also usually concerned about accuracy, which is defined as the number of correct categorization decisions made by the system divided by the total number of categorization decisions made by the system. Since the accuracy measure does not distinguish different types of categorization errors, it is not appropriate to use it on a data set that has skewed distributions of instances in different classes. For example, in a binary categorization problem, if one category is much more popular than the other, than a trivial baseline that simply puts all instances in the category would have a pretty high categorization accuracy. To more appropriately evaluate such a categorization task, we can examine the categorization performance for each category. For example, we may treat the categorization results for each category as ``retrieval'' results for a query corresponding to the category and apply typical measures used in retrieval such as precision, recall and F measure to quantify the performance in a per-category manner. Readers can find more discussion about this in the reference \\cite{Yang:99}. The purpose of the development set is to prevent \\textbf{overfitting}, or tailoring the learning algorithm too much to a particular corpus subset and losing generality. A trained model is \\textbf{robust} if it is not prone to overfitting. Another evaluation paradigm is $n$-fold \\textbf{cross validation}. This splits the corpus into $n$ partitions. In $n$ rounds, one partition is selected as the testing set and the remaining $n-1$ are used for training. The final accuracy, $F_1$ score, or any other evaluation metric is then averaged over the $n$ folds. The variance in scores between the folds can be a hint at the overfitting potential of your algorithm. If the variance is high, it means that the accuracies are not very similar between folds. Having one fold with a very high accuracy suggests that your learning algorithm may have overfit during that training stage; when using that trained algorithm on a separate corpus, it's likely that the accuracy would be very low since it modeled noise or other uninformative features from that particular split (\\ie, it overfit). Another important concept is \\textbf{baseline accuracy}. This represents the minimum score to ``beat'' when using your classifier. Say there are 3000 documents consisting of three classes, each with 1000 documents. In this case, random guessing would give you about $33\\%$ accuracy, since you'd be correct approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the time. Your classifier would have to do better than $33\\%$ accuracy in order to make it useful! In another example, consider the 3000 documents and three classes, but with an uneven class distribution: one class has 2000 documents and the other two classes have 500 each. In this case, the baseline accuracy is $66\\%$, since picking the majority class label will result in correct predictions $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the time.

This is a real problem that you might actually have to face. Suppose you build a search engine and you have an old algorithm that's shown here in blue as system B. Then, you have come up with a new idea and test it with results shown in red as system A. The question is, is your new method better than the old method? Or, more practically, do you have to replace the algorithm that you're already using in your search engine with another new algorithm? If you make the replacement, the search engine would behave like system A here, whereas if you don't do that, it will be like system B. Now, some users might like system A, while some users might like system B. So what's the difference here? Well, the difference is just that---in the low level of recall, system B is better, but in the high recall region, system A is better. That means it depends on whether the user cares about high recall, or low recall with high precision. Imagine someone is just going to check out what's happening today and wants to find out something relevant in the news. Which system is better for that task? In this case, system B is better because the user is unlikely to examine many results; \\ie, the user doesn't care about high recall, only the first few results being useful. On the other hand, if a user wants to determine whether an idea has been thought of before, they will want to emphasize high recall so that they see as many relevant documents as possible and don't miss the chance to find the idea. Therefore, those users would favor system A.

How do we evaluate a new system using these judgements? We can't use average precision since it only operates on binary relevance values; if we treat level two and three as only one level, then we lose the information gained from comparing these two categories. MAP, gMAP, and MRR depend on average precision, so we can't use them either.\nLet's look at the top relevant results when using these judgments. We imagine the user would mostly care about the top ten results. We call these multi-level judgements ``gains'', since they roughly correspond to how much information a user \\emph{gains} when viewing a document. Looking at the first document, the user can gain three points; looking at the non-relevant documents, the user would only gain one point. This gain usually matches the utility of a document from a user's perspective. If we assume the user stops at ten documents we can cumulatively sum the information gain from traversing the list of returned documents. Let $r_i$ be the gain of result $i$, and let $i$ range from one to $n$, where we set $n$ to ten in our example. We then have the \\textbf{cumulative gain} (CG) as\nIf the user looks at more documents, the cumulative gain is more. This is at the cost of spending more time to examine the list. Thus cumulative gain gives us some idea about how much total gain the user would have if the user examines all these documents.\nThere is one deficiency which is not considering the rank or position of each document. Looking at the CG sum, we know there is only one highly relevant document, one marginally relevant document, two non-relevant documents; we don't know where they are ranked in the list. Ideally, we want the two with gains of three to be ranked on the top. But how can we capture that intuition? The second three is not as good as the first three at the top. That means the contribution of gain from different documents has to be weighted by their position. The document at position one doesn't need to be discounted because you can assume that the user always sees this document, but the second one will be discounted a little bit because there's a small possibility that the user wouldn't notice it. We divide this gain by a weight based on the position in order to capture this position-based penalty. The \\textbf{discounted cumulative gain} does exactly this:\nEach document's gain is discounted by dividing by a logarithm of its position in the list. Thus, a lowly-ranked document would not contribute contribute as much gain as a highly-ranked document. That means if, for example, you switch the position of $D_5$ and $D_2$, then the overall DCG score would increase since $D_5$'s relevance score of three is discounted less by being close to the top.\nAt this point, we have a discounted cumulative gain for measuring the utility of a ranked list with multiple levels of judgment. We still need to do a little bit more in order to make this measure comparable across different queries. The idea here is \\textbf{normalized discounted cumulative gain}, or NDCG\\@:\nIt is simply DCG normalized by the ideal DCG (IDCG) for a particular query. The IDCG is the most relevant documents at the top, sorted in decreasing order of relevance. For example, imagine that we have nine documents in the whole collection rated three. Then, our ideal ranked list would have put all these nine documents on the very top. All this would be followed by a two, because that's the best we could do after we have run out of threes. Then, we can compute the DCG for this ideal ranked list. This becomes the denominator for NDCG in order to normalize our own DCG in the range $[0,1]$.

In databases, the data are {\\em structured} where each field has a clearly defined meaning according to a schema. Thus the data can be viewed as a table with well-specified columns. For example, in a bank database system, one field may be customer names, another may be the address, and yet another may be the balance of each type of account. In contrast, the data managed by a search engine are {\\em unstructured} text which can be difficult for computers to understand \footnote{Although common parlance refers to text as unstructured with a meaningful contrast with relational database structuring, it employs a narrow sense of ``structure.'' For example, from a linguistics perspective, grammar provides well-defined structure. To study this matter further, see the 5S (societies, scenarios, spaces, structures, and streams) works by Fox et al. \\cite{fox5s}}. Thus even if a sentence says a person lives in a particular address, it remains difficult for the computer to answer a query about the address of a person in response to a keyword query since there is no simple defined structure to free text. Thus structured data are often easier to manage and analyze since they conform to a clearly defined schema where the meaning of each field is well defined.\nSecond, a consequence of the difference in the data is that the queries that can be supported by the two are also different. A database query clearly specifies the constraints on the fields of the data table, and thus the expected retrieval results (answers to the query) are very well specified with no ambiguity. In a search engine, however, the queries are generally keyword queries, which are only a vague specification of what documents should be returned. Even if the computer can fully understand the semantics of natural language text, it is still often the case that the user's information need is vague due to the lack of complete knowledge about the information to be found (which is often the reason why the user wants to find the information in the first place!). For example, in the case of searching for relevant literature to a research problem, the user is unlikely able to clearly and completely specify which documents should be returned.\nFinally, the expected results in the two applications are also different. In database search, we can retrieve very specific data elements (\\eg, specific columns); in text retrieval, we are generally only able to retrieve a set of relevant documents. With passages or fields identified in a text document, a search engine can also retrieve passages, but it is generally difficult to retrieve specific entities or attribute values as we can in a database. This difference is not as essential as the difference in the vague specification of what exactly is the ``correct'' answer to a query, but is a direct consequence of the vague information need in text retrieval.\nDue to these differences, the challenges in building a useful database and a useful search engine are also somewhat different. In databases, since what items should be returned is clearly specified, there is no challenge in determining which data elements satisfy the user's query and thus should be returned; a major remaining challenge is how to find the answers as quickly as possible especially when there are many queries being issued at the same time. While the efficiency challenge also exists in a search engine, a more important challenge there is to first figure out which documents should be returned for a query before worrying about how to return the answers quickly."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/multi-level.jsonl/4": ["The difference is when we have multiple topics---if we don't do normalization, different topics will have different scales of DCG@."], "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/prob-models.jsonl/29": ["The difference here is that Dirichlet prior smoothing can capture document length normalization differently than Jelinek-Mercer smoothing."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Thus the data can be viewed as a table\nwith well-specified columns. For example, in a bank database system, one field\nmay be customer names, another may be the address, and yet another may be the\nbalance of each type of account. In contrast, the data managed by a search\nengine are {\\em unstructured} text which can be difficult for computers to\nunderstand \footnote{Although common parlance refers to text as\nunstructured with a meaningful contrast with relational database\nstructuring, it employs a narrow sense\nof ``structure.'' For example, from a linguistics perspective, grammar\nprovides well-defined structure. To study this matter further, see the 5S\n(societies, scenarios, spaces, structures, and streams) works by Fox et al. \\cite{fox5s}}. Thus even if a sentence says a person lives in a particular address,\nit remains difficult for the computer to answer a query about the address of a\nperson in response to a keyword query since there is no simple defined structure\nto free text. Thus\nstructured data are often\neasier to manage and analyze since they conform to a clearly defined schema\nwhere the meaning of each field is well defined.\nSecond, a consequence of the difference in the data is that the queries that can\nbe supported by the two are also different. A database query clearly specifies\nthe constraints on the fields of the data table, and thus the expected retrieval\nresults (answers to the query) are very well specified with no ambiguity. In a\nsearch engine, however, the queries are generally keyword queries, which are\nonly a vague specification of what documents should be returned. Even if the\ncomputer can fully understand the semantics of natural language text, it is\nstill often the case that the user's information need is vague due to the lack\nof complete knowledge about the information to be found (which is often the\nreason why the user wants to find the information in the first place!). For\nexample, in the case of searching for relevant literature to a research problem,\nthe user is unlikely able to clearly and completely specify which documents\nshould be returned.\nFinally, the expected results in the two applications are also different. In\ndatabase search, we can retrieve very specific data elements (\\eg, specific\ncolumns); in text retrieval, we are generally only able to retrieve a set of\nrelevant documents. With passages or fields identified in a text document, a\nsearch engine can also retrieve passages, but it is generally difficult to\nretrieve specific entities or attribute values as we can in a database.

Several evaluation methods, including personas, cognitive modeling, inspection, inquiry, prototyping, and testing methods may contribute to understanding potential users and their perceptions of how well the product or process works. Usability considerations, such as who the users are and their experience with similar systems must be examined. As part of understanding users, this knowledge must \"...be played against the tasks that the users will be expected to perform.\" This includes the analysis of what tasks the users will perform, which are most important, and what decisions the users will make while using your system. Designers must understand how cognitive and emotional characteristics of users will relate to a proposed system. One way to stress the importance of these issues in the designers' minds is to use personas, which are made-up representative users. See below for further discussion of personas. Another more expensive but more insightful method is to have a panel of potential users work closely with the design team from the early stages.\nSection::::Designing for usability.:Empirical measurement.\nTest the system early on, and test the system on real users using behavioral measurements. This includes testing the system for both learnability and usability. (See Evaluation Methods). It is important in this stage to use quantitative usability specifications such as time and errors to complete tasks and number of users to test, as well as examine performance and attitudes of the users testing the system. Finally, \"reviewing or demonstrating\" a system before the user tests it can result in misleading results. The emphasis of empirical measurement is on measurement, both informal and formal, which can be carried out through a variety of evaluation methods.\nSection::::Designing for usability.:Iterative design.\nIterative design is a design methodology based on a cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining a product or process. Based on the results of testing the most recent iteration of a design, changes and refinements are made. This process is intended to ultimately improve the quality and functionality of a design. In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented. The key requirements for Iterative Design are: identification of required changes, an ability to make changes, and a willingness to make changes. When a problem is encountered, there is no set method to determine the correct solution. Rather, there are empirical methods that can be used during system development or after the system is delivered, usually a more inopportune time. Ultimately, iterative design works towards meeting goals such as making the system user friendly, easy to use, easy to operate, simple, etc.\nSection::::Evaluation methods.\nThere are a variety of usability evaluation methods. Certain methods use data from users, while others rely on usability experts. There are usability evaluation methods for all stages of design and development, from product definition to final design modifications. When choosing a method, consider cost, time constraints, and appropriateness. For a brief overview of methods, see Comparison of usability evaluation methods or continue reading below.

These measures differ from one another by the variables they measure and by the variables excluded from measurements. The measurable variables in economics are quantity, quality and distribution. Excluding variables from measurement makes it possible to better focus the measurement on a given variable, yet, this means a more narrow approach.\n\nSection::::Physical measure.\nA physical measure can measure the quantity of a variable with unchanged quality. Using a physical measure provides that the quality of the measurement object has been specified and the quality remains homogeneous. If the presumed unchanged quality is not realized, the measurement gives results which are hard to interpret. In this case, the results are affected by changes in both quantity and quality but in which proportion is unknown. Values of the objects being measured are by no means related to the physical measures, hence, changes in prices do not affect the measurement results. Normally it is not possible to combine physical measures. They are best suited for narrow-focused measurements with neither quality nor value alterations. Therefore, physical measures are best for measuring the real process, and this is why they are used a lot as tools of operative management. Typical ratios in a real process are capacity, efficiencies, lead times, loads, faults, product and process characteristics, etc.\n\nSection::::Fixed-price value.\nA fixed-price value measure is used to measure changes in quality and quantity. True to its name, prices are kept fixed for a minimum of two measuring situations. For this reason, it is possible to define the changes in quality and quantity of a most varied and wide range of commodities, keeping apart the changes in income distribution. Fixed-price measures are suited for wide-ranging measurement because it is possible to combine different commodities based on their value. In a fixed-price measurement, a change in quality means that the relative quantities and relative prices of various commodities change. The best known applications of this are the productivity formula and the production function. The production function is always presented with fixed-price ratios, i.e., its variables, productivity and volume, are fixed-price values.\n\nSection::::Nominal price value.\nThe most common figures in measuring business are the figures because they can describe the profitability of business process. Variables in the nominal price measurement are quality, quantities and distribution (in form of product prices). There are no excluded variables. Nominal price measures of value are suited for measuring profitability and its components as well as the value of reserves. Return and costs in the loss and profit statement are typical examples of a nominal price.

The use of quantitative methods in writing center contexts leaves room for issues to arise, however, such as data being interpreted incorrectly to support the work of the writing center, or not choosing appropriate data to measure student success like ACT writing test scores or course grades in first-year composition courses. Some writing scholars endorse quantitative methods more thoroughly than others, and see them as most helpful when reframed in a postmodern epistemology since most writing center directors subscribe to a theory of epistemology that sees knowledge as constructed, tenuous, and relative.

One advantage of elimination of artifact standards is that inter-comparison of artifacts is no longer required. Another advantage would be that the loss or damage of the artifact standards would not disrupt the system of measures.\nThe next quality standard in the hierarchy is known as a \"secondary standard\".

Although the two words precision and accuracy can be synonymous in colloquial use, they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method.\nThe field of statistics, where the interpretation of measurements plays a central role, prefers to use the terms \"bias\" and \"variability\" instead of accuracy and precision: bias is the amount of inaccuracy and variability is the amount of imprecision.\nA measurement system can be accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate, neither, or both. For example, if an experiment contains a systematic error, then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy. The result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of results from the flawed experiment. Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision.\nA measurement system is considered \"valid\" if it is both \"accurate\" and \"precise\". Related terms include \"bias\" (non-random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable) and \"error\" (random variability).\nThe terminology is also applied to indirect measurements\u2014that is, values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data.\nIn addition to accuracy and precision, measurements may also have a measurement resolution, which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement.\nIn numerical analysis, accuracy is also the nearness of a calculation to the true value; while precision is the resolution of the representation, typically defined by the number of decimal or binary digits.\nIn military terms, accuracy refers primarily to the accuracy of fire (or \"justesse de tir\"), the precision of fire expressed by the closeness of a grouping of shots at and around the centre of the target."]}, "textbook/textdatabook": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The F score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall, where an F score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0."], "wikipedia-14343887": ["In pattern recognition, information retrieval and binary classification, precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, while recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances. Both precision and recall are therefore based on an understanding and measure of relevance.\n\nSuppose a computer program for recognizing dogs in photographs identifies 8 dogs in a picture containing 12 dogs and some cats. Of the 8 identified as dogs, 5 actually are dogs (true positives), while the rest are cats (false positives). The program's precision is 5/8 while its recall is 5/12. When a search engine returns 30 pages only 20 of which were relevant while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages, its precision is 20/30 = 2/3 while its recall is 20/60 = 1/3. So, in this case, precision is \"how useful the search results are\", and recall is \"how complete the results are\".\n\nIn simple terms, high precision means that an algorithm returned substantially more relevant results than irrelevant ones, while high recall means that an algorithm returned most of the relevant results.\n\nOften, there is an inverse relationship between precision and recall, where it is possible to increase one at the cost of reducing the other. Brain surgery provides an illustrative example of the tradeoff. Consider a brain surgeon tasked with removing a cancerous tumor from a patient\u2019s brain. The surgeon needs to remove all of the tumor cells since any remaining cancer cells will regenerate the tumor. Conversely, the surgeon must not remove healthy brain cells since that would leave the patient with impaired brain function. The surgeon may be more liberal in the area of the brain he removes to ensure he has extracted all the cancer cells. This decision increases recall but reduces precision. On the other hand, the surgeon may be more conservative in the brain he removes to ensure he extracts only cancer cells. This decision increases precision but reduces recall. That is to say, greater recall increases the chances of removing healthy cells (negative outcome) and increases the chances of removing all cancer cells (positive outcome). Greater precision decreases the chances of removing healthy cells (positive outcome) but also decreases the chances of removing all cancer cells (negative outcome).\n\nUsually, precision and recall scores are not discussed in isolation. Instead, either values for one measure are compared for a fixed level at the other measure (e.g. \"precision at a recall level of 0.75\") or both are combined into a single measure. Examples of measures that are a combination of precision and recall are the F-measure (the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall), or the Matthews correlation coefficient, which is a geometric mean of the chance-corrected variants: the regression coefficients Informedness (DeltaP') and Markedness (DeltaP). Accuracy is a weighted arithmetic mean of Precision and Inverse Precision (weighted by Bias) as well as a weighted arithmetic mean of Recall and Inverse Recall (weighted by Prevalence). Inverse Precision and Inverse Recall are simply the Precision and Recall of the inverse problem where positive and negative labels are exchanged (for both real classes and prediction labels). Recall and Inverse Recall, or equivalently true positive rate and false positive rate, are frequently plotted against each other as ROC curves and provide a principled mechanism to explore operating point tradeoffs."], "wikipedia-50716473": ["Section::::Offline metrics.:Precision.\nPrecision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are relevant to the user's information need.\nIn binary classification, precision is analogous to positive predictive value. Precision takes all retrieved documents into account. It can also be evaluated at a given cut-off rank, considering only the topmost results returned by the system. This measure is called \"precision at n\" or \"P@n\".\nNote that the meaning and usage of \"precision\" in the field of information retrieval differs from the definition of accuracy and precision within other branches of science and statistics.\n\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Recall.\nRecall is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved.\nIn binary classification, recall is often called sensitivity. So it can be looked at as \"the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query\".\nIt is trivial to achieve recall of 100% by returning all documents in response to any query. Therefore, recall alone is not enough but one needs to measure the number of non-relevant documents also, for example by computing the precision.\n\nSection::::Offline metrics.:F-score / F-measure.\nThe weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, the traditional F-measure or balanced F-score is:\nThis is also known as the formula_11 measure, because recall and precision are evenly weighted.\nThe general formula for non-negative real formula_12 is:\nTwo other commonly used F measures are the formula_14 measure, which weights recall twice as much as precision, and the formula_15 measure, which weights precision twice as much as recall.\nThe F-measure was derived by van Rijsbergen (1979) so that formula_16 \"measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches formula_12 times as much importance to recall as precision\". It is based on van Rijsbergen's effectiveness measure formula_18.

It is calculated as TP/(TP + FP); that is, it is the proportion of true positives out of all positive results.\nPerhaps the simplest statistic is accuracy or Fraction Correct (FC), which measures the fraction of all instances that are correctly categorized; it is the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the total number of correct or incorrect classifications: (TP + TN)/Total Population = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN)."], "wikipedia-26591446": ["In addition to the Swets definitions, four relevance metrics have also been defined: Precision refers to the fraction of relevant documents that are retrieved (a/(a+b)), and Recall refers to the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant (a/(a+c)).

Considering the parameter $\\beta$ and after some simplification, we can see the $F$ measure may be written in the form on the righthand side of the figure. Often, $\\beta$ set to one, which indicates an equal preference towards precision and recall. In the case where $\\beta=1$, we have a special case of the $F$ measure, often called $F_1$. This is a popular measure, that is often used as a combined precision and recall score. If $\\beta$ is not equal to one, it controls the emphasis between precision and recall. It's easy to see that if you have a large precision or large recall than the $F_1$ measure would be high. But what's interesting is how the tradeoff between precision and recall is captured in the $F_1$ score. In order to understand the formulation, we can first ask the natural question: \\emph{Why not combine them using a simple arithmetic mean?} That would be likely the most natural way of combining them. Why is this not as good as $F_1$, \\ie, what's the problem with an arithmetic mean? The arithmetic mean's denominator tends to be dominated by large values. That means if you have a very high $P$ or a very high $R$, then you really don't care about whether the other value is low since the whole sum would be high. This is not the desirable effect because one can easily have a perfect recall by returning all the documents! Then we have a perfect recall and a low precision. This will still give a relatively high average. Such search results are clearly not very useful for users even though the average using this formula would be relatively high. In contrast, the $F_1$ score will reward a case where precision and recall are roughly similar. So, it would penalize a case with an extremely high result for only one of them. This means $F_1$ encodes a different tradeoff between them than a simple arithmetic mean. This example shows a very important methodology: when we try to solve a problem, you might naturally think of one solution. (\\eg, the arithmetic mean), but it's important not to settle on this solution; rather, think whether there are other ways to approach it. Once you have multiple ideas, it's important to analyze their differences and then think about which one makes more sense in a real scenario. To summarize, we talked about precision, which addresses the question: are the retrieval results all relevant? We also talked about recall, which addresses the question: have all the relevant documents been retrieved? These two are the two basic measures in information retrieval evaluation.

This shows that system A is better according to precision.\nBut we also mentioned that system B might be preferred by some other users who wish to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible. So, in that case we have to compare the number of total relevant documents to the number that is actually retrieved. This is captured in another measure called \textbf{recall}, which measures the completeness of coverage of relevant documents in your retrieval result. We assume that there are ten relevant documents in the collection. Here we've got two of them from system A, so the recall is $\frac{2}{10}=0.20$. System B has $\frac{3}{10}=0.30$. Therefore, system B is better according to recall.\nWe can have $a$ represent the number of documents that are retrieved and relevant, $b$ for documents that are not retrieved but relevant, $c$ for documents that are retrieved but not relevant, and $d$ for documents that are both not retrieved and not relevant. With this table, we have defined precision as the ratio of the relevant retrieved documents $a$ to the total number of retrieved documents $a$ and $c$: $\frac{a}{a+c}$. In this case, the denominator is all the retrieved documents. Recall is defined by dividing $a$ by the sum of $a$ and $b$, where $a+b$ is the total number of relevant documents. Precision and recall are focused on looking at $a$, the number of retrieved relevant documents. The two measures differ based on the denominator of the formula.\nSo what would be an ideal result? If precision and recall are both 1.0, that means all the results that we returned are relevant, and we didn't miss any relevant documents; there's no single non-relevant document returned.

The F score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall, where an F score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0."], "wikipedia-14343887": ["In pattern recognition, information retrieval and binary classification, precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, while recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances. Both precision and recall are therefore based on an understanding and measure of relevance.\nSuppose a computer program for recognizing dogs in photographs identifies 8 dogs in a picture containing 12 dogs and some cats. Of the 8 identified as dogs, 5 actually are dogs (true positives), while the rest are cats (false positives). The program's precision is 5/8 while its recall is 5/12. When a search engine returns 30 pages only 20 of which were relevant while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages, its precision is 20/30 = 2/3 while its recall is 20/60 = 1/3. So, in this case, precision is \"how useful the search results are\", and recall is \"how complete the results are\".\nIn simple terms, high precision means that an algorithm returned substantially more relevant results than irrelevant ones, while high recall means that an algorithm returned most of the relevant results.\nIn a classification task, the precision for a class is the \"number of true positives\" (i.e. the number of items correctly labeled as belonging to the positive class) \"divided by the total number of elements labeled as belonging to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false positives, which are items incorrectly labeled as belonging to the class). Recall in this context is defined as the \"number of true positives divided by the total number of elements that actually belong to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false negatives, which are items which were not labeled as belonging to the positive class but should have been).\nIn information retrieval, a perfect precision score of 1.0 means that every result retrieved by a search was relevant (but says nothing about whether all relevant documents were retrieved) whereas a perfect recall score of 1.0 means that all relevant documents were retrieved by the search (but says nothing about how many irrelevant documents were also retrieved).\nIn a classification task, a precision score of 1.0 for a class C means that every item labeled as belonging to class C does indeed belong to class C (but says nothing about the number of items from class C that were not labeled correctly) whereas a recall of 1.0 means that every item from class C was labeled as belonging to class C (but says nothing about how many other items were incorrectly also labeled as belonging to class C).\nOften, there is an inverse relationship between precision and recall, where it is possible to increase one at the cost of reducing the other. Brain surgery provides an illustrative example of the tradeoff. Consider a brain surgeon tasked with removing a cancerous tumor from a patient\u2019s brain. The surgeon needs to remove all of the tumor cells since any remaining cancer cells will regenerate the tumor. Conversely, the surgeon must not remove healthy brain cells since that would leave the patient with impaired brain function. The surgeon may be more liberal in the area of the brain he removes to ensure he has extracted all the cancer cells. This decision increases recall but reduces precision. On the other hand, the surgeon may be more conservative in the brain he removes to ensure he extracts only cancer cells. This decision increases precision but reduces recall. That is to say, greater recall increases the chances of removing healthy cells (negative outcome) and increases the chances of removing all cancer cells (positive outcome). Greater precision decreases the chances of removing healthy cells (positive outcome) but also decreases the chances of removing all cancer cells (negative outcome).\nUsually, precision and recall scores are not discussed in isolation. Instead, either values for one measure are compared for a fixed level at the other measure (e.g. \"precision at a recall level of 0.75\") or both are combined into a single measure. Examples of measures that are a combination of precision and recall are the F-measure (the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall), or the Matthews correlation coefficient, which is a geometric mean of the chance-corrected variants: the regression coefficients Informedness (DeltaP') and Markedness (DeltaP). Accuracy is a weighted arithmetic mean of Precision and Inverse Precision (weighted by Bias) as well as a weighted arithmetic mean of Recall and Inverse Recall (weighted by Prevalence). Inverse Precision and Inverse Recall are simply the Precision and Recall of the inverse problem where positive and negative labels are exchanged (for both real classes and prediction labels). Recall and Inverse Recall, or equivalently true positive rate and false positive rate, are frequently plotted against each other as ROC curves and provide a principled mechanism to explore operating point tradeoffs."], "wikipedia-50716473": ["Section::::Offline metrics.:Precision.\nPrecision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are relevant to the user's information need.\nIn binary classification, precision is analogous to positive predictive value. Precision takes all retrieved documents into account. It can also be evaluated at a given cut-off rank, considering only the topmost results returned by the system. This measure is called \"precision at n\" or \"P@n\".\nNote that the meaning and usage of \"precision\" in the field of information retrieval differs from the definition of accuracy and precision within other branches of science and statistics.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Recall.\nRecall is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved.\nIn binary classification, recall is often called sensitivity.

It is based on van Rijsbergen's effectiveness measure formula_18. Their relationship is:\nF-measure can be a better single metric when compared to precision and recall; both precision and recall give different information that can complement each other when combined.

Thus we need to evaluate the quality of a ranked list as opposed to whether\na relevant document was returned anywhere in the results.\nHow can we use precision and recall to evaluate a ranked list? Naturally, we\nwill have to look at precision and recall at different cutoffs since a ranked\nlist of relevant documents is determined by where the user stops browsing. If we\nassume the user sequentially browses the list of results, the user would stop at\nsome point. That point would determine the size of the set. Therefore, that's\nthe most important cutoff that we have to consider when we compute the\nprecision-recall.\nWithout knowing where exactly the user would stop, we have to consider all the\npossible positions where they might stop. A \\textbf{precision-recall} curve does\nexactly this as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:prcurve}\nWhat if the user stops at the first document? What's the precision-recall at\nthis point? Since $D_1$ is relevant, the precision is one out of one since we\nhave one document and it is relevant. What about the recall? Note that we are\nassuming that there are ten relevant documents for this query in the collection\nso it's one out of ten.\nWhat if the user stops at the second position? The precision is the same since\nboth $D_1$ and $D_2$ are relevant: 100\\%, or two out of two. The recall is two\nout of ten, or 20\\%. If the user stops at the third position, we have an\ninteresting case because we don't have any additional relevant documents, so the\nrecall does not change. However, the precision is lower because we have two out\nof three relevant documents. The recall won't change until we see another\nrelevant document. In this case, that point is at $D_5$. There, the recall has\nincreased to three out of ten and the precision is three out of five. As you can\nsee, if we keep doing this, we can also get to $D_8$ and have a precision of\nfour out of eight, because there are eight documents and four of them are\nrelevant. There, the recall is four out of ten.\nWhen can we get a recall of five out of ten? In this list, we don't have it. For\nconvenience, we often assume that the precision is zero in a situation like\nthis. This is a pessimistic assumption since the actual position would be\nhigher, but we make this assumption in order to have an easy way to compute\nanother measure called \\emph{average precision}, that we will discuss soon.\nNote that we've made some assumptions that are clearly not accurate. But, this\nis okay for the relative comparison of two text retrieval methods. As long as\nthe deviation is not biased toward any particular retrieval method, the measure\nis acceptable since we can still accurately tell which method works better. This\nis the most important point to keep in mind: when you compare different\nalgorithms, the key is to avoid any bias toward a particular method. As long as\nyou can avoid that, it's perfectly fine to do a transformation of these measures\nthat preserves the order.\nSince we can get a lot of precision-recall numbers at different positions, we\ncan plot a curve; this is what's shown on the right side of\nFigure~\\ref{fig:prcurve}. On the $x$-axis are the recall values. On the $y$-axis\nare the precision values. We plot precision-recall numbers so that we display at\nwhat recall we can obtain a certain precision. Furthermore, we can link these\npoints to form a curve. As you see in the figure, we assumed all the precision\nvalues at the high-level recalls are zero.

Since the accuracy measure does not distinguish different types of categorization errors, it is not appropriate to use it on a data set that has skewed distributions of instances in different classes. For example, in a binary categorization problem, if one category is much more popular than the other, than a trivial baseline that simply puts all instances in the category would have a pretty high categorization accuracy. To more appropriately evaluate such a categorization task, we can examine the categorization performance for each category. For example, we may treat the categorization results for each category as ``retrieval'' results for a query corresponding to the category and apply typical measures used in retrieval such as precision, recall and F measure to quantify the performance in a per-category manner.

Now, let's define these two measures more precisely and how these measures are used to evaluate a set of retrieved documents. That means we are considering that approximation of a set of relevant documents. We can distinguish the results in four cases, depending on the situation of a document as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:basicmeasure}.\nA document is either retrieved or not retrieved since we're talking about the \\emph{set} of results. The document can be also relevant or not relevant, depending on whether the user thinks this is a useful document. We now have counts of documents in each of the four categories. We can have $a$ represent the number of documents that are retrieved and relevant, $b$ for documents that are not retrieved but relevant, $c$ for documents that are retrieved but not relevant, and $d$ for documents that are both not retrieved and not relevant.\nWith this table, we have defined precision as the ratio of the relevant retrieved documents $a$ to the total number of retrieved documents $a$ and $c$: $\\frac{a}{a+c}$.

The mean 5 is not less than the minimum 2 nor greater than the maximum 8. If we increase the number of terms in the list to 2, 8, and 11, the arithmetic mean is found by solving for the value of \"A\" in the equation 2 + 8 + 11 = \"A\" + \"A\" + \"A\".

For example, if the speed for going from point \"A\" to \"B\" was 60 km/h, and the speed for returning from \"B\" to \"A\" was 40 km/h, then the harmonic mean speed is given by\n\nSection::::Calculation.:Statistical location.\nThe mode, the median, and the mid-range are often used in addition to the mean as estimates of central tendency in descriptive statistics. These can all be seen as minimizing variation by some measure; see .\n\nSection::::Calculation.:Statistical location.:Mode.\nThe most frequently occurring number in a list is called the mode. For example, the mode of the list (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4) is 3. It may happen that there are two or more numbers which occur equally often and more often than any other number. In this case there is no agreed definition of mode. Some authors say they are all modes and some say there is no mode.\n\nSection::::Calculation.:Statistical location.:Median.\nThe median is the middle number of the group when they are ranked in order. (If there are an even number of numbers, the mean of the middle two is taken.)\nThus to find the median, order the list according to its elements' magnitude and then repeatedly remove the pair consisting of the highest and lowest values until either one or two values are left. If exactly one value is left, it is the median; if two values, the median is the arithmetic mean of these two. This method takes the list 1, 7, 3, 13 and orders it to read 1, 3, 7, 13. Then the 1 and 13 are removed to obtain the list 3, 7. Since there are two elements in this remaining list, the median is their arithmetic mean, (3 + 7)/2 = 5.\n\nSection::::Calculation.:Statistical location.:Mid-range.\nThe mid-range is the arithmetic mean of the highest and lowest values of a set.\n\nSection::::Summary of types.\nThe table of mathematical symbols explains the symbols used below.\n\nSection::::Miscellaneous types.\nOther more sophisticated averages are: trimean, trimedian, and normalized mean, with their generalizations.\nOne can create one's own average metric using the generalized \"f\"-mean:\nwhere \"f\" is any invertible function. The harmonic mean is an example of this using \"f\"(\"x\") = 1/\"x\", and the geometric mean is another, using \"f\"(\"x\") = log \"x\".\nHowever, this method for generating means is not general enough to capture all averages. A more general method for defining an average takes any function \"g\"(\"x\", \"x\", ..., \"x\") of a list of arguments that is continuous, strictly increasing in each argument, and symmetric (invariant under permutation of the arguments). The average \"y\" is then the value that, when replacing each member of the list, results in the same function value: . This most general definition still captures the important property of all averages that the average of a list of identical elements is that element itself. The function provides the arithmetic mean. The function (where the list elements are positive numbers) provides the geometric mean.

Finally, linking email correspondence together (from sender to receivers) is a structured complement to the unstructured text content of the email itself. Perhaps of more interest to those reading this book is the ability to summarize research from a given field. Given proceedings from a conference, could we have a summarizer explain the main trends and common approaches? What was most novel compared to previous conferences?

Most techniques we discuss can be implemented without any human effort or only requiring minimal human effort; this is in contrast to some more detailed analysis of text data, particularly using natural language processing techniques. Such ``deep analysis'' techniques are obviously very important and are indeed necessary for some applications where we would like to go in-depth to understand text in detail. However, at this point, these techniques are often not scalable and they tend to require a large amount of human effort. In practice, it would be beneficial to combine both kinds of techniques. We envision three main (and potentially overlapping) categories of readers. \textbf{Students}. This book is specifically designed to give you hands-on experience in working with real text mining tools and applications. If used individually, we suggest first reading through chapters~\\ref{chap:intro} to~\\ref{chap:meta} in order to get a good understanding of the prerequisite knowledge in this book. Chapters~\\ref{chap:intro},~\\ref{chap:background}, and~\\ref{chap:nlp} will familiarize you with the concepts and vocabulary necessary to understand the future chapters. Chapter~\\ref{chap:meta} introduces you to the companion toolkit \\meta, which is used in exercises in each chapter. We hope the exercises and chapter descriptions can give you inspiration to work on your own text mining project. The provided code in \\meta~should give you a large head start and allow you to focus more on your contribution. If used in your class, there are several logical flows that your instructor may choose to take. As prerequisite knowledge, we assume you have some basic knowledge in probability and statistics as well as programming in a language such as C++ or Java. \\meta~is written in modern C++, though some exercises may be accomplished only by modifying config files. \textbf{Instructors}. We have gathered a logical and cohesive collection of topics that may be combined together for various course curricula. For example, part 1 and part 2 of the book may be used as an undergraduate introduction to \\emph{Information Retrieval} with a focus on how search engines work. Exercises assume basic programming experience and a little mathematical background in probability and statistics. A different undergraduate course may choose to survey the entire book as an \\emph{Introduction to Text Data Mining}, while skipping some chapters in part 2 that are more specific to search engine implementation and applications specific to the Web. Another choice would be using all parts as a supplemental graduate textbook, where there is still some emphasis on practical programming knowledge that can be combined with reading referenced papers in each chapter. Exercises for graduate students could be implementing some methods they read in the references into \\meta. The exercises at the end of each chapter give students experience working with a powerful---yet easily understandable---text retrieval and mining toolkit in addition to written questions. In a programming-focused class, using the \\meta~exercises is strongly encouraged. Programming assignments can be created from selecting a subset of exercises in each chapter. Due to the modular nature of the toolkit, additional programming experiments may be created by extending the existing system or implementing other well-known algorithms that do not come with \\meta~by default. Finally, students may use components of \\meta~they learned through the exercises to complete a larger final programming project. Using different corpora with the toolkit can yield different project challenges, \\eg~review summary \\vs~sentiment analysis. \textbf{Practitioners}. Most readers in industry would most likely use this book as a reference, although we also hope that it may serve as some inspiration in your own work.

One metric that is often used is called the $F_{\beta}$ measure, displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:f-measure}. In the case where $\\beta=1$, it's a harmonic mean of precision and recall. Considering the parameter $\\beta$ and after some simplification, we can see the $F$ measure may be written in the form on the righthand side of the figure. Often, $\\beta$ set to one, which indicates an equal preference towards precision and recall. In the case where $\\beta=1$, we have a special case of the $F$ measure, often called $F_1$. This is a popular measure, that is often used as a combined precision and recall score. If $\\beta$ is not equal to one, it controls the emphasis between precision and recall. It's easy to see that if you have a large precision or large recall than the $F_1$ measure would be high. But what's interesting is how the tradeoff between precision and recall is captured in the $F_1$ score. In order to understand the formulation, we can first ask the natural question: \\emph{Why not combine them using a simple arithmetic mean?} That would be likely the most natural way of combining them. Why is this not as good as $F_1$, \\ie, what's the problem with an arithmetic mean? The arithmetic mean's denominator tends to be dominated by large values. That means if you have a very high $P$ or a very high $R$, then you really don't care about whether the other value is low since the whole sum would be high. This is not the desirable effect because one can easily have a perfect recall by returning all the documents! Then we have a perfect recall and a low precision. This will still give a relatively high average. Such search results are clearly not very useful for users even though the average using this formula would be relatively high. In contrast, the $F_1$ score will reward a case where precision and recall are roughly similar. So, it would penalize a case with an extremely high result for only one of them. This means $F_1$ encodes a different tradeoff between them than a simple arithmetic mean. This example shows a very important methodology: when we try to solve a problem, you might naturally think of one solution. (\\eg, the arithmetic mean), but it's important not to settle on this solution; rather, think whether there are other ways to approach it. Once you have multiple ideas, it's important to analyze their differences and then think about which one makes more sense in a real scenario. To summarize, we talked about precision, which addresses the question: are the retrieval results all relevant? We also talked about recall, which addresses the question: have all the relevant documents been retrieved? These two are the two basic measures in information retrieval evaluation.

Both precision and recall are therefore based on an understanding and measure of relevance.\nSuppose a computer program for recognizing dogs in photographs identifies 8 dogs in a picture containing 12 dogs and some cats. Of the 8 identified as dogs, 5 actually are dogs (true positives), while the rest are cats (false positives). The program's precision is 5/8 while its recall is 5/12. When a search engine returns 30 pages only 20 of which were relevant while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages, its precision is 20/30 = 2/3 while its recall is 20/60 = 1/3. So, in this case, precision is \"how useful the search results are\", and recall is \"how complete the results are\".\nIn statistics, if the null hypothesis is that all items are \"irrelevant\" (where the hypothesis is accepted or rejected based on the number selected compared with the sample size), absence of type I and type II errors (i.e.: perfect sensitivity and specificity of 100% each) corresponds respectively to perfect precision (no false positive) and perfect recall (no false negative). The above pattern recognition example contained 8 \u2212 5 = 3 type I errors and 12 \u2212 5 = 7 type II errors. Precision can be seen as a measure of exactness or \"quality\", whereas recall is a measure of completeness or \"quantity\". The exact relationship between sensitivity and specificity to precision depends on the percent of positive cases in the population.\nIn simple terms, high precision means that an algorithm returned substantially more relevant results than irrelevant ones, while high recall means that an algorithm returned most of the relevant results.\nIn a classification task, the precision for a class is the \"number of true positives\" (i.e. the number of items correctly labeled as belonging to the positive class) \"divided by the total number of elements labeled as belonging to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false positives, which are items incorrectly labeled as belonging to the class). Recall in this context is defined as the \"number of true positives divided by the total number of elements that actually belong to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false negatives, which are items which were not labeled as belonging to the positive class but should have been).\nIn a classification task, a precision score of 1.0 for a class C means that every item labeled as belonging to class C does indeed belong to class C (but says nothing about the number of items from class C that were not labeled correctly) whereas a recall of 1.0 means that every item from class C was labeled as belonging to class C (but says nothing about how many other items were incorrectly also labeled as belonging to class C).\nOften, there is an inverse relationship between precision and recall, where it is possible to increase one at the cost of reducing the other. Brain surgery provides an illustrative example of the tradeoff. Consider a brain surgeon tasked with removing a cancerous tumor from a patient\u2019s brain. The surgeon needs to remove all of the tumor cells since any remaining cancer cells will regenerate the tumor. Conversely, the surgeon must not remove healthy brain cells since that would leave the patient with impaired brain function. The surgeon may be more liberal in the area of the brain he removes to ensure he has extracted all the cancer cells. This decision increases recall but reduces precision. On the other hand, the surgeon may be more conservative in the brain he removes to ensure he extracts only cancer cells. This decision increases precision but reduces recall. That is to say, greater recall increases the chances of removing healthy cells (negative outcome) and increases the chances of removing all cancer cells (positive outcome). Greater precision decreases the chances of removing healthy cells (positive outcome) but also decreases the chances of removing all cancer cells (negative outcome).\nUsually, precision and recall scores are not discussed in isolation. Instead, either values for one measure are compared for a fixed level at the other measure (e.g. \"precision at a recall level of 0.75\") or both are combined into a single measure. Examples of measures that are a combination of precision and recall are the F-measure (the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall), or the Matthews correlation coefficient, which is a geometric mean of the chance-corrected variants: the regression coefficients Informedness (DeltaP') and Markedness (DeltaP). Accuracy is a weighted arithmetic mean of Precision and Inverse Precision (weighted by Bias) as well as a weighted arithmetic mean of Recall and Inverse Recall (weighted by Prevalence). Inverse Precision and Inverse Recall are simply the Precision and Recall of the inverse problem where positive and negative labels are exchanged (for both real classes and prediction labels). Recall and Inverse Recall, or equivalently true positive rate and false positive rate, are frequently plotted against each other as ROC curves and provide a principled mechanism to explore operating point tradeoffs. Outside of Information Retrieval, the application of Recall, Precision and F-measure are argued to be flawed as they ignore the true negative cell of the contingency table, and they are easily manipulated by biasing the predictions. The first problem is 'solved' by using Accuracy and the second problem is 'solved' by discounting the chance component and renormalizing to Cohen's kappa, but this no longer affords the opportunity to explore tradeoffs graphically. However, Informedness and Markedness are Kappa-like renormalizations of Recall and Precision, and their geometric mean Matthews correlation coefficient thus acts like a debiased F-measure."], "wikipedia-26591446": ["In addition to the Swets definitions, four relevance metrics have also been defined: Precision refers to the fraction of relevant documents that are retrieved (a/(a+b)), and Recall refers to the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant (a/(a+c)).

Simply, if we look at all the entries where we see a particular $d$ and a particular $q$, we can calculate how likely we will see a one in the third column. We can first count how many times we see $q$ and $d$ as a pair in this table and then count how many times we actually have also seen a one in the third column and compute the ratio: Clearly, $p(R=1|d,q)+p(R=0|d,q)=1."], "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/vs-models.jsonl/28": ["The query has four words, so its vector representation would have a one for each of these four words, and zero for all the other words. Document $d_1$ has two ones, \\emph{news} and \\emph{about}, while the rest of the dimensions are zeros. Now that we have the two vectors, we can compute the similarity with the dot product by multiplying the corresponding elements in each vector. Each pair of vectors forms a product, which represents the similarity between the two vectors. We actually don't have to care about the zeroes in each vector since any product involving them would be zero. So, when we take a sum over all these pairs, we're just counting how many pairs of ones there are. In this case, there are two, so the result will be two. That means this number is the value of this scoring function; it's simply the count of how many unique query terms are matched in the document. This is how we interpret the score. Now we can also take a look at $d_3$. In this case, you can see the result is three because $d_3$ matched the three distinct query words \\emph{news}, \\emph{presidential}, and \\emph{campaign}, whereas $d_1$ only matched two. Based on this, $d_3$ is ranked above $d_1. That looks pretty good. However, if we examine this model in detail, we will find some problems. In Figure~\\ref{fig:bitvectorrank}, we show all the scores for these five documents. The bit vector scoring function counts the number of unique query terms matched in each document.

Thus, $M_{ij}$ is the probability of going from $d_i$ to $d_j$. Each row's values should sum to one, because the surfer will have to go to precisely one of these pages. Now, how can we compute the probability of a surfer visiting a particular page? We can compute the probability of reaching a page as follows: On the left-hand side is the probability of visiting page $d_j$ at time $t+1$, the next time count. On the right side, we can see the equation involves the probability at page $d_i$ at time $t$, the current time step. The equation captures the two possibilities of reaching a page $d_j$ at time $t+1$: through random surfing or following a link. The first part of the equation captures the probability that the random server would reach this page by following a link. The random surfer chooses this strategy with probability $1-\\alpha$; thus, there is a factor of $1-\\alpha$ before this term. This term sums over all the possible $N$ pages that the surfer could have been at time $t$. Inside the sum is the product of two probabilities. One is the probability that the surfer was at $d_i$ at time $t$. That's $p_t(d_i)$. The other is the transition probability from $d_i$ to $d_j$, which we know is represented as $M_{ij}$. So, in order to reach this $d_j$ page, the surfer must first be at $d_i$ at time $t$ and would have to follow the link to go from $d_i$ to $d_j$. The second part is a similar sum. The only difference is that now the transition probability is uniform: $\\frac{1}{N}$. This part captures the probability of reaching this page through random jumping, where $\\alpha$ is the probability of random jumping. This also allows us to see why PageRank captures a smoothing of the transition matrix. You can think this $\\frac{1}{N}$ comes from another transition matrix that has all the elements as $\\frac{1}{N}$. It is then clear that we can merge the two parts. Because they are of the same form, we can imagine there's a different matrix that's a combination of this $M$ and the uniform matrix $I$. In this sense, PageRank uses this idea of smoothing to ensure that there's no $0$ entry in the transition matrix. Now, we can imagine if we want to compute average probabilities, those would satisfy this equation without considering the time index. So let's drop the time index and assume that they would be equal; this would give us $N$ equations, since each page has its own equation. Similarly, there are also precisely $N$ variables.

It is commonly referred to as the first pass yield (FPY).\nTo calculate the TEEP, the OEE is multiplied by a fourth component:\nBULLET::::- Loading: percentage of total calendar time that is actually scheduled for operation.\nThe calculations of OEE are not particularly complicated, but care must be taken as to standards that are used as the basis. Additionally, these calculations are valid at the work center or part number level but become more complicated if rolling down to aggregate levels.\nSection::::Calculations for OEE and TEEP.:Overall equipment effectiveness.\nEach of the three components of the OEE points to an aspect of the process that can be targeted for improvement. OEE may be applied to any individual Work Center, or rolled up to Department or Plant levels. This tool also allows for drilling down for very specific analysis, such as a particular Part Number, Shift, or any of several other parameters.\nIt is unlikely that any manufacturing process can run at 100% OEE. Many manufacturers benchmark their industry to set a challenging target; 85% is not uncommon.\nBULLET::::- OEE is calculated with the formula (Availability)*(Performance)*(Quality)\nBULLET::::- Using the examples given below:\nBULLET::::- (Availability= 86.6%)*(Performance=93%)*(Quality=91.3%)= (OEE=73.6%)\nAlternatively, and often easier, OEE is calculated by dividing the minimum time needed to produce the parts under optimal conditions by the actual time needed to produce the parts.

The remaining 7,200 seconds or 2 hours were lost.\nBULLET::::- The OEE is now the 21,600 seconds divided by 28,800 seconds (same as minimal 1.5 seconds per part divided by 2 actual seconds per part), or 75%."], "wikipedia-32825366": ["There are six steps to building QBR:\nBULLET::::- Each QB \"action play\" (passes, rushes, sacks, scrambles, or penalties attributable to the QB) is measured in terms of the expected points added (EPA)\nBULLET::::- Adjust for the difficulty of each play.

One metric that is often used is called the $F_{\\beta}$ measure, displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:f-measure}. In the case where $\\beta=1$, it's a harmonic mean of precision and recall. Considering the parameter $\\beta$ and after some simplification, we can see the $F$ measure may be written in the form on the righthand side of the figure. Often, $\\beta$ set to one, which indicates an equal preference towards precision and recall. In the case where $\\beta=1$, we have a special case of the $F$ measure, often called $F_1$. This is a popular measure, that is often used as a combined precision and recall score. If $\\beta$ is not equal to one, it controls the emphasis between precision and recall. It's easy to see that if you have a large precision or large recall than the $F_1$ measure would be high. But what's interesting is how the tradeoff between precision and recall is captured in the $F_1$ score. In order to understand the formulation, we can first ask the natural question: \\emph{Why not combine them using a simple arithmetic mean?} That would be likely the most natural way of combining them. Why is this not as good as $F_1$, \\ie, what's the problem with an arithmetic mean? The arithmetic mean's denominator tends to be dominated by large values. That means if you have a very high $P$ or a very high $R$, then you really don't care about whether the other value is low since the whole sum would be high. This is not the desirable effect because one can easily have a perfect recall by returning all the documents! Then we have a perfect recall and a low precision. This will still give a relatively high average. Such search results are clearly not very useful for users even though the average using this formula would be relatively high. In contrast, the $F_1$ score will reward a case where precision and recall are roughly similar. So, it would penalize a case with an extremely high result for only one of them. This means $F_1$ encodes a different tradeoff between them than a simple arithmetic mean. This example shows a very important methodology: when we try to solve a problem, you might naturally think of one solution. (\\eg, the arithmetic mean), but it's important not to settle on this solution; rather, think whether there are other ways to approach it. Once you have multiple ideas, it's important to analyze their differences and then think about which one makes more sense in a real scenario. To summarize, we talked about precision, which addresses the question: are the retrieval results all relevant? We also talked about recall, which addresses the question: have all the relevant documents been retrieved? These two are the two basic measures in information retrieval evaluation. They are used for many other tasks as well. We talked about $F$ measure as a way to combine precision and recall. We also talked about the tradeoff between precision and recall, and it turns out to depend on the users' search tasks and preferences."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/3": ["This can be captured by the measure of \textbf{precision}, where we simply compute to what extent all the retrieval results are relevant. One hundred percent precision that would mean all the retrieved documents are relevant. Thus in this case, system A has a precision of $\frac{2}{3}=0.6\\overline{6}$. System B has $\frac{3}{5}=0.60$. This shows that system A is better according to precision.\nBut we also mentioned that system B might be preferred by some other users who wish to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible. So, in that case we have to compare the number of total relevant documents to the number that is actually retrieved. This is captured in another measure called \textbf{recall}, which measures the completeness of coverage of relevant documents in your retrieval result. We assume that there are ten relevant documents in the collection. Here we've got two of them from system A, so the recall is $\frac{2}{10}=0.20$. System B has $\frac{3}{10}=0.30$. Therefore, system B is better according to recall.\nNow, let's define these two measures more precisely and how these measures are used to evaluate a set of retrieved documents. That means we are considering that approximation of a set of relevant documents. We can distinguish the results in four cases, depending on the situation of a document as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:basicmeasure}.\nA document is either retrieved or not retrieved since we're talking about the \\emph{set} of results. The document can be also relevant or not relevant, depending on whether the user thinks this is a useful document. We now have counts of documents in each of the four categories. We can have $a$ represent the number of documents that are retrieved and relevant, $b$ for documents that are not retrieved but relevant, $c$ for documents that are retrieved but not relevant, and $d$ for documents that are both not retrieved and not relevant. With this table, we have defined precision as the ratio of the relevant retrieved documents $a$ to the total number of retrieved documents $a$ and $c$: $\frac{a}{a+c}$. In this case, the denominator is all the retrieved documents. Recall is defined by dividing $a$ by the sum of $a$ and $b$, where $a+b$ is the total number of relevant documents. Precision and recall are focused on looking at $a$, the number of retrieved relevant documents. The two measures differ based on the denominator of the formula."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2. The terms 'precision,' 'recall,' 'F-measure,' and 'macro averaging' are well-documented in Wikipedia, particularly in pages related to machine learning, information retrieval, and statistical classification. Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions, recall assesses the ability to find all relevant instances, and the F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Macro averaging computes these metrics independently for each class and then takes the average, ensuring equal weight for all classes. Wikipedia provides detailed definitions, formulas, and contextual applications for these terms.", "wikipedia-14343887": ["In pattern recognition, information retrieval and binary classification, precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, while recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances. Both precision and recall are therefore based on an understanding and measure of relevance.\n\nSuppose a computer program for recognizing dogs in photographs identifies 8 dogs in a picture containing 12 dogs and some cats. Of the 8 identified as dogs, 5 actually are dogs (true positives), while the rest are cats (false positives). The program's precision is 5/8 while its recall is 5/12. When a search engine returns 30 pages only 20 of which were relevant while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages, its precision is 20/30 = 2/3 while its recall is 20/60 = 1/3. So, in this case, precision is \"how useful the search results are\", and recall is \"how complete the results are\".\n\nIn simple terms, high precision means that an algorithm returned substantially more relevant results than irrelevant ones, while high recall means that an algorithm returned most of the relevant results.\n\nIn a classification task, the precision for a class is the \"number of true positives\" (i.e. the number of items correctly labeled as belonging to the positive class) \"divided by the total number of elements labeled as belonging to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false positives, which are items incorrectly labeled as belonging to the class). Recall in this context is defined as the \"number of true positives divided by the total number of elements that actually belong to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false negatives, which are items which were not labeled as belonging to the positive class but should have been).\n\nOften, there is an inverse relationship between precision and recall, where it is possible to increase one at the cost of reducing the other. Brain surgery provides an illustrative example of the tradeoff. Consider a brain surgeon tasked with removing a cancerous tumor from a patient\u2019s brain. The surgeon needs to remove all of the tumor cells since any remaining cancer cells will regenerate the tumor. Conversely, the surgeon must not remove healthy brain cells since that would leave the patient with impaired brain function. The surgeon may be more liberal in the area of the brain he removes to ensure he has extracted all the cancer cells. This decision increases recall but reduces precision. On the other hand, the surgeon may be more conservative in the brain he removes to ensure he extracts only cancer cells. This decision increases precision but reduces recall. That is to say, greater recall increases the chances of removing healthy cells (negative outcome) and increases the chances of removing all cancer cells (positive outcome). Greater precision decreases the chances of removing healthy cells (positive outcome) but also decreases the chances of removing all cancer cells (negative outcome).\n\nUsually, precision and recall scores are not discussed in isolation. Instead, either values for one measure are compared for a fixed level at the other measure (e.g. \"precision at a recall level of 0.75\") or both are combined into a single measure. Examples of measures that are a combination of precision and recall are the F-measure (the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall), or the Matthews correlation coefficient, which is a geometric mean of the chance-corrected variants: the regression coefficients Informedness (DeltaP') and Markedness (DeltaP)."], "wikipedia-4011785": ["In statistical analysis of binary classification, the F score (also F-score or F-measure) is a measure of a test's accuracy.

This measure is called \"precision at n\" or \"P@n\".\nNote that the meaning and usage of \"precision\" in the field of information retrieval differs from the definition of accuracy and precision within other branches of science and statistics.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Recall.\nRecall is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved.\nIn binary classification, recall is often called sensitivity. So it can be looked at as \"the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query\".\nIt is trivial to achieve recall of 100% by returning all documents in response to any query. Therefore, recall alone is not enough but one needs to measure the number of non-relevant documents also, for example by computing the precision.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:F-score / F-measure.\nThe weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, the traditional F-measure or balanced F-score is:\nThis is also known as the formula_11 measure, because recall and precision are evenly weighted.\nThe general formula for non-negative real formula_12 is:\nTwo other commonly used F measures are the formula_14 measure, which weights recall twice as much as precision, and the formula_15 measure, which weights precision twice as much as recall.\nThe F-measure was derived by van Rijsbergen (1979) so that formula_16 \"measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches formula_12 times as much importance to recall as precision\". It is based on van Rijsbergen's effectiveness measure formula_18. Their relationship is:\nF-measure can be a better single metric when compared to precision and recall; both precision and recall give different information that can complement each other when combined.

We also talked about recall, which addresses the question: have all the relevant documents been retrieved? These two are the two basic measures in information retrieval evaluation. They are used for many other tasks as well. We talked about $F$ measure as a way to combine precision and recall. We also talked about the tradeoff between precision and recall, and it turns out to depend on the users' search tasks and preferences.\n\nThere tends to be a tradeoff between precision and recall, so it is natural to combine them. One metric that is often used is called the $F_{\\beta}$ measure, displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:f-measure}. In the case where $\\beta=1$, it's a harmonic mean of precision and recall.\nConsidering the parameter $\\beta$ and after some simplification, we can see the $F$ measure may be written in the form on the righthand side of the figure.\nOften, $\\beta$ set to one, which indicates an equal preference towards precision and recall.  In the case where $\\beta=1$, we have a special case of the $F$ measure, often called $F_1$. This is a popular measure, that is often used as a combined precision and recall score. If $\\beta$ is not equal to one, it controls the emphasis between precision and recall. It's easy to see that if you have a large precision or large recall than the $F_1$ measure would be high. But what's interesting is how the tradeoff between precision and recall is captured in the $F_1$ score."], "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/evaluation.jsonl/2": ["As with information retrieval evaluation, we can use precision, recall, and $F_1$ score by considering true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. We are also usually concerned about accuracy, which is defined as the number of correct categorization decisions made by the system divided by the total number of categorization decisions made by the system.  Since the accuracy measure does not distinguish different types of categorization errors, it is not appropriate to use it on a data set that has skewed distributions of instances in different classes. For example, in a binary categorization problem, if one category is much more popular than the other, than a trivial baseline that simply puts all instances in the category would have a pretty high categorization accuracy. To more appropriately evaluate such a categorization task, we can examine the categorization performance for each category. For example, we may treat the categorization results for each category as ``retrieval'' results for a query corresponding to the category and apply typical measures used in retrieval such as precision, recall and F measure to quantify the performance in a per-category manner. Readers can find more discussion about this in the reference \\cite{Yang:99}."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/3": ["This can be captured by the measure of \textbf{precision}, where we simply compute to what extent all the retrieval results are relevant. One hundred percent precision that would mean all the retrieved documents are relevant. Thus in this case, system A has a precision of $\\frac{2}{3}=0.6\\overline{6}$. System B has $\\frac{3}{5}=0.60$. This shows that system A is better according to precision.\nBut we also mentioned that system B might be preferred by some other users who wish to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible. So, in that case we have to compare the number of total relevant documents to the number that is actually retrieved. This is captured in another measure called \textbf{recall}, which measures the completeness of coverage of relevant documents in your retrieval result. We assume that there are ten relevant documents in the collection. Here we've got two of them from system A, so the recall is $\\frac{2}{10}=0.20$. System B has $\\frac{3}{10}=0.30$. Therefore, system B is better according to recall.\nThese two measures are the very basic foundation for evaluating search engines. They are very important because they are also widely used in many other evaluation problems. For example, if you look at the applications of machine learning you tend to see precision and recall numbers being reported for all kinds of tasks. Now, let's define these two measures more precisely and how these measures are used to evaluate a set of retrieved documents. That means we are considering that approximation of a set of relevant documents. We can distinguish the results in four cases, depending on the situation of a document as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:basicmeasure}.\nA document is either retrieved or not retrieved since we're talking about the \\emph{set} of results. The document can be also relevant or not relevant, depending on whether the user thinks this is a useful document. We now have counts of documents in each of the four categories. We can have $a$ represent the number of documents that are retrieved and relevant, $b$ for documents that are not retrieved but relevant, $c$ for documents that are retrieved but not relevant, and $d$ for documents that are both not retrieved and not relevant.\nWith this table, we have defined precision as the ratio of the relevant retrieved documents $a$ to the total number of retrieved documents $a$ and $c$: $\\frac{a}{a+c}$. In this case, the denominator is all the retrieved documents.\nRecall is defined by dividing $a$ by the sum of $a$ and $b$, where $a+b$ is the total number of relevant documents. Precision and recall are focused on looking at $a$, the number of retrieved relevant documents. The two measures differ based on the denominator of the formula."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-14343887": 2, "wikipedia-41932": 1, "wikipedia-4011785": 1, "wikipedia-50716473": 2, "wikipedia-24009146": 1, "wikipedia-2636604": 1, "wikipedia-19822072": 1, "wikipedia-24997830": 1, "wikipedia-18673553": 1, "wikipedia-24467258": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/4": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/8": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/exercises.jsonl/4": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/evaluation.jsonl/2": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/vs-models.jsonl/32": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/bayesian-stats.jsonl/22": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/exercises.jsonl/2": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/joint-analysis/time-series.jsonl/6": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/3": 2}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-14343887": 3, "wikipedia-41932": 1, "wikipedia-4011785": 2, "wikipedia-50716473": 3, "wikipedia-24009146": 1, "wikipedia-2636604": 1, "wikipedia-19822072": 1, "wikipedia-24997830": 1, "wikipedia-18673553": 1, "wikipedia-24467258": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/4": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/8": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/exercises.jsonl/4": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/evaluation.jsonl/2": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/vs-models.jsonl/32": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/bayesian-stats.jsonl/22": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/exercises.jsonl/2": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/joint-analysis/time-series.jsonl/6": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/3": 3}}}

Yes  \n2. Wikipedia contains introductory and foundational information on topics like classification systems (e.g., machine learning, categorization) and metrics such as precision and recall. These pages often provide basic definitions, examples, and context that would help explain the prior knowledge required to understand the discussion in the query.", "wikipedia-14343887": ["Precision and recall\nIn pattern recognition, information retrieval and binary classification, precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, while recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances. Both precision and recall are therefore based on an understanding and measure of relevance.\nSuppose a computer program for recognizing dogs in photographs identifies 8 dogs in a picture containing 12 dogs and some cats. Of the 8 identified as dogs, 5 actually are dogs (true positives), while the rest are cats (false positives). The program's precision is 5/8 while its recall is 5/12. When a search engine returns 30 pages only 20 of which were relevant while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages, its precision is 20/30 = 2/3 while its recall is 20/60 = 1/3. So, in this case, precision is \"how useful the search results are\", and recall is \"how complete the results are\".\nIn statistics, if the null hypothesis is that all items are \"irrelevant\" (where the hypothesis is accepted or rejected based on the number selected compared with the sample size), absence of type I and type II errors (i.e.: perfect sensitivity and specificity of 100% each) corresponds respectively to perfect precision (no false positive) and perfect recall (no false negative). The above pattern recognition example contained 8 \u2212 5 = 3 type I errors and 12 \u2212 5 = 7 type II errors. Precision can be seen as a measure of exactness or \"quality\", whereas recall is a measure of completeness or \"quantity\". The exact relationship between sensitivity and specificity to precision depends on the percent of positive cases in the population.\nIn simple terms, high precision means that an algorithm returned substantially more relevant results than irrelevant ones, while high recall means that an algorithm returned most of the relevant results.\nSection::::Introduction.\nIn an information retrieval (IR) scenario, the instances are documents and the task is to return a set of relevant documents given a search term; or equivalently, to assign each document to one of two categories, \"relevant\" and \"not relevant\". In this case, the \"relevant\" documents are simply those that belong to the \"relevant\" category. Recall is defined as the \"number of relevant documents\" retrieved by a search \"divided by the total number of existing relevant documents\", while precision is defined as the \"number of relevant documents\" retrieved by a search \"divided by the total number of documents retrieved\" by that search.\nIn a classification task, the precision for a class is the \"number of true positives\" (i.e. the number of items correctly labeled as belonging to the positive class) \"divided by the total number of elements labeled as belonging to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false positives, which are items incorrectly labeled as belonging to the class). Recall in this context is defined as the \"number of true positives divided by the total number of elements that actually belong to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false negatives, which are items which were not labeled as belonging to the positive class but should have been).\nIn information retrieval, a perfect precision score of 1.0 means that every result retrieved by a search was relevant (but says nothing about whether all relevant documents were retrieved) whereas a perfect recall score of 1.0 means that all relevant documents were retrieved by the search (but says nothing about how many irrelevant documents were also retrieved).\nIn a classification task, a precision score of 1.0 for a class C means that every item labeled as belonging to class C does indeed belong to class C (but says nothing about the number of items from class C that were not labeled correctly) whereas a recall of 1.0 means that every item from class C was labeled as belonging to class C (but says nothing about how many other items were incorrectly also labeled as belonging to class C).\nOften, there is an inverse relationship between precision and recall, where it is possible to increase one at the cost of reducing the other. Brain surgery provides an illustrative example of the tradeoff. Consider a brain surgeon tasked with removing a cancerous tumor from a patient\u2019s brain. The surgeon needs to remove all of the tumor cells since any remaining cancer cells will regenerate the tumor. Conversely, the surgeon must not remove healthy brain cells since that would leave the patient with impaired brain function. The surgeon may be more liberal in the area of the brain he removes to ensure he has extracted all the cancer cells. This decision increases recall but reduces precision. On the other hand, the surgeon may be more conservative in the brain he removes to ensure he extracts only cancer cells. This decision increases precision but reduces recall. That is to say, greater recall increases the chances of removing healthy cells (negative outcome) and increases the chances of removing all cancer cells (positive outcome). Greater precision decreases the chances of removing healthy cells (positive outcome) but also decreases the chances of removing all cancer cells (negative outcome).\nUsually, precision and recall scores are not discussed in isolation. Instead, either values for one measure are compared for a fixed level at the other measure (e.g. \"precision at a recall level of 0.75\") or both are combined into a single measure. Examples of measures that are a combination of precision and recall are the F-measure (the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall), or the Matthews correlation coefficient, which is a geometric mean of the chance-corrected variants: the regression coefficients Informedness (DeltaP') and Markedness (DeltaP). Accuracy is a weighted arithmetic mean of Precision and Inverse Precision (weighted by Bias) as well as a weighted arithmetic mean of Recall and Inverse Recall (weighted by Prevalence). Inverse Precision and Inverse Recall are simply the Precision and Recall of the inverse problem where positive and negative labels are exchanged (for both real classes and prediction labels). Recall and Inverse Recall, or equivalently true positive rate and false positive rate, are frequently plotted against each other as ROC curves and provide a principled mechanism to explore operating point tradeoffs. Outside of Information Retrieval, the application of Recall, Precision and F-measure are argued to be flawed as they ignore the true negative cell of the contingency table, and they are easily manipulated by biasing the predictions. The first problem is 'solved' by using Accuracy and the second problem is 'solved' by discounting the chance component and renormalizing to Cohen's kappa, but this no longer affords the opportunity to explore tradeoffs graphically. However, Informedness and Markedness are Kappa-like renormalizations of Recall and Precision, and their geometric mean Matthews correlation coefficient thus acts like a debiased F-measure."]}, "textbook/textdatabook": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

We also talked about recall, which addresses the question: have all the relevant documents been retrieved? These two are the two basic measures in information retrieval evaluation. They are used for many other tasks as well."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/3": ["We can now discuss how to actually quantify their performance. Suppose we have a total of ten relevant documents in the corpus for the current query, $Q_1$. Of course, the relevance judgements shown on the right did not include all the ten. We have only seen three relevant documents there, but we can imagine there are other documents judged for this query. Intuitively we thought that system A is better because it did not have much noise. In particular we have seen, out of three results, two are relevant. On the other hand, in System B we have five results and only three of them are relevant. Based on this, it looks like system A is more \\emph{accurate}. This can be captured by the measure of \\textbf{precision}, where we simply compute to what extent all the retrieval results are relevant. One hundred percent precision that would mean all the retrieved documents are relevant. Thus in this case, system A has a precision of \\frac{2}{3}=0.6\\overline{6}. System B has \\frac{3}{5}=0.60. This shows that system A is better according to precision. But we also mentioned that system B might be preferred by some other users who wish to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible. So, in that case we have to compare the number of total relevant documents to the number that is actually retrieved. This is captured in another measure called \\textbf{recall}, which measures the completeness of coverage of relevant documents in your retrieval result. We assume that there are ten relevant documents in the collection. Here we've got two of them from system A, so the recall is \\frac{2}{10}=0.20. System B has \\frac{3}{10}=0.30. Therefore, system B is better according to recall. These two measures are the very basic foundation for evaluating search engines. They are very important because they are also widely used in many other evaluation problems. For example, if you look at the applications of machine learning you tend to see precision and recall numbers being reported for all kinds of tasks. Now, let's define these two measures more precisely and how these measures are used to evaluate a set of retrieved documents. That means we are considering that approximation of a set of relevant documents. We can distinguish the results in four cases, depending on the situation of a document as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:basicmeasure}. A document is either retrieved or not retrieved since we're talking about the \\emph{set} of results. The document can be also relevant or not relevant, depending on whether the user thinks this is a useful document. We now have counts of documents in each of the four categories. We can have $a$ represent the number of documents that are retrieved and relevant, $b$ for documents that are not retrieved but relevant, $c$ for documents that are retrieved but not relevant, and $d$ for documents that are both not retrieved and not relevant. With this table, we have defined precision as the ratio of the relevant retrieved documents $a$ to the total number of retrieved documents $a$ and $c$: \\frac{a}{a+c}. In this case, the denominator is all the retrieved documents. Recall is defined by dividing $a$ by the sum of $a$ and $b$, where $a+b$ is the total number of relevant documents. Precision and recall are focused on looking at $a$, the number of retrieved relevant documents. The two measures differ based on the denominator of the formula. So what would be an ideal result? If precision and recall are both 1.0, that means all the results that we returned are relevant, and we didn't miss any relevant documents; there's no single non-relevant document returned. In reality however, high recall tends to be associated with low precision; as you go down the list to try to get as many relevant documents as possible, you tend to include many non-relevant documents, which decreases the precision. We often are interested in the precision up to ten documents for web search. This means we look at the top ten results and see how many documents among them are actually relevant. This is a very meaningful measure, because it tells us how many relevant documents a user can expect to see on the first page of search results (where there are typically ten results)."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Both precision and recall are therefore based on an understanding and measure of relevance.\n\nSuppose a computer program for recognizing dogs in photographs identifies 8 dogs in a picture containing 12 dogs and some cats. Of the 8 identified as dogs, 5 actually are dogs (true positives), while the rest are cats (false positives). The program's precision is 5/8 while its recall is 5/12. When a search engine returns 30 pages only 20 of which were relevant while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages, its precision is 20/30 = 2/3 while its recall is 20/60 = 1/3. So, in this case, precision is \"how useful the search results are\", and recall is \"how complete the results are\".\n\nIn simple terms, high precision means that an algorithm returned substantially more relevant results than irrelevant ones, while high recall means that an algorithm returned most of the relevant results."]}, "textbook/textdatabook": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Since the accuracy measure does not distinguish different types of categorization errors, it is not appropriate to use it on a data set that has skewed distributions of instances in different classes. For example, in a binary categorization problem, if one category is much more popular than the other, than a trivial baseline that simply puts all instances in the category would have a pretty high categorization accuracy. To more appropriately evaluate such a categorization task, we can examine the categorization performance for each category. For example, we may treat the categorization results for each category as ``retrieval'' results for a query corresponding to the category and apply typical measures used in retrieval such as precision, recall and F measure to quantify the performance in a per-category manner.

Of course, the relevance judgements shown on the right did not include all the ten. We have only seen three relevant documents there, but we can imagine there are other documents judged for this query. Intuitively we thought that system A is better because it did not have much noise. In particular we have seen, out of three results, two are relevant. On the other hand, in System B we have five results and only three of them are relevant. Based on this, it looks like system A is more \\emph{accurate}. This can be captured by the measure of \\textbf{precision}, where we simply compute to what extent all the retrieval results are relevant. One hundred percent precision that would mean all the retrieved documents are relevant. Thus in this case, system A has a precision of $\\frac{2}{3}=0.6\\overline{6}$. System B has $\\frac{3}{5}=0.60$. This shows that system A is better according to precision.\nBut we also mentioned that system B might be preferred by some other users who wish to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible. So, in that case we have to compare the number of total relevant documents to the number that is actually retrieved. This is captured in another measure called \\textbf{recall}, which measures the completeness of coverage of relevant documents in your retrieval result. We assume that there are ten relevant documents in the collection. Here we've got two of them from system A, so the recall is $\\frac{2}{10}=0.20$. System B has $\\frac{3}{10}=0.30$. Therefore, system B is better according to recall.\nThese two measures are the very basic foundation for evaluating search engines. They are very important because they are also widely used in many other evaluation problems. For example, if you look at the applications of machine learning you tend to see precision and recall numbers being reported for all kinds of tasks. Now, let's define these two measures more precisely and how these measures are used to evaluate a set of retrieved documents. That means we are considering that approximation of a set of relevant documents. We can distinguish the results in four cases, depending on the situation of a document as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:basicmeasure}.\nA document is either retrieved or not retrieved since we're talking about the \\emph{set} of results. The document can be also relevant or not relevant, depending on whether the user thinks this is a useful document. We now have counts of documents in each of the four categories. We can have $a$ represent the number of documents that are retrieved and relevant, $b$ for documents that are not retrieved but relevant, $c$ for documents that are retrieved but not relevant, and $d$ for documents that are both not retrieved and not relevant.\nWith this table, we have defined precision as the ratio of the relevant retrieved documents $a$ to the total number of retrieved documents $a$ and $c$: $\\frac{a}{a+c}$.

In reality however, high recall tends to be associated with low precision; as you go down the list to try to get as many relevant documents as possible, you tend to include many non-relevant documents, which decreases the precision. We often are interested in the precision up to ten documents for web search. This means we look at the top ten results and see how many documents among them are actually relevant. This is a very meaningful measure, because it tells us how many relevant documents a user can expect to see on the first page of search results (where there are typically ten results)."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-43218024": 1, "wikipedia-205393": 1, "wikipedia-41932": 1, "wikipedia-50123287": 1, "wikipedia-18826584": 1, "wikipedia-8909028": 1, "wikipedia-11376019": 1, "wikipedia-218445": 1, "wikipedia-9777020": 1, "wikipedia-4692838": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/prob-models.jsonl/29": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/vs-models.jsonl/9": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/vs-models.jsonl/32": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/prob-models.jsonl/27": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/prob-models.jsonl/28": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/11": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/background/mooc-nlp.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/3": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/joint-analysis/social-network.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/3": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-43218024": 1, "wikipedia-205393": 1, "wikipedia-41932": 1, "wikipedia-50123287": 1, "wikipedia-18826584": 1, "wikipedia-8909028": 1, "wikipedia-11376019": 1, "wikipedia-218445": 1, "wikipedia-9777020": 1, "wikipedia-4692838": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/prob-models.jsonl/29": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/vs-models.jsonl/9": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/vs-models.jsonl/32": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/prob-models.jsonl/27": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/prob-models.jsonl/28": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/11": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/background/mooc-nlp.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/3": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/joint-analysis/social-network.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/3": 1}}}

Both precision and recall are therefore based on an understanding and measure of relevance.\n\nSuppose a computer program for recognizing dogs in photographs identifies 8 dogs in a picture containing 12 dogs and some cats. Of the 8 identified as dogs, 5 actually are dogs (true positives), while the rest are cats (false positives). The program's precision is 5/8 while its recall is 5/12. When a search engine returns 30 pages only 20 of which were relevant while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages, its precision is 20/30 = 2/3 while its recall is 20/60 = 1/3. So, in this case, precision is \"how useful the search results are\", and recall is \"how complete the results are\".\n\nIn simple terms, high precision means that an algorithm returned substantially more relevant results than irrelevant ones, while high recall means that an algorithm returned most of the relevant results.\n\nIn a classification task, the precision for a class is the \"number of true positives\" (i.e. the number of items correctly labeled as belonging to the positive class) \"divided by the total number of elements labeled as belonging to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false positives, which are items incorrectly labeled as belonging to the class). Recall in this context is defined as the \"number of true positives divided by the total number of elements that actually belong to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false negatives, which are items which were not labeled as belonging to the positive class but should have been).\n\nIn information retrieval, a perfect precision score of 1.0 means that every result retrieved by a search was relevant (but says nothing about whether all relevant documents were retrieved) whereas a perfect recall score of 1.0 means that all relevant documents were retrieved by the search (but says nothing about how many irrelevant documents were also retrieved).\n\nIn a classification task, a precision score of 1.0 for a class C means that every item labeled as belonging to class C does indeed belong to class C (but says nothing about the number of items from class C that were not labeled correctly) whereas a recall of 1.0 means that every item from class C was labeled as belonging to class C (but says nothing about how many other items were incorrectly also labeled as belonging to class C).\n\nOften, there is an inverse relationship between precision and recall, where it is possible to increase one at the cost of reducing the other. Brain surgery provides an illustrative example of the tradeoff. Consider a brain surgeon tasked with removing a cancerous tumor from a patient\u2019s brain. The surgeon needs to remove all of the tumor cells since any remaining cancer cells will regenerate the tumor. Conversely, the surgeon must not remove healthy brain cells since that would leave the patient with impaired brain function. The surgeon may be more liberal in the area of the brain he removes to ensure he has extracted all the cancer cells. This decision increases recall but reduces precision. On the other hand, the surgeon may be more conservative in the brain he removes to ensure he extracts only cancer cells. This decision increases precision but reduces recall. That is to say, greater recall increases the chances of removing healthy cells (negative outcome) and increases the chances of removing all cancer cells (positive outcome). Greater precision decreases the chances of removing healthy cells (positive outcome) but also decreases the chances of removing all cancer cells (negative outcome)."], "wikipedia-50716473": ["Section::::Offline metrics.:Precision.\nPrecision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are relevant to the user's information need.\nIn binary classification, precision is analogous to positive predictive value.

Now, let's define these two measures more precisely and how these measures are used to evaluate a set of retrieved documents.

We can distinguish the results in four cases, depending on the situation of a document as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:basicmeasure}.\nA document is either retrieved or not retrieved since we're talking about the \\emph{set} of results. The document can be also relevant or not relevant, depending on whether the user thinks this is a useful document. We now have counts of documents in each of the four categories.

Wikipedia's citations can guide users to further reading.", "wikipedia-515929": ["Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical technique of e-mail filtering. They typically use bag of words features to identify spam e-mail, an approach commonly used in text classification.\nNaive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam.\nNaive Bayes spam filtering is a baseline technique for dealing with spam that can tailor itself to the email needs of individual users and give low false positive spam detection rates that are generally acceptable to users. It is one of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering, with roots in the 1990s.\n\nParticular words have particular probabilities of occurring in spam email and in legitimate email. For instance, most email users will frequently encounter the word \"Viagra\" in spam email, but will seldom see it in other email. The filter doesn't know these probabilities in advance, and must first be trained so it can build them up. To train the filter, the user must manually indicate whether a new email is spam or not. For all words in each training email, the filter will adjust the probabilities that each word will appear in spam or legitimate email in its database. For instance, Bayesian spam filters will typically have learned a very high spam probability for the words \"Viagra\" and \"refinance\", but a very low spam probability for words seen only in legitimate email, such as the names of friends and family members.\nAfter training, the word probabilities (also known as likelihood functions) are used to compute the probability that an email with a particular set of words in it belongs to either category. Each word in the email contributes to the email's spam probability, or only the most interesting words. This contribution is called the posterior probability and is computed using Bayes' theorem. Then, the email's spam probability is computed over all words in the email, and if the total exceeds a certain threshold (say 95%), the filter will mark the email as a spam.\nAs in any other spam filtering technique, email marked as spam can then be automatically moved to a \"Junk\" email folder, or even deleted outright. Some software implement quarantine mechanisms that define a time frame during which the user is allowed to review the software's decision.\nThe initial training can usually be refined when wrong judgements from the software are identified (false positives or false negatives). That allows the software to dynamically adapt to the ever-evolving nature of spam.\nSome spam filters combine the results of both Bayesian spam filtering and other heuristics (pre-defined rules about the contents, looking at the message's envelope, etc.), resulting in even higher filtering accuracy, sometimes at the cost of adaptiveness."], "wikipedia-313737": ["isting technique is built on the fact that the SMTP protocol allows for temporary rejection of incoming messages. Greylisting temporarily rejects all messages from unknown senders or mail servers \u2013 using the standard 4xx error codes. All compliant MTAs will proceed to retry delivery later, but many spammers and spambots will not. The downside is that all legitimate messages from first-time senders will experience a delay in delivery.\nHELO/EHLO checking \u2013 says that an SMTP server \"MAY verify that the domain name argument in the EHLO command actually corresponds to the IP address of the client. However, if the verification fails, the server MUST NOT refuse to accept a message on that basis.\" Systems can, however, be configured to \nBULLET::::- Refuse connections from hosts that give an invalid HELO \u2013 for example, a HELO that is not an FQDN or is an IP address not surrounded by square brackets.\nBULLET::::- Refusing connections from hosts that give an obviously fraudulent HELO\nBULLET::::- Refusing to accept email whose HELO/EHLO argument does not resolve in DNS\nInvalid pipelining \u2013 Several SMTP commands are allowed to be placed in one network packet and \"pipelined\". For example, if an email is sent with a CC: header, several SMTP \"RCPT TO\" commands might be placed in a single packet instead of one packet per \"RCPT TO\" command. The SMTP protocol, however, requires that errors be checked and everything is synchronized at certain points. Many spammers will send everything in a single packet since they do not care about errors and it is more efficient. Some MTAs will detect this invalid pipelining and reject email sent this way.\nNolisting \u2013 The email servers for any given domain are specified in a prioritized list, via the MX records. The nolisting technique is simply the adding of an MX record pointing to a non-existent server as the \"primary\" (i.e. that with the lowest preference value) \u2013 which means that an initial mail contact will always fail. Many spam sources do not retry on failure, so the spammer will move on to the next victim; legitimate email servers should retry the next higher numbered MX, and normal email will be delivered with only a brief delay.\nQuit detection \u2013 An SMTP connection should always be closed with a QUIT command. Many spammers skip this step because their spam has already been sent and taking the time to properly close the connection takes time and bandwidth. Some MTAs are capable of detecting whether or not the connection is closed correctly and use this as a measure of how trustworthy the other system is.\nSection::::Automated techniques for email administrators.:Honeypots.\nAnother approach is simply an imitation MTA which gives the appearance of being an open mail relay, or an imitation TCP/IP proxy server which gives the appearance of being an open proxy. Spammers who probe systems for open relays/proxies will find such a host and attempt to send mail through it, wasting their time and resources and potentially revealing information about themselves and the origin of the spam they are sending to the entity that operates the honeypot. Such a system may simply discard the spam attempts, submit them to DNSBLs, or store them for analysis.\nSection::::Automated techniques for email administrators.:Hybrid filtering.\nSpamAssassin, Policyd-weight and others use some or all of the various tests for spam, and assigns a numerical score to each test. Each message is scanned for these patterns, and the applicable scores tallied up. If the total is above a fixed value, the message is rejected or flagged as spam. By ensuring that no single spam test by itself can flag a message as spam, the false positive rate can be greatly reduced.\nSection::::Automated techniques for email administrators.:Outbound spam protection.\nOutbound spam protection involves scanning email traffic as it exits a network, identifying spam messages and then taking an action such as blocking the message or shutting off the source of the traffic. While the primary impact of spam is on spam recipients, sending networks also experience financial costs, such as wasted bandwidth, and the risk of having their IP addresses blocked by receiving networks.\nOutbound spam protection not only stops spam, but also lets system administrators track down spam sources on their network and remediate them\u00a0\u2013 for example, clearing malware from machines which have become infected with a virus or are participating in a botnet.\nSection::::Automated techniques for email administrators.:PTR/reverse DNS checks.\nThe PTR DNS records in the reverse DNS can be used for a number of things, including:\nBULLET::::- Most email mail transfer agents (mail servers) use a forward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS) verification and if there is a valid domain name, put it into the \"Received:\" trace header field.\nBULLET::::- Some email mail transfer agents will perform FCrDNS verification on the domain name given in the SMTP HELO and EHLO commands. See #HELO/EHLO checking.\nBULLET::::- To check the domain names in the rDNS to see if they are likely from dial-up users, dynamically assigned addresses, or home-based broadband customers. Since the vast majority of email that originates from these computers is spam, many mail servers also refuse email with missing or \"generic\" rDNS names.\nBULLET::::- A Forward Confirmed reverse DNS verification can create a form of authentication that there is a valid relationship between the owner of a domain name and the owner of the network that has been given an IP address. While reliant on the DNS infrastructure, which has known vulnerabilities, this authentication is strong enough that it can be used for whitelisting purposes because spammers and phishers cannot usually bypass this verification when they use zombie computers to forge the domains.\nSection::::Automated techniques for email administrators.:Rule-based filtering.\nContent filtering techniques rely on the specification of lists of words or regular expressions disallowed in mail messages. Thus, if a site receives spam advertising \"herbal Viagra\", the administrator might place this phrase in the filter configuration. The mail server would then reject any message containing the phrase.\nHeader filtering looks at the header of the email which contains information about the origin, destination and content of the message. Although spammers will often spoof fields in the header in order to hide their identity, or to try to make the email look more legitimate than it is many of these spoofing methods can be detected, and any violation of the RFC 5322 standard on how the header is to be formed can also serve as a basis for rejecting the message.\nSection::::Automated techniques for email administrators.:SMTP callback verification.\nSince a large percentage of spam has forged and invalid sender (\"from\") addresses, some spam can be detected by checking that this \"from\" address is valid. A mail server can try to verify the sender address by making an SMTP connection back to the mail exchanger for the address, as if it was creating a bounce, but stopping just before any email is sent.\nCallback verification has various drawbacks: (1) Since nearly all spam has forged return addresses, nearly all callbacks are to innocent third party mail servers that are unrelated to the spam; (2) When the spammer uses a trap address as his sender's address. If the receiving MTA tries to make the callback using the trap address in a MAIL FROM command, the receiving MTA's IP address will be blacklisted; (3) Finally, the standard VRFY and EXPN commands used to verify an address have been so exploited by spammers that few mail administrators enable them, leaving the receiving SMTP server no effective way to validate the sender's email address.\nSection::::Automated techniques for email administrators.:SMTP proxy.\nSMTP proxies allow combating spam in real time, combining sender's behavior controls, providing legitimate users immediate feedback, eliminating a need for quarantine.\nSection::::Automated techniques for email administrators.:Spamtrapping.\nSpamtrapping is the seeding of an email address so that spammers can find it, but normal users can not. If the email address is used then the sender must be a spammer and they are black listed.\nAs an example, if the email address \"spamtrap@example.org\" is placed in the source HTML of a web site in a way that it isn't displayed on the web page, human visitors to the website would not see it. Spammers, on the other hand, use web page scrapers and bots to harvest email addresses from HTML source code - so they would find this address. When the spammer later sends to the address the spamtrap knows this is highly likely to be a spammer and can take appropriate action.\nSection::::Automated techniques for email administrators.:Statistical content filtering.\nStatistical, or Bayesian, filtering once set up requires no administrative maintenance per se: instead, users mark messages as \"spam\" or \"nonspam\" and the filtering software learns from these judgements. Thus, it is matched to the \"end user's\" needs, and as long as users consistently mark/tag the emails, can respond quickly to changes in spam content. Statistical filters typically also look at message headers, considering not just the content but also peculiarities of the transport mechanism of the email.\nSoftware programs that implement statistical filtering include Bogofilter, DSPAM, SpamBayes, ASSP, CRM114, the email programs Mozilla and Mozilla Thunderbird, Mailwasher, and later revisions of SpamAssassin.\nSection::::Automated techniques for email administrators.:Tarpits.\nA \"tarpit\" is any server software which intentionally responds extremely slowly to client commands...."], "wikipedia-287952": ["Spammers abuse vulnerable resources such as open mail relays and open proxies. These are servers which accept e-mail from anyone on the Internet\u2014including spammers\u2014and send it to its destination. Some system administrators have created honeypot programs that masquerade as these abusable resources to discover spammer activity.\n\nThere are several capabilities such honeypots provide to these administrators, and the existence of such fake abusable systems makes abuse more difficult or risky. Honeypots can be a powerful countermeasure to abuse from those who rely on very high volume abuse (e.g., spammers).\n\nThese honeypots can reveal the abuser's IP address and provide bulk spam capture (which enables operators to determine spammers' URLs and response mechanisms). As described by M. Edwards at ITPRo Today:\n\nThe apparent source may be another abused system. Spammers and other abusers may use a chain of such abused systems to make detection of the original starting point of the abuse traffic difficult.\n\nThis in itself is indicative of the power of honeypots as anti-spam tools. In the early days of anti-spam honeypots, spammers, with little concern for hiding their location, felt safe testing for vulnerabilities and sending spam directly from their own systems. Honeypots made the abuse riskier and more difficult.\n\nSpam still flows through open relays, but the volume is much smaller than in 2001-02. While most spam originates in the U.S., spammers hop through open relays across political boundaries to mask their origin. Honeypot operators may use intercepted relay tests to recognize and thwart attempts to relay spam through their honeypots. \"Thwart\" may mean \"accept the relay spam but decline to deliver it.\" Honeypot operators may discover other details concerning the spam and the spammer by examining the captured spam messages.\n\nOpen relay honeypots include Jackpot, written in Java by Jack Cleaver; \"smtpot.py\", written in Python by Karl A. Krueger; and \"spamhole (honeypot)|spamhole\", written in C. The \"Bubblegum Proxypot\" is an open source honeypot (or \"proxypot\").\n\nAn email address that is not used for any other purpose than to receive spam can also be considered a spam honeypot. Compared with the term \"spamtrap\", the term \"honeypot\" might be more suitable for systems and techniques that are used to detect or counterattack probes. With a spamtrap, spam arrives at its destination \"legitimately\"\u2014exactly as non-spam email would arrive.\n\nAn amalgam of these techniques is Project Honey Pot, a distributed, open source project that uses honeypot pages installed on websites around the world. These honeypot pages disseminate uniquely tagged spamtrap email addresses and spammers can then be tracked\u2014the corresponding spam mail is subsequently sent to these spamtrap e-mail addresses."]}, "textbook/textdatabook": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Specifically, humans can help select the most relevant data to a particular application problem, which is beneficial since it enables us to avoid processing the huge amount of raw text data (which would be inefficient) and focus on analyzing the most relevant part. Selecting relevant text data from a large collection is the basic task of text access. This selection is generally based on a specification of the information need of an analyst (a user), and can be done in two modes: pull and push.\n\nIn pull mode, the user initiates the access process to find the relevant text data, typically by using a search engine. This mode of text access is essential when a user has an ad hoc information need, \\ie, a temporary information need that might disappear once the need is satisfied. In such a case, the user can use a query to find relevant information with a search engine. For example, a user may have a need to buy a product and thus be interested in retrieving all the relevant opinions about candidate products; after the user has purchased the product, the user would generally no longer need such information. Another example is that during the process of analyzing social media data to understand opinions about an emerging event, the analyst may also decide to explore information about a particular entity related to the event (\\eg, a person), which can also trigger a search activity.\nWhile querying is the most common way of accessing text data in the pull mode, browsing is another complementary way of accessing text data in the pull mode, and can be very useful when a user does not know how to formulate an effective query, or finds it inconvenient to enter a keyword query (\\eg, through a smartphone), or simply wants to explore a topic with no fixed goal. Indeed, when searching the Web, users tend to mix querying and browsing (\\eg, while traversing through hyperlinks).\n\nIn general, we may regard querying and browsing as two complementary ways of finding relevant information in the information space. Their relation can be understood by making an analogy between information seeking and sightseeing in a physical world. When a tourist knows the exact address of an attraction, the tourist can simply take a taxi directly to the attraction; this is similar to when a user knows exactly what he or she is looking for and can formulate a query with the ``right keywords'', which would bring to the user relevant pages directly. However, if a tourist doesn't know the exact address of an attraction, the tourist may want to take a taxi to an approximate location and then {\\em walk} around to find the attraction. Similarly, if a user does not have a good knowledge about the target pages, he or she can also use an approximate query to reach some related pages and then {\\em browse} into truly relevant information. Thus, when querying does not work well, browsing can be very useful.\n\nIn the push mode, the system initiates the process to recommend a set of relevant information items to the user. This mode of information access is generally more useful to satisfy a long-standing information need of a user or analyst. For example, a researcher's research interests can be regarded as relatively stable over time. In comparison, the information stream (\\ie, published research articles) is dynamic. In such a scenario, although a user can regularly search for relevant literature information with queries, it is more desirable for a recommender (also called filtering) system to monitor the dynamic information stream and ``push'' any relevant articles to the user based on the matching of the articles with the user's interests (\\eg, in the form of an email). In some long-term analytics applications, it would also be desirable to use the push mode to monitor any relevant text data (such as relevant social media) about a topic related to the application.\nAnother scenario of push mode is producer-initiated recommendation, which can be more appropriately called selective dissemination of information (SDI). In such a scenario, the producer of information has an interest in disseminating the information among relevant users, and would push an information item to such users. Advertising of product information on search result pages is such an example.

We are also usually concerned about accuracy, which is defined as the number of correct categorization decisions made by the system divided by the total number of categorization decisions made by the system. Since the accuracy measure does not distinguish different types of categorization errors, it is not appropriate to use it on a data set that has skewed distributions of instances in different classes. For example, in a binary categorization problem, if one category is much more popular than the other, than a trivial baseline that simply puts all instances in the category would have a pretty high categorization accuracy. To more appropriately evaluate such a categorization task, we can examine the categorization performance for each category. For example, we may treat the categorization results for each category as ``retrieval'' results for a query corresponding to the category and apply typical measures used in retrieval such as precision, recall and F measure to quantify the performance in a per-category manner. Readers can find more discussion about this in the reference \\cite{Yang:99}. Training and testing splits were mentioned in the previous sections, but another partition of the total corpus is also sometimes used; this is the \\textbf{development set}, used for parameter tuning. Typically a corpus is split into about $80\\%$ training, $10\\%$ development, and $10\\%$ testing. For example, consider the problem of determining a good $k$ value for $k$-NN. An index is created over the training documents, for (\\eg) $k=5$. The accuracy is determined using the development documents. This is repeated for $k=10,15,20,25$. The best-performing $k$-value is then finally run on the testing set to find the overall accuracy. The purpose of the development set is to prevent \\textbf{overfitting}, or tailoring the learning algorithm too much to a particular corpus subset and losing generality. A trained model is \\textbf{robust} if it is not prone to overfitting. Another evaluation paradigm is $n$-fold \\textbf{cross validation}. This splits the corpus into $n$ partitions. In $n$ rounds, one partition is selected as the testing set and the remaining $n-1$ are used for training. The final accuracy, $F_1$ score, or any other evaluation metric is then averaged over the $n$ folds. The variance in scores between the folds can be a hint at the overfitting potential of your algorithm. If the variance is high, it means that the accuracies are not very similar between folds. Having one fold with a very high accuracy suggests that your learning algorithm may have overfit during that training stage; when using that trained algorithm on a separate corpus, it's likely that the accuracy would be very low since it modeled noise or other uninformative features from that particular split (\\ie, it overfit). Another important concept is \\textbf{baseline accuracy}. This represents the minimum score to ``beat'' when using your classifier. Say there are 3000 documents consisting of three classes, each with 1000 documents. In this case, random guessing would give you about $33\\%$ accuracy, since you'd be correct approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the time. Your classifier would have to do better than $33\\%$ accuracy in order to make it useful! In another example, consider the 3000 documents and three classes, but with an uneven class distribution: one class has 2000 documents and the other two classes have 500 each. In this case, the baseline accuracy is $66\\%$, since picking the majority class label will result in correct predictions $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the time. Thus, it's important to take class imbalances into consideration when evaluating a classifier. A \\textbf{confusion matrix} is a way to examine a classifier's performance at a per-label level. Consider Figure~\\ref{fig:conf-matrix}, the output from running \\meta~on a three-class classification problem to determine the native language of the author of English text. Each $(row, column)$ index in the table shows the fraction of times that $row$ was classified as $column$. Therefore, the rows all sum to one. The diagonal represents the true positive rate, and hopefully most of the probability mass lies here, indicating a good classifier."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/2": ["There are two main reasons; the first is that we have to use evaluation to figure out which retrieval method works the best.

Log-likelihood and model perplexity are two common evaluation measures used by language models, and they can be applied for topic analysis in the same way. Both are predictive measures, meaning that held-out data is presented to the model and the model is applied to this new information, calculating its likelihood. If the model generalizes well to this new data (by assigning it a high likelihood or low perplexity), then the model is assumed to be sufficient. Downstream task improvement is perhaps the most effective (and transparent) evaluation metric. If a different topic analysis variant is shown to statistically significantly improve some task precision, then an argument may be made to prefer the new model. For example, if the topic analysis is meant to produce new features for text categorization, then classification accuracy is the metric we'd wish to improve.

It can assist an organization, program, design, project or any other intervention or initiative to assess any aim, realisable concept/proposal, or any alternative, to help in decision-making; or to ascertain the degree of achievement or value in regard to the aim and objectives and results of any such action that has been completed. The primary purpose of evaluation, in addition to gaining insight into prior or existing initiatives, is to enable reflection and assist in the identification of future change.\n\nEvaluation is the structured interpretation and giving of meaning to predicted or actual impacts of proposals or results. It looks at original objectives, and at what is either predicted or what was accomplished and how it was accomplished. So evaluation can be formative, that is taking place during the development of a concept or proposal, project or organization, with the intention of improving the value or effectiveness of the proposal, project, or organisation. It can also be summative, drawing lessons from a completed action or project or an organisation at a later point in time or circumstance.\n\nEvaluation is inherently a theoretically informed approach (whether explicitly or not), and consequently any particular definition of evaluation would have been tailored to its contextthe theory, needs, purpose, and methodology of the evaluation process itself. Having said this, evaluation has been defined as:\nBULLET::::- A systematic, rigorous, and meticulous application of scientific methods to assess the design, implementation, improvement, or outcomes of a program. It is a resource-intensive process, frequently requiring resources, such as, evaluate expertise, labor, time, and a sizable budget\nBULLET::::- \"The critical assessment, in as objective a manner as possible, of the degree to which a service or its component parts fulfills stated goals\" (St Leger and Wordsworth-Bell). The focus of this definition is on attaining objective knowledge, and scientifically or quantitatively measuring predetermined and external concepts.\nBULLET::::- \"A study designed to assist some audience to assess an object's merit and worth\" (Stufflebeam). In this definition the focus is on facts as well as value laden judgments of the programs outcomes and worth.\n\nThe main purpose of a program evaluation can be to \"determine the quality of a program by formulating a judgment\" Marthe Hurteau, Sylvain Houle, St\u00e9phanie Mongiat (2009).\n\nAn alternative view is that \"projects, evaluators, and other stakeholders (including funders) will all have potentially different ideas about how best to evaluate a project since each may have a different definition of 'merit'. The core of the problem is thus about defining what is of value.\"\n\nFrom this perspective, evaluation \"is a contested term\", as \"evaluators\" use the term evaluation to describe an assessment, or investigation of a program whilst others simply understand evaluation as being synonymous with applied research.\n\nThere are two function considering to the evaluation purpose Formative Evaluations provide the information on the improving a product or a process Summative Evaluations provide information of short-term effectiveness or long-term impact to deciding the adoption of a product or process.\n\nNot all evaluations serve the same purpose some evaluations serve a monitoring function rather than focusing solely on measurable program outcomes or evaluation findings and a full list of types of evaluations would be difficult to compile.

One metric that is often used is called the $F_{\\beta}$ measure, displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:f-measure}. In the case where $\\beta=1$, it's a harmonic mean of precision and recall. Considering the parameter $\\beta$ and after some simplification, we can see the $F$ measure may be written in the form on the righthand side of the figure. Often, $\\beta$ set to one, which indicates an equal preference towards precision and recall. In the case where $\\beta=1$, we have a special case of the $F$ measure, often called $F_1$. This is a popular measure, that is often used as a combined precision and recall score. If $\\beta$ is not equal to one, it controls the emphasis between precision and recall. It's easy to see that if you have a large precision or large recall than the $F_1$ measure would be high. But what's interesting is how the tradeoff between precision and recall is captured in the $F_1$ score. In order to understand the formulation, we can first ask the natural question: \\emph{Why not combine them using a simple arithmetic mean?} That would be likely the most natural way of combining them. Why is this not as good as $F_1$, \\ie, what's the problem with an arithmetic mean? The arithmetic mean's denominator tends to be dominated by large values. That means if you have a very high $P$ or a very high $R$, then you really don't care about whether the other value is low since the whole sum would be high. This is not the desirable effect because one can easily have a perfect recall by returning all the documents! Then we have a perfect recall and a low precision. This will still give a relatively high average. Such search results are clearly not very useful for users even though the average using this formula would be relatively high. In contrast, the $F_1$ score will reward a case where precision and recall are roughly similar. So, it would penalize a case with an extremely high result for only one of them. This means $F_1$ encodes a different tradeoff between them than a simple arithmetic mean. This example shows a very important methodology: when we try to solve a problem, you might naturally think of one solution. (\\eg, the arithmetic mean), but it's important not to settle on this solution; rather, think whether there are other ways to approach it. Once you have multiple ideas, it's important to analyze their differences and then think about which one makes more sense in a real scenario. To summarize, we talked about precision, which addresses the question: are the retrieval results all relevant? We also talked about recall, which addresses the question: have all the relevant documents been retrieved? These two are the two basic measures in information retrieval evaluation. They are used for many other tasks as well. We talked about $F$ measure as a way to combine precision and recall. We also talked about the tradeoff between precision and recall, and it turns out to depend on the users' search tasks and preferences."], "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/evaluation.jsonl/2": ["As with information retrieval evaluation, we can use precision, recall, and $F_1$ score by considering true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. We are also usually concerned about accuracy, which is defined as the number of correct categorization decisions made by the system divided by the total number of categorization decisions made by the system. Since the accuracy measure does not distinguish different types of categorization errors, it is not appropriate to use it on a data set that has skewed distributions of instances in different classes. For example, in a binary categorization problem, if one category is much more popular than the other, than a trivial baseline that simply puts all instances in the category would have a pretty high categorization accuracy. To more appropriately evaluate such a categorization task, we can examine the categorization performance for each category. For example, we may treat the categorization results for each category as ``retrieval'' results for a query corresponding to the category and apply typical measures used in retrieval such as precision, recall and F measure to quantify the performance in a per-category manner."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Brain surgery provides an illustrative example of the tradeoff. Consider a brain surgeon tasked with removing a cancerous tumor from a patient\u2019s brain. The surgeon needs to remove all of the tumor cells since any remaining cancer cells will regenerate the tumor. Conversely, the surgeon must not remove healthy brain cells since that would leave the patient with impaired brain function. The surgeon may be more liberal in the area of the brain he removes to ensure he has extracted all the cancer cells. This decision increases recall but reduces precision. On the other hand, the surgeon may be more conservative in the brain he removes to ensure he extracts only cancer cells. This decision increases precision but reduces recall. That is to say, greater recall increases the chances of removing healthy cells (negative outcome) and increases the chances of removing all cancer cells (positive outcome). Greater precision decreases the chances of removing healthy cells (positive outcome) but also decreases the chances of removing all cancer cells (negative outcome).\n\nUsually, precision and recall scores are not discussed in isolation. Instead, either values for one measure are compared for a fixed level at the other measure (e.g. \"precision at a recall level of 0.75\") or both are combined into a single measure. Examples of measures that are a combination of precision and recall are the F-measure (the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall), or the Matthews correlation coefficient, which is a geometric mean of the chance-corrected variants: the regression coefficients Informedness (DeltaP') and Markedness (DeltaP). Accuracy is a weighted arithmetic mean of Precision and Inverse Precision (weighted by Bias) as well as a weighted arithmetic mean of Recall and Inverse Recall (weighted by Prevalence). Inverse Precision and Inverse Recall are simply the Precision and Recall of the inverse problem where positive and negative labels are exchanged (for both real classes and prediction labels). Recall and Inverse Recall, or equivalently true positive rate and false positive rate, are frequently plotted against each other as ROC curves and provide a principled mechanism to explore operating point tradeoffs."], "wikipedia-4011785": ["In statistical analysis of binary classification, the F score (also F-score or F-measure) is a measure of a test's accuracy. It considers both the precision \"p\" and the recall \"r\" of the test to compute the score: \"p\" is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, and \"r\" is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive). The F score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall, where an F score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0.\nThe traditional F-measure or balanced F-score (F score) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:\nThe general formula for positive real \u03b2 is:\nThe formula in terms of Type I and type II errors:\nTwo other commonly used F measures are the formula_4 measure, which weighs recall higher than precision (by placing more emphasis on false negatives), and the formula_5 measure, which weighs recall lower than precision (by attenuating the influence of false negatives).\nThe F-measure was derived so that formula_6 \"measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches \u03b2 times as much importance to recall as precision\". It is based on Van Rijsbergen's effectiveness measure\nTheir relationship is formula_8 where formula_9.\nThe F score is also known as the S\u00f8rensen\u2013Dice coefficient or Dice similarity coefficient (DSC).\nThis is related to the field of binary classification where recall is often termed as Sensitivity. There are several reasons that the F score can be criticized in particular circumstances.\nThe F-score is often used in the field of information retrieval for measuring search, document classification, and query classification performance. Earlier works focused primarily on the F score, but with the proliferation of large scale search engines, performance goals changed to place more emphasis on either precision or recall and so formula_6 is seen in wide application.\nThe F-score is also used in machine learning. Note, however, that the F-measures do not take the true negatives into account, and that measures such as the Matthews correlation coefficient, Informedness or Cohen's kappa may be preferable to assess the performance of a binary classifier.\nThe F-score has been widely used in the natural language processing literature, such as the evaluation of named entity recognition and word segmentation."], "wikipedia-43218024": ["Sensitivity or True Positive Rate (TPR), also known as recall, is the proportion of people that tested positive and are positive (True Positive, TP) of all the people that actually are positive (Condition Positive, CP = TP + FN). It can be seen as \"the probability that the test is positive given that the patient is sick\". With higher sensitivity, fewer actual cases of disease go undetected (or, in the case of the factory quality control, fewer faulty products go to the market).\nSpecificity (SPC) or True Negative Rate (TNR) is the proportion of people that tested negative and are negative (True Negative, TN) of all the people that actually are negative (Condition Negative, CN = TN + FP). As with sensitivity, it can be looked at as \"the probability that the test result is negative given that the patient is not sick\". With higher specificity, fewer healthy people are labeled as sick (or, in the factory case, fewer good products are discarded).\nThe positive prediction value answers the question \"If the test result is \"positive\", how well does that \"predict\" an actual presence of disease?\". It is calculated as TP/(TP + FP); that is, it is the proportion of true positives out of all positive results. The negative prediction value is the same, but for negatives, naturally.\nPerhaps the simplest statistic is accuracy or Fraction Correct (FC), which measures the fraction of all instances that are correctly categorized; it is the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the total number of correct or incorrect classifications: (TP + TN)/Total Population = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN). This is often not very useful, compared to the marginal ratios, as it does not yield useful marginal interpretations, due to mixing true positives (test positive, condition positive) and true negatives (test negative, condition negative) \u2013 in terms of the condition table, it sums the diagonal; further, it is prevalence-dependent. The complement is the Fraction Incorrect (FiC): FC + FiC = 1, or (FP + FN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN) \u2013 this is the sum of the antidiagonal, divided by the total population."]}, "textbook/textdatabook": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2. The query can be answered using a relevant textbook on machine learning, information retrieval, or text mining, as these topics are standard in such texts. Textbooks typically define and explain evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and averaging methods (micro/macro) in the context of classification tasks, including text categorization. They also provide examples and discuss their significance in model evaluation.", "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/4": ["There tends to be a tradeoff between precision and recall, so it is natural to\ncombine them. One metric that is often used is called the $F_{\\beta}$ measure,\ndisplayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:f-measure}. In the case where $\\beta=1$, it's a\nharmonic mean of precision and recall.\nConsidering the parameter $\\beta$ and after some simplification, we can see the\n$F$ measure may be written in the form on the righthand side of the figure.\nOften, $\\beta$ set to one, which indicates an equal preference towards precision\nand recall.  In the case where $\\beta=1$, we have a special case of the $F$\nmeasure, often called $F_1$. This is a popular measure, that is often used as a\ncombined precision and recall score. If $\\beta$ is not equal to one, it controls\nthe emphasis between precision and recall. It's easy to see that if you have a\nlarge precision or large recall than the $F_1$ measure would be high. But what's\ninteresting is how the tradeoff between precision and recall is captured in the\n$F_1$ score.\nIn order to understand the formulation, we can first ask the natural question:\n\\emph{Why not combine them using a simple arithmetic mean?} That would be likely\nthe most natural way of combining them. Why is this not as good as $F_1$, \\ie,\nwhat's the problem with an arithmetic mean?\nThe arithmetic mean's denominator tends to be dominated by large values. That\nmeans if you have a very high $P$ or a very high $R$, then you really don't care\nabout whether the other value is low since the whole sum would be high. This is\nnot the desirable effect because one can easily have a perfect recall by\nreturning all the documents! Then we have a perfect recall and a low precision.\nThis will still give a relatively high average. Such search results are clearly\nnot very useful for users even though the average using this formula would be\nrelatively high. In contrast, the $F_1$ score will reward a case where precision\nand recall are roughly similar. So, it would penalize a case with an extremely\nhigh result for only one of them. This means $F_1$ encodes a different tradeoff\nbetween them than a simple arithmetic mean. This example shows a very important\nmethodology: when we try to solve a problem, you might naturally think of one\nsolution. (\\eg, the arithmetic mean), but it's important not to settle on this\nsolution; rather, think whether there are other ways to approach it. Once you have\nmultiple ideas, it's important to analyze their differences and then think about\nwhich one makes more sense in a real scenario.\nTo summarize, we talked about precision, which addresses the question: are the\nretrieval results all relevant? We also talked about recall, which addresses the\nquestion: have all the relevant documents been retrieved? These two are the two\nbasic measures in information retrieval evaluation. They are used for many\nother tasks as well. We talked about $F$ measure as a way to combine precision\nand recall. We also talked about the tradeoff between precision and recall, and\nit turns out to depend on the users' search tasks and preferences."], "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/evaluation.jsonl/2": ["As with information retrieval evaluation, we can use precision, recall, and $F_1$ score by considering true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. We are also usually concerned about accuracy, which is defined as the number of correct categorization decisions made by the system divided by the total number of categorization decisions made by the system. Since the accuracy measure does not distinguish different types of categorization errors, it is not appropriate to use it on a data set that has skewed distributions of instances in different classes. For example, in a binary categorization problem, if one category is much more popular than the other, than a trivial baseline that simply puts all instances in the category would have a pretty high categorization accuracy. To more appropriately evaluate such a categorization task, we can examine the categorization performance for each category. For example, we may treat the categorization results for each category as ``retrieval'' results for a query corresponding to the category and apply typical measures used in retrieval such as precision, recall and F measure to quantify the performance in a per-category manner."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-50716473": 2, "wikipedia-14343887": 2, "wikipedia-41932": 1, "wikipedia-3772276": 1, "wikipedia-11336666": 1, "wikipedia-4011785": 1, "wikipedia-731658": 1, "wikipedia-1906608": 1, "wikipedia-43218024": 1, "wikipedia-637199": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/4": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/evaluation.jsonl/2": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/summarization/evaluation.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/8": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/recommender-systems/evaluation.jsonl/2": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/exercises.jsonl/4": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/evaluation.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/evaluation.jsonl/1": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/exercises.jsonl/2": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-50716473": 3, "wikipedia-14343887": 3, "wikipedia-41932": 1, "wikipedia-3772276": 1, "wikipedia-11336666": 1, "wikipedia-4011785": 2, "wikipedia-731658": 1, "wikipedia-1906608": 1, "wikipedia-43218024": 2, "wikipedia-637199": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/set-retrieval.jsonl/4": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/evaluation.jsonl/2": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/summarization/evaluation.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/8": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/recommender-systems/evaluation.jsonl/2": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/exercises.jsonl/4": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/evaluation.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/evaluation.jsonl/1": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/exercises.jsonl/2": 1}}}
