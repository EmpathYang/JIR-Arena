Areas of focus include representation of the process flow, the factors within it, alerts and notifications, escalations, standard operating procedures, service level agreements, and task hand-over mechanisms. Whether or not existing processes are considered, the aim of this step is to ensure a correct and efficient new design.\nThe proposed improvement could be in human-to-human, human-to-system or system-to-system workflows, and might target regulatory, market, or competitive challenges faced by the businesses. Existing processes and design of a new process for various applications must synchronize and not cause a major outage or process interruption.\nModeling takes the theoretical design and introduces combinations of variables (e.g., changes in rent or materials costs, which determine how the process might operate under different circumstances).\nIt may also involve running \"what-if analysis\"(Conditions-when, if, else) on the processes: \"\"What if I have 75% of resources to do the same task?\"\" \"\"What if I want to do the same job for 80% of the current cost?\"\".\nBusiness process execution is broadly about enacting a discovered and modeled business process. Enacting a business process is done manually or automatically or with a combination of manual and automated business tasks. Manual business processes are human-driven. Automated business processes are software-driven. Business process automation encompasses methods and software deployed for automating business processes.\nBusiness process automation is performed and orchestrated at the business process layer or the consumer presentation layer of SOA Reference Architecture. BPM software suites such as BPMS or iBPMS or low-code platforms are positioned at the business process layer. While the emerging robotic process automation software performs business process automation at the presentation layer, therefore is considered non-invasive to and de-coupled from existing application systems.\nOne of the ways to automate processes is to develop or purchase an application that executes the required steps of the process; however, in practice, these applications rarely execute all the steps of the process accurately or completely. Another approach is to use a combination of software and human intervention; however this approach is more complex, making the documentation process difficult.\nIn response to these problems, companies have developed software that defines the full business process (as developed in the process design activity) in a computer language that a computer can directly execute. Process models can be run through execution engines that automate the processes directly from the model (e.g., calculating a repayment plan for a loan) or, when a step is too complex to automate, Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) provides front-end capability for human input. Compared to either of the previous approaches, directly executing a process definition can be more straightforward and therefore easier to improve. However, automating a process definition requires flexible and comprehensive infrastructure, which typically rules out implementing these systems in a legacy IT environment.\nBusiness rules have been used by systems to provide definitions for governing behavior, and a business rule engine can be used to drive process execution and resolution.\nMonitoring encompasses the tracking of individual processes, so that information on their state can be easily seen, and statistics on the performance of one or more processes can be provided. An example of this tracking is being able to determine the state of a customer order \"(e.g.\" order arrived, awaiting delivery, invoice paid) so that problems in its operation can be identified and corrected.\nIn addition, this information can be used to work with customers and suppliers to improve their connected processes. Examples are the generation of measures on how quickly a customer order is processed or how many orders were processed in the last month. These measures tend to fit into three categories: cycle time, defect rate and productivity.\nThe degree of monitoring depends on what information the business wants to evaluate and analyze and how the business wants it monitored, in real-time, near real-time or ad hoc. Here, business activity monitoring (BAM) extends and expands the monitoring tools generally provided by BPMS.\nProcess mining is a collection of methods and tools related to process monitoring. The aim of process mining is to analyze event logs extracted through process monitoring and to compare them with an \"\" process model. Process mining allows process analysts to detect discrepancies between the actual process execution and the \"a priori\" model as well as to analyze bottlenecks.\nPredictive Business Process Monitoring concerns the application of data mining, machine learning, and other forecasting techniques to predict what is going to happen."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. **Yes**  \n2. arXiv papers often contain in-depth methodological explanations, workflows, and theoretical underpinnings of various techniques across disciplines.

Once the task is complete, WfMS ensures that the individuals responsible for the next task are notified and receive the data they need to execute their stage of the process.\nWorkflows can also have more complex dependencies; for example if a document is to be translated into several languages, a translation manager could select the languages and each selection would then be activated as a work order form for a different translator.

BPM focuses on improving corporate performance by managing business processes. Any combination of methods used to manage a company's business processes is BPM. Processes can be structured and repeatable or unstructured and variable. Though not required, enabling technologies are often used with BPM.\n\nBusiness process management activities can be arbitrarily grouped into categories such as design, modeling, execution, monitoring, and optimization.\n\nSection::::Life-cycle.:Design.\nProcess design encompasses both the identification of existing processes and the design of \"to-be\" processes. Areas of focus include representation of the process flow, the factors within it, alerts and notifications, escalations, standard operating procedures, service level agreements, and task hand-over mechanisms. Whether or not existing processes are considered, the aim of this step is to ensure a correct and efficient new design.\n\nThe proposed improvement could be in human-to-human, human-to-system or system-to-system workflows, and might target regulatory, market, or competitive challenges faced by the businesses. Existing processes and design of a new process for various applications must synchronize and not cause a major outage or process interruption.\n\nSection::::Life-cycle.:Modeling.\nModeling takes the theoretical design and introduces combinations of variables (e.g., changes in rent or materials costs, which determine how the process might operate under different circumstances).\n\nIt may also involve running \"what-if analysis\"(Conditions-when, if, else) on the processes: \"\"What if I have 75% of resources to do the same task?\"\" \"\"What if I want to do the same job for 80% of the current cost?\"\".\n\nSection::::Life-cycle.:Execution.\nBusiness process execution is broadly about enacting a discovered and modeled business process.

These queries result in selected video stories specific to user interest . Conversely, there are companies that offer personalcasting services directly to news outlets - allowing the organizations to create customized, around-the-clock programs for listeners.\nBy personalizing the selection of stories and the platforms from which they are delivered, users are afforded a more individual and enhanced news experience based on their predilections. This is an especially beneficial application for people wanting to listen to personalized information during their commutes to and from work. According to a U.S. Census Bureau analysis, driving to work was the favored means of commute of nearly nine out of 10 American workers (87.7 percent), with most people (77 percent) driving alone.\nIn addition, algorithms can be created to follow a user\u2019s personalcast sessions to capture user interest.

Although having Google personalize search results based on what users searched previously may have its benefits, there are negatives that come with it.\n\nThe first model available is based on the users' historical searches and search locations. People are probably familiar with this model since they often find the results reflecting their current location and previous searches.\n\nThere is another way to personalize search results. In Bracha Shapira and Boaz Zabar's \"Personalized Search: Integrating Collaboration and Social Networks\", Shapira and Zabar focused on a model that utilizes a recommendation system. This model shows results of other users who have searched for similar keywords. The authors examined keyword search, the recommendation system, and the recommendation system with social network working separately and compares the results in terms of search quality.

The internet has made the transaction cost of obtaining information significantly lower than ever. However, human ability to process information has not expanded much. When facing overwhelming amount of information, consumers need a sophisticated tool to help them make high quality decisions. Two studies examined the effects of personalized screening and ordering tools, and the results show a positive correlation between personalized search and the quality of consumers' decisions."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Typically, a recommender system compares the user's profile to some reference characteristics. These characteristics may be related to item characteristics (content-based filtering) or the user's social environment and past behavior (collaborative filtering).\nThere are three cases of cold start :\nBULLET::::1.

Unless the platform achieves unusually good diversity and independence of opinions, one point of view will always dominate another in a particular community. As in the personalized recommendation scenario, the introduction of new users or new items can cause the cold start problem, as there will be insufficient data on these new entries for the collaborative filtering to work accurately. In order to make appropriate recommendations for a new user, the system must first learn the user's preferences by analysing past voting or rating activities. The collaborative filtering system requires a substantial number of users to rate a new item before that item can be recommended.\n\nSection::::Challenges.:Data sparsity.\nIn practice, many commercial recommender systems are based on large datasets. As a result, the user-item matrix used for collaborative filtering could be extremely large and sparse, which brings about the challenges in the performances of the recommendation.\nOne typical problem caused by the data sparsity is the cold start problem. As collaborative filtering methods recommend items based on users' past preferences, new users will need to rate sufficient number of items to enable the system to capture their preferences accurately and thus provides reliable recommendations.\nSimilarly, new items also have the same problem. When new items are added to the system, they need to be rated by a substantial number of users before they could be recommended to users who have similar tastes to the ones who rated them.

This additional information is referred to as the context.\nTaking contextual information into consideration, we will have additional dimension to the existing user-item rating matrix. As an instance, assume a music recommender system which provide different recommendations in corresponding to time of the day. In this case, it is possible a user have different preferences for a music in different time of a day. Thus, instead of using user-item matrix, we may use tensor of order 3 (or higher for considering other contexts) to represent context-sensitive users' preferences.\nIn order to take advantage of collaborative filtering and particularly neighborhood-based methods, approaches can be extended from two dimensional rating matrix into tensor of higher order. For this purpose, the approach is to find the most similar/like-minded users to a target user; one can extract and compute similarity of slices (e.g. item-time matrix) corresponding to each user. Unlike context-insensitive case for which similarity of two rating vectors are calculated, in the context-aware approaches, similarity of rating matrices corresponding to each user is calculated by using Pearson coefficients.After the most like-minded users are found, their corresponding ratings are aggregated to identify the set of items to be recommended to the target user.\nThe most important disadvantage of taking context into recommendation model is to be able to deal with larger dataset that contains much more missing values in comparison to user-item rating matrix. Therefore, similar to matrix factorization methods, tensor factorization techniques can be used to reduce dimensionality of original data before using any neighborhood-based methods.\n\nUser-item matrix is a basic foundation of traditional collaborative filtering techniques, and it suffers from data sparsity problem (i.e. cold start). As a consequence, except for user-item matrix, researchers are trying to gather more auxiliary information to help boost recommendation performance and develop personalized recommender systems. Generally, there are two popular auxiliary information: attribute information and interaction information. Attribute information describes a user's or an item's properties. For example, user attribute might include general profile (e.g. gender and age) and social contacts (e.g. followers or friends in social networks); Item attribute means properties like category, brand or content.

This could include recommendations for restaurants, museums, or other points of interest or events near the user's location.\nThese services take advantage of the increasing use of smartphones that store and provide the location information of their users alongside location-based social networks (LBSN), like Foursquare, Gowalla, Swarm, and Yelp. In addition to geosocial networking services, traditional online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are using the location information of their users to show and recommend upcoming events, posts, and local trends.\nIn addition to its value for users, this information is valuable for third-party companies to advertise products, hotels, places, and to forecast service demand such as the number of taxis needed in a part of a city.\nSection::::Background.\nRecommender systems are information filtering systems which attempt to predict the rating or preference that a user would give, based on ratings that similar users gave and ratings that the user gave on previous occasions. These systems have become increasingly popular and are used for movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general.\nSection::::Recommending new places.\nThe main objective of recommending new places is to provide a suggestion to a user to visit unvisited places like restaurants, museums, national parks or other points of interest. This type of recommendation is quite valuable, especially for those who are traveling to a new city and want the best experience during their trip. Location-based social networks or third-party advertising companies are willing to provide a recommendation not only based on previous check-ins and preferences but also using social links to suggest a not-visited point-of-interest. The implicit goal of this type of recommendation is to lift the user's burden of searching for an interesting place.\nOne of the first studies in this area was conducted in 2011. The idea behind this work was to leverage social influence and location influence and provide recommendations. The authors provide three types of scores:\nBULLET::::- Similar users: this score is proportional to the similarity in behavior of users for visiting places. Mathematically, the similarity score between two users is computed as follows:formula_1Where formula_2 denotes the probability of visiting place formula_3 by user formula_4. This value could be computed based on the idea of user-based collaborative filtering as below:formula_5\nBULLET::::- Similar friends: this score is calculated by the cosine similarity of users based on their mutual connections (i.e.: friendships) in social media. This similarity is proportional to the number of friends that two users have in common. It is calculated as:formula_6Where formula_7represent the set of friends and formula_8is the place set of user formula_4 (i.e.: places the user visited). The tuning parameter formula_10, which is between 0 and 1, controls importance of social similarity and visiting similarity of two users.\nBULLET::::- Geographical distance: This score is inversely proportional to the distance between the target place and the typical places that a user frequently visits. Other studies have shown that overall distribution of distances is similar to power-law distribution. The formula below calculates the probability of check-in for user formula_4 in place formula_3 according to its distance from all check-ins of user formula_4.formula_14\nThe aggregate of these three scores is defined as:formula_15Where the three terms correspond to recommender systems based on user preference, social influence and geographical influence, respectively. The two weighting parameters formula_16 and formula_17 formula_18 denote the relative importance of social influence and geographical influence compared to user preference.\nSection::::Recommending the next place.\nProviding a sequence of recommendations becomes increasingly complex, and must take into account each location, the time, weather, reachability, etc., before providing any suggestion. These are generally known as context-aware recommendations, and tend to provide places that other people (possibly the user's friends) visited following an initial visit to the location of the user's first recommendation.\nSection::::Recommending events and neighborhoods.\nThere are a vast number of temporary events being held in different locations. Detecting and recommending events that would be interesting to a user is a task which requires considerable profiling, both of the user's history of event preferences and those of the user's social circle. \nSection::::Recommending events and neighborhoods.:Social events.\nResearchers at a 2010 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) conference discussed the need of a reliable fine-grained dataset of previous user-attendance in order to provide social-event detection. User residence area and attended events were estimated from user mobile data. Six different strategies were designed and tested for event recommendation:\nBULLET::::- Popular events: the most-attended event.\nBULLET::::- Geographically close events: events close to user's residency area. The raw score of an event could be adjusted by a factor inversely proportional to the distance to the event.\nBULLET::::- Popular events in area: the most-attended events within certain neighborhoods.\nBULLET::::- TF-IDF (term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency): inspired by the popular approach in information retrieval, recommends events which may not be widely popular but are very popular within a local area.\nBULLET::::- The K-nearest locations: popular events in neighborhoods similar to the user's residence area. The similarity between two neighborhoods formula_3 and formula_20 could be defined as:formula_21where formula_22 represents number of individuals living in neighborhood formula_3 who attended event formula_24. The similarity measure is weighted by formula_25 and formula_26 which represent the number of events people living in neighborhoods formula_3 and formula_20 have attended. Similarly, formula_29represents number of users living in formula_3 or users living in formula_20. Having similarity of neighborhoods, one can predict the score of user formula_3 to an event formula_33 based on a similarity-weighted average of the similar locations' values:formula_34The scores of each pair-events can be predicted and those events recommended to users with the highest values.\nBULLET::::- The K-nearest events: the similarity of events is computed and top K-events are recommended that are similar to those that a user previously enjoyed.formula_35"], "wikipedia-43274058": ["Section::::Search-based recommendation.\nIn a search-based recommender, user feedback is given in terms of answers to questions which restrict the set of relevant items. An example of such a question is \"Which type of lens system do you prefer: fixed or exchangeable lenses?\". On the technical level, search-based recommendation scenarios can be implemented on the basis of constraint-based recommender systems. Constraint-based recommender systems are implemented on the basis of constraint search or different types of conjunctive query-based approaches.\nSection::::Navigation-based recommendation.\nIn a navigation-based recommender, user feedback is typically provided in terms of \"critiques\" which specify change requests regarding the item currently recommended to the user. Critiques are then used for the recommendation of the next \"candidate\" item. An example of a critique in the context of a digital camera recommendation scenario is \"I would like to have a camera like this but with a lower price\". This is an example of a \"unit critique\" which represents a change request on a single item attribute. \"Compound critiques\" allow the specification of more than one change request at a time. \"Dynamic critiquing\" also takes into account preceding user critiques (the critiquing history). More recent approaches additionally exploit information stored in user interaction logs to further reduce the interaction effort in terms of the number of needed critiquing cycles."], "wikipedia-57680998": ["Section::::Techniques.:SVD++.\nWhile FunkSVD is able to provide very good recommendation quality, its ability to use only explicit numerical ratings as user-items interactions constitutes a limitation. Modern day recommender systems should exploit all available interactions both explicit (e.g. numerical ratings) and implicit (e.g. likes, purchases, skipped, bookmarked). To this end SVD++ was designed to take into account implicit interactions as well.\nCompared to FunkSVD, SVD++ takes also into account user and item bias.\nThe predicted rating user \"u\" will give to item \"i\" is computed as:\nformula_8\nSVD++ has however some disadvantages, with the main drawback being that this method is not \"model-based.\" This means that if a new user is added, the algorithm is incapable of modeling it unless the whole model is retrained. Even though the system might have gathered some interactions for that new user, its latent factors are not available and therefore no recommendations can be computed. This is an example of a cold-start problem, that is the recommender cannot deal efficiently with new users or items and specific strategies should be put in place to handle this disadvantage.\nA possible way to address this cold start problem is to modify SVD++ in order for it to become a \"model-based\" algorithm, therefore allowing to easily manage new items and new users.\nAs previously mentioned in SVD++ we don't have the latent factors of new users, therefore it is necessary to represent them in a different way. The user's latent factors represent the preference of that user for the corresponding item's latent factors, therefore user's latent factors can be estimated via the past user interactions. If the system is able to gather some interactions for the new user it is possible to estimate its latent factors.\nNote that this does not entirely solve the cold-start problem, since the recommender still requires some reliable interactions for new users, but at least there is no need to recompute the whole model every time. It has been demonstrated that this formulation is almost equivalent to a SLIM model, which is an item-item model based recommender.\nformula_9\nWith this formulation, the equivalent item-item recommender would be formula_10. Therefore the similarity matrix is symmetric.\nSection::::Techniques.:Asymmetric SVD.\nAsymmetric SVD aims at combining the advantages of SVD++ while being a model based algorithm, therefore being able to consider new users with a few ratings without needing to retrain the whole model. As opposed to the model-based SVD here the user latent factor matrix H is replaced by Q, which learns the user's preferences as function of their ratings.\nThe predicted rating user \"u\" will give to item \"i\" is computed as:\nformula_11\nWith this formulation, the equivalent item-item recommender would be formula_12. Since matrices Q and W are different the similarity matrix is asymmetric, hence the name of the model.\nSection::::Techniques.:Hybrid MF.\nIn recent years many other matrix factorization models have been developed to exploit the ever increasing amount and variety of available interaction data and use cases. Hybrid matrix factorization algorithms are capable of merging explicit and implicit interactions or both content and collaborative data"], "wikipedia-480289": ["Context-sensitive recommender systems tailor their recommendations to additional information that defines the specific situation under which recommendations are made. This additional information is referred to as the context.\"\nTaking contextual information into consideration, we will have additional dimension to the existing user-item rating matrix. As an instance, assume a music recommender system which provide different recommendations in corresponding to time of the day. In this case, it is possible a user have different preferences for a music in different time of a day. Thus, instead of using user-item matrix, we may use tensor of order 3 (or higher for considering other contexts) to represent context-sensitive users' preferences.\nIn order to take advantage of collaborative filtering and particularly neighborhood-based methods, approaches can be extended from two dimensional rating matrix into tensor of higher order. For this purpose, the approach is to find the most similar/like-minded users to a target user; one can extract and compute similarity of slices (e.g. item-time matrix) corresponding to each user. Unlike context-insensitive case for which similarity of two rating vectors are calculated, in the context-aware approaches, similarity of rating matrices corresponding to each user is calculated by using Pearson coefficients.After the most like-minded users are found, their corresponding ratings are aggregated to identify the set of items to be recommended to the target user.\nThe most important disadvantage of taking context into recommendation model is to be able to deal with larger dataset that contains much more missing values in comparison to user-item rating matrix. Therefore, similar to matrix factorization methods, tensor factorization techniques can be used to reduce dimensionality of original data before using any neighborhood-based methods.\nGenerally, there are two popular auxiliary information: attribute information and interaction information. Attribute information describes a user's or an item's properties. For example, user attribute might include general profile (e.g. gender and age) and social contacts (e.g. followers or friends in social networks); Item attribute means properties like category, brand or content. In addition, interaction information refers to the implicit data showing how users interplay with the item. Widely-used interaction information contains tags, comments or reviews and browsing history etc. Auxiliary information plays a significant role in a variety of aspects. Explicit social links, as a reliable representative of trust or friendship, is always employed in similarity calculation to find similar persons who share interest with the target user.

Much research has been conducted on ongoing privacy issues in this space. The Netflix Prize is particularly notable for the detailed personal information released in its dataset.

In their paper they show that elderly users tend to be more interested in recommendations than younger users.\nBULLET::::- Robustness \u2013 When users can participate in the recommender system, the issue of fraud must be addressed.\nBULLET::::- Serendipity \u2013 Serendipity is a measure of \"how surprising the recommendations are\". For instance, a recommender system that recommends milk to a customer in a grocery store might be perfectly accurate, but it is not a good recommendation because it is an obvious item for the customer to buy.\nBULLET::::- Trust \u2013 A recommender system is of little value for a user if the user does not trust the system. Trust can be built by a recommender system by explaining how it generates recommendations, and why it recommends an item.\nBULLET::::- Labelling \u2013 User satisfaction with recommendations may be influenced by the labeling of the recommendations. For instance, in the cited study click-through rate (CTR) for recommendations labeled as \"Sponsored\" were lower (CTR=5.93%) than CTR for identical recommendations labeled as \"Organic\" (CTR=8.86%). Recommendations with no label performed best (CTR=9.87%) in that study.\nSection::::Performance measures.:Reproducibility in recommender system research.\nPrevious research has had little impact on the practical application of recommender systems. By 2011, Ekstrand, Konstan, et al. criticized that \"it is currently difficult to reproduce and extend recommender systems research results,\u201d and that evaluations are \u201cnot handled consistently\". Konstan and Adomavicius conclude that \"the Recommender Systems research community is facing a crisis where a significant number of papers present results that contribute little to collective knowledge [\u2026] often because the research lacks the [\u2026] evaluation to be properly judged and, hence, to provide meaningful contributions.\" As a consequence, much research about recommender systems can be considered as not reproducible. Hence, operators of recommender systems find little guidance in the current research for answering the question, which recommendation approaches to use in a recommender systems. Said & Bellog\u00edn conducted a study of papers published in the field, as well as benchmarked some of the most popular frameworks for recommendation and found large inconsistencies in results, even when the same algorithms and data sets were used. Some researchers demonstrated that minor variations in the recommendation algorithms or scenarios led to strong changes in the effectiveness of a recommender system. They conclude that seven actions are necessary to improve the current situation: \"(1) survey other research fields and learn from them, (2) find a common understanding of reproducibility, (3) identify and understand the determinants that affect reproducibility, (4) conduct more comprehensive experiments (5) modernize publication practices, (6) foster the development and use of recommendation frameworks, and (7) establish best-practice guidelines for recommender-systems research.\""]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past, or is examining in the present.

A user expresses his or her preferences by rating items (e.g. books, movies or CDs) of the system. These ratings can be viewed as an approximate representation of the user's interest in the corresponding domain.\nBULLET::::2. The system matches this user's ratings against other users' and finds the people with most \"similar\" tastes.\nBULLET::::3. With similar users, the system recommends items that the similar users have rated highly but not yet being rated by this user (presumably the absence of rating is often considered as the unfamiliarity of an item)\nA key problem of collaborative filtering is how to combine and weight the preferences of user neighbors. Sometimes, users can immediately rate the recommended items. As a result, the system gains an increasingly accurate representation of user preferences over time.\nCollaborative filtering systems have many forms, but many common systems can be reduced to two steps:\nBULLET::::1. Look for users who share the same rating patterns with the active user (the user whom the prediction is for).\nBULLET::::2. Use the ratings from those like-minded users found in step 1 to calculate a prediction for the active user\nAlternatively, item-based collaborative filtering (users who bought x also bought y), proceeds in an item-centric manner:\nBULLET::::1. Build an item-item matrix determining relationships between pairs of items\nBULLET::::2. Infer the tastes of the current user by examining the matrix and matching that user's data\nAnother form of collaborative filtering can be based on implicit observations of normal user behavior (as opposed to the artificial behavior imposed by a rating task).

A recommender system aims to predict the preference to an item of a target user. Mainstream recommender systems work on explicit data set. For example, collaborative filtering works on the rating matrix, and content-based filtering works on the meta-data of the items.\n\nIn many social networking services or e-commerce websites, users can provide text review, comment or feedback to the items. These user-generated text provide a rich source of user's sentiment opinions about numerous products and items. Potentially, for an item, such text can reveal both the related feature/aspects of the item and the users' sentiments on each feature. The item's feature/aspects described in the text play the same role with the meta-data in content-based filtering, but the former are more valuable for the recommender system. Since these features are broadly mentioned by users in their reviews, they can be seen as the most crucial features that can significantly influence the user's experience on the item, while the meta-data of the item (usually provided by the producers instead of consumers) may ignore features that are concerned by the users. For different items with common features, a user may give different sentiments. Also, a feature of the same item may receive different sentiments from different users. Users' sentiments on the features can be regarded as a multi-dimensional rating score, reflecting their preference on the items.\n\nBased on the feature/aspects and the sentiments extracted from the user-generated text, a hybrid recommender system can be constructed. There are two types of motivation to recommend a candidate item to a user. The first motivation is the candidate item have numerous common features with the user's preferred items, while the second motivation is that the candidate item receives a high sentiment on its features. For a preferred item, it is reasonable to believe that items with the same features will have a similar function or utility. So, these items will also likely to be preferred by the user. On the other hand, for a shared feature of two candidate items, other users may give positive sentiment to one of them while give negative sentiment to another. Clearly, the high evaluated item should be recommended to the user.

This type of recommendation is quite valuable, especially for those who are traveling to a new city and want the best experience during their trip. Location-based social networks or third-party advertising companies are willing to provide a recommendation not only based on previous check-ins and preferences but also using social links to suggest a not-visited point-of-interest. The implicit goal of this type of recommendation is to lift the user's burden of searching for an interesting place.\nOne of the first studies in this area was conducted in 2011. The idea behind this work was to leverage social influence and location influence and provide recommendations. The authors provide three types of scores:\nBULLET::::- Similar users: this score is proportional to the similarity in behavior of users for visiting places. Mathematically, the similarity score between two users is computed as follows:formula_1Where formula_2 denotes the probability of visiting place formula_3 by user formula_4. This value could be computed based on the idea of user-based collaborative filtering as below:formula_5\nBULLET::::- Similar friends: this score is calculated by the cosine similarity of users based on their mutual connections (i.e.: friendships) in social media. This similarity is proportional to the number of friends that two users have in common. It is calculated as:formula_6Where formula_7represent the set of friends and formula_8is the place set of user formula_4 (i.e.: places the user visited). The tuning parameter formula_10, which is between 0 and 1, controls importance of social similarity and visiting similarity of two users.\nBULLET::::- Geographical distance: This score is inversely proportional to the distance between the target place and the typical places that a user frequently visits. Other studies have shown that overall distribution of distances is similar to power-law distribution.

These systems are applied in scenarios where alternative approaches such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering cannot be applied.\n\nAdditionally, in complex item domains, customers want to specify their preferences explicitly (e.g., \"the maximum price of the car is X\") . In this context, the recommender system must take into account constraints: for instance, only those financial services that support the investment period specified by the customer should be recommended. Neither of these aspects are supported by approaches such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.\n\nIn a search-based recommender, user feedback is given in terms of answers to questions which restrict the set of relevant items. An example of such a question is \"Which type of lens system do you prefer: fixed or exchangeable lenses?\". On the technical level, search-based recommendation scenarios can be implemented on the basis of constraint-based recommender systems. Constraint-based recommender systems are implemented on the basis of constraint search or different types of conjunctive query-based approaches.\n\nIn a navigation-based recommender, user feedback is typically provided in terms of \"critiques\" which specify change requests regarding the item currently recommended to the user. Critiques are then used for the recommendation of the next \"candidate\" item. An example of a critique in the context of a digital camera recommendation scenario is \"I would like to have a camera like this but with a lower price\". This is an example of a \"unit critique\" which represents a change request on a single item attribute. \"Compound critiques\" allow the specification of more than one change request at a time. \"Dynamic critiquing\" also takes into account preceding user critiques (the critiquing history). More recent approaches additionally exploit information stored in user interaction logs to further reduce the interaction effort in terms of the number of needed critiquing cycles."], "wikipedia-480289": ["Typically, the workflow of a collaborative filtering system is:\nBULLET::::1. A user expresses his or her preferences by rating items (e.g. books, movies or CDs) of the system. These ratings can be viewed as an approximate representation of the user's interest in the corresponding domain.\nBULLET::::2. The system matches this user's ratings against other users' and finds the people with most \"similar\" tastes.\nBULLET::::3. With similar users, the system recommends items that the similar users have rated highly but not yet being rated by this user (presumably the absence of rating is often considered as the unfamiliarity of an item)\nA key problem of collaborative filtering is how to combine and weight the preferences of user neighbors. Sometimes, users can immediately rate the recommended items. As a result, the system gains an increasingly accurate representation of user preferences over time.\n\nAlternatively, item-based collaborative filtering (users who bought x also bought y), proceeds in an item-centric manner:\nBULLET::::1. Build an item-item matrix determining relationships between pairs of items\nBULLET::::2. Infer the tastes of the current user by examining the matrix and matching that user's data\n\nAnother form of collaborative filtering can be based on implicit observations of normal user behavior (as opposed to the artificial behavior imposed by a rating task). These systems observe what a user has done together with what all users have done (what music they have listened to, what items they have bought) and use that data to predict the user's behavior in the future, or to predict how a user might like to behave given the chance. These predictions then have to be filtered through business logic to determine how they might affect the actions of a business system. For example, it is not useful to offer to sell somebody a particular album of music if they already have demonstrated that they own that music."], "wikipedia-6435232": ["For a recommender system, sentiment analysis has been proven to be a valuable technique. A recommender system aims to predict the preference to an item of a target user. Mainstream recommender systems work on explicit data set. For example, collaborative filtering works on the rating matrix, and content-based filtering works on the meta-data of the items.\nIn many social networking services or e-commerce websites, users can provide text review, comment or feedback to the items. These user-generated text provide a rich source of user's sentiment opinions about numerous products and items. Potentially, for an item, such text can reveal both the related feature/aspects of the item and the users' sentiments on each feature. The item's feature/aspects described in the text play the same role with the meta-data in content-based filtering, but the former are more valuable for the recommender system. Since these features are broadly mentioned by users in their reviews, they can be seen as the most crucial features that can significantly influence the user's experience on the item, while the meta-data of the item (usually provided by the producers instead of consumers) may ignore features that are concerned by the users. For different items with common features, a user may give different sentiments. Also, a feature of the same item may receive different sentiments from different users. Users' sentiments on the features can be regarded as a multi-dimensional rating score, reflecting their preference on the items.\nBased on the feature/aspects and the sentiments extracted from the user-generated text, a hybrid recommender system can be constructed. There are two types of motivation to recommend a candidate item to a user. The first motivation is the candidate item have numerous common features with the user's preferred items, while the second motivation is that the candidate item receives a high sentiment on its features. For a preferred item, it is reasonable to believe that items with the same features will have a similar function or utility. So, these items will also likely to be preferred by the user. On the other hand, for a shared feature of two candidate items, other users may give positive sentiment to one of them while give negative sentiment to another. Clearly, the high evaluated item should be recommended to the user. Based on these two motivations, a combination ranking score of similarity and sentiment rating can be constructed for each candidate item."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

Content-based filtering approaches utilize a series of discrete, pre-tagged characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties.

The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items. By locating peer users/items with a rating history similar to the current user or item, they generate recommendations using this neighborhood. The user- and item-based nearest neighbor algorithms can be combined to deal with the cold start problem and improve recommendation results using this data. Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory-based and model-based. A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an \"understanding\" of the item itself.\n\nContent-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user\u2019s preferences. These methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item (name, location, description, etc.), but not on the user. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on product features. In this system, keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes.

There are several reasons for this. Users may ignore items when they are shown for the first time, for instance, because they had no time to inspect the recommendations carefully.\n- Privacy \u2013 Recommender systems usually have to deal with privacy concerns because users have to reveal sensitive information. Building user profiles using collaborative filtering can be problematic from a privacy point of view. Many European countries have a strong culture of data privacy, and every attempt to introduce any level of user profiling can result in a negative customer response. Much research has been conducted on ongoing privacy issues in this space. The Netflix Prize is particularly notable for the detailed personal information released in its dataset. Ramakrishnan et al. have conducted an extensive overview of the trade-offs between personalization and privacy and found that the combination of weak ties (an unexpected connection that provides serendipitous recommendations) and other data sources can be used to uncover identities of users in an anonymized dataset.\n- User demographics \u2013 Beel et al. found that user demographics may influence how satisfied users are with recommendations. In their paper they show that elderly users tend to be more interested in recommendations than younger users.\n- Robustness \u2013 When users can participate in the recommender system, the issue of fraud must be addressed.\n- Serendipity \u2013 Serendipity is a measure of \"how surprising the recommendations are\". For instance, a recommender system that recommends milk to a customer in a grocery store might be perfectly accurate, but it is not a good recommendation because it is an obvious item for the customer to buy.\n- Trust \u2013 A recommender system is of little value for a user if the user does not trust the system. Trust can be built by a recommender system by explaining how it generates recommendations, and why it recommends an item.\n- Labelling \u2013 User satisfaction with recommendations may be influenced by the labeling of the recommendations. For instance, in the cited study click-through rate (CTR) for recommendations labeled as \"Sponsored\" were lower (CTR=5.93%) than CTR for identical recommendations labeled as \"Organic\" (CTR=8.86%).

S. Boas in \"Shakespeare and his Predecessors\" (1896), derived from a type of drama that was popular at the time of Boas' writing. It was most associated with the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. In these problem plays, the situation faced by the protagonist is put forward by the author as a representative instance of a contemporary social problem. The term can refer to the subject matter of the play, or to a classification \"problem\" with the plays themselves. \n\nSome critics include other plays, most commonly \"The Winter's Tale\", \"Timon of Athens\", and \"The Merchant of Venice\". The term has been variously applied to other odd plays from different points in Shakespeare's career, as the notion of a problem-play has always been somewhat vaguely defined and is not accepted by all critics.\n\nAccording to Boas, Shakespeare's problem-plays set out to explore specific moral dilemmas and social problems through their central characters.\n\nBoas contends that the plays allow the reader to analyze complex and neglected topics. Rather than arousing simple joy or pain, the plays induce engrossment and bewilderment. \"All's Well that Ends Well\" and \"Measure for Measure\" have resolutions, but \"Troilus and Cressida\" and \"Hamlet\" do not. Instead Shakespeare requires that the reader decipher the plays. Per Boas, these plays, distinguished by their themes and treatment, require classification beyond comedy; adopting the popular classification of his time, he called them problem plays.\n\nAuthor Neil Rhodes argues that the defining characteristic of the Shakespearean problem-play is its controversial plot, and as such, the subgenre of problem-plays has become less distinct as scholars continue to debate the controversies in Shakespeare's straightforward tragedies and comedies. What differentiates plays like \"Measure for Measure\" from Shakespeare's explicitly comedic or tragic plays is that it presents both sides of a contentious issue without making a judgement for the audience.\n\nAnother scholarly analysis of Shakespeare's problem-plays by A.G. Harmon argues that what the problem-plays have in common is how each consciously debates the relationship between law and nature. Many of the problem-plays address a disorder in nature, and the characters attempt to mitigate the disorder in varying manners. In four of the plays that Harmon categorizes as problem-plays, \"The Merchant of Venice,\" \"All's Well That Ends Well,\" \"Measure for Measure,\" and \"Troilus and Cressida,\" the social order is restored when faulty contracts are properly amended. Harmon's conception of the problem-plays differs from others in that he argues that the problem-plays offer a resolution to their respective stories. Much like the characters in the plays must fulfill their contracts, he argues, Shakespeare fulfills his contract as a playwright by providing resolution. Though Harmon's conception of the problem-plays does not align with the common understanding of Shakespeare's problem-plays, he does provide examples of the social dilemmas that Shakespeare addresses through these plays. The common social problem, per Harmon, is the tension between laws establishing order and the natural tendencies of humans. The problem-plays follow a formula: the established laws of society are challenged, chaos reigns over society, chaos is vanquished by the institution of a new order.\n\nFrom the perspective of scholar Ernest Schanzer, a Shakespearean problem-play is first defined independently of the idea of a Shakespearean play and only by what the phrase \"problem play\" itself necessitates. Schanzer chooses to consider only ethical dilemmas in the definition of \"problem,\" excluding psychological, political, social, and metaphysical problems that may develop. He concludes that problem plays are classified by a pivotal ethical dilemma that instigates multiple opposing but equally plausible opinions from the audience."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Adaptive changes in a system that learns users' preferences and needs only by interpreting their behavior might appear a bit opaque to the users, because they cannot fully understand and reconstruct why the system behaves the way it does. Moreover, the system is forced to collect a certain amount of data before it is able to predict the users' needs with the required accuracy. Therefore, it takes a certain learning time before a user can benefit from adaptive changes. However, afterwards these automatically adjusted user models allow a quite accurate adaptivity of the system. The hybrid approach tries to combine the advantages of both methods. Through collecting data by directly asking its users it gathers a first stock of information which can be used for adaptive changes.

The idea behind this work was to leverage social influence and location influence and provide recommendations. The authors provide three types of scores:\nBULLET::::- Similar users: this score is proportional to the similarity in behavior of users for visiting places.

The formula below calculates the probability of check-in for user formula_4 in place formula_3 according to its distance from all check-ins of user formula_4.formula_14\nThe aggregate of these three scores is defined as:formula_15Where the three terms correspond to recommender systems based on user preference, social influence and geographical influence, respectively.

The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person \"A\" has the same opinion as a person \"B\" on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person. For example, a collaborative filtering recommendation system for television tastes could make predictions about which television show a user should like given a partial list of that user's tastes (likes or dislikes). Note that these predictions are specific to the user, but use information gleaned from many users. This differs from the simpler approach of giving an average (non-specific) score for each item of interest, for example based on its number of votes.\n\nTypically, the workflow of a collaborative filtering system is:\nBULLET::::1.

These systems are applied in scenarios where alternative approaches such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering cannot be applied.\n\nAdditionally, in complex item domains, customers want to specify their preferences explicitly (e.g., \"the maximum price of the car is X\") . In this context, the recommender system must take into account constraints: for instance, only those financial services that support the investment period specified by the customer should be recommended. Neither of these aspects are supported by approaches such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.\n\nKnowledge-based recommender systems are often conversational, i.e., user requirements and preferences are elicited within the scope of a feedback loop. A major reason for the conversational nature of knowledge-based recommender systems is the complexity of the item domain where it is often impossible to articulate all user preferences at once. Furthermore, user preferences are typically not known exactly at the beginning but are constructed within the scope of a recommendation session.\n\nIn a search-based recommender, user feedback is given in terms of answers to questions which restrict the set of relevant items. An example of such a question is \"Which type of lens system do you prefer: fixed or exchangeable lenses?\". On the technical level, search-based recommendation scenarios can be implemented on the basis of constraint-based recommender systems. Constraint-based recommender systems are implemented on the basis of constraint search or different types of conjunctive query-based approaches.\n\nIn a navigation-based recommender, user feedback is typically provided in terms of \"critiques\" which specify change requests regarding the item currently recommended to the user. Critiques are then used for the recommendation of the next \"candidate\" item. An example of a critique in the context of a digital camera recommendation scenario is \"I would like to have a camera like this but with a lower price\". This is an example of a \"unit critique\" which represents a change request on a single item attribute. \"Compound critiques\" allow the specification of more than one change request at a time. \"Dynamic critiquing\" also takes into account preceding user critiques (the critiquing history).

It is commonly accepted that mathematics is a difficult area of study. Even so, it is generally agreed that the difficulty experienced when one attempts to master a topic leads to meaningful, long lasting, rewards. There is a long list of mathematics competitions throughout the world.\nSection::::Professional context.\nThere are a number of problems in pure mathematics with a cash prize offered for a successful solution. Often the problems are thought of as relevant areas of study in modern mathematical research. One example of such a mathematical challenge is the Riemann hypothesis which is currently an unsolved problem. The Riemann hypothesis is that all nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have a real part of . A proof or disproof of this would have far-reaching implications in number theory, especially for the distribution of prime numbers.\nThere are several professional organizations that collect various unsolved math problems and present them as mathematical challenges. Some collections are the:\nBULLET::::- Millennium Prize Problems\nBULLET::::- Certicom ECC Challenge\nBULLET::::- RSA Factoring Challenge (no longer active)\nMathematical Challenge can also refer to:\nBULLET::::- United Kingdom Mathematical Challenges"], "wikipedia-7324529": ["According to the OIF, the top three reasons for challenging such materials were that they contained \"sexually explicit\" content, \"offensive\" language, or were \"unsuited to age group\"."], "wikipedia-2296589": ["Grand Challenges are difficult but important problems set by various institutions or professions to encourage solutions or advocate for the application of government or philanthropic funds especially in the most highly developed economies and \nGrand challenges are more than ordinary research questions or priorities, they are end results or outcomes that are global in scale; very difficult to accomplish, yet offer hope of being ultimately tractable; demand an extensive number of research projects across many technical and non-technical disciplines and accompanied by well-defined metrics. Lastly, Grand challenges must capture \"the popular imagination, and thus political support.\""], "wikipedia-412627": ["The simplest example of a challenge\u2013response protocol is password authentication, where the challenge is asking for the password and the valid response is the correct password.\nClearly an adversary who can eavesdrop on a password authentication can then authenticate itself in the same way. One solution is to issue multiple passwords, each of them marked with an identifier. The verifier can ask for any of the passwords, and the prover must have that correct password for that identifier. Assuming that the passwords are chosen independently, an adversary who intercepts one challenge\u2013response message pair has no clues to help with a different challenge at a different time.\nFor example, when other communications security methods are unavailable, the U.S. military uses the AKAC-1553 TRIAD numeral cipher to authenticate and encrypt some communications. TRIAD includes a list of three-letter challenge codes, which the verifier is supposed to choose randomly from, and random three-letter responses to them. For added security, each set of codes is only valid for a particular time period which is ordinarily 24 hours.\nA more interesting challenge\u2013response technique works as follows. Say, Bob is controlling access to some resource. Alice comes along seeking entry. Bob issues a challenge, perhaps \"52w72y\". Alice must respond with the one string of characters which \"fits\" the challenge Bob issued. The \"fit\" is determined by an algorithm \"known\" to Bob and Alice. (The correct response might be as simple as \"63x83z\" (each character of response one more than that of challenge), but in the real world, the \"rules\" would be much more complex.) Bob issues a different challenge each time, and thus knowing a previous correct response (even if it isn't \"hidden\" by the means of communication used between Alice and Bob) is of no use.\nSection::::Other non-cryptographic protocols.\nChallenge-response protocols are also used to assert things other than knowledge of a secret value. CAPTCHAs, for example, are a sort of variant on the Turing test, meant to determine whether a viewer of a Web application is a real person. The challenge sent to the viewer is a distorted image of some text, and the viewer responds by typing in that text. The distortion is designed to make automated optical character recognition (OCR) difficult and preventing a computer program from passing as a human.\nSection::::Cryptographic techniques.\nNon-cryptographic authentication were generally adequate in the days before the Internet, when the user could be sure that the system asking for the password was really the system they were trying to access, and that nobody was likely to be eavesdropping on the communication channel to observe the password being entered. To address the insecure channel problem, a more sophisticated approach is necessary. Many cryptographic solutions involve \"two-way authentication\", where both the user and the system must each convince the other that they know the shared secret (the password), without this secret ever being transmitted in the clear over the communication channel, where eavesdroppers might be lurking.\nOne way this is done involves using the password as the encryption key to transmit some randomly generated information as the \"challenge\", whereupon the other end must return as its \"response\" a similarly encrypted value which is some predetermined function of the originally offered information, thus proving that it was able to decrypt the challenge. For instance, in Kerberos, the challenge is an encrypted integer \"N\", while the response is the encrypted integer \"N + 1\", proving that the other end was able to decrypt the integer \"N\". In other variations, a hash function operates on a password and a random challenge value to create a response value.\nSuch encrypted or hashed exchanges do not directly reveal the password to an eavesdropper. However, they may supply enough information to allow an eavesdropper to deduce what the password is, using a dictionary attack or brute-force attack. The use of information which is randomly generated on each exchange (and where the response is different from the challenge) guards against the possibility of a replay attack, where a malicious intermediary simply records the exchanged data and retransmits it at a later time to fool one end into thinking it has authenticated a new connection attempt from the other.\nAuthentication protocols usually employ a cryptographic nonce as the challenge to ensure that every challenge-response sequence is unique. This protects against a man-in-the-middle attack and subsequent replay attack. If it is impractical to implement a true nonce, a strong cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator and cryptographic hash function can generate challenges that are highly unlikely to occur more than once. It is sometimes important not to use time-based nonces, as these can weaken servers in different time zones and servers with inaccurate clocks. It can also be important to use time-based nonces and synchronized clocks if the application is vulnerable to a delayed message attack. This attack occurs where an attacker copies a transmission whilst blocking it from reaching the destination, allowing them to replay the captured transmission after a delay of their choosing. This is easily accomplished on wireless channels. The time-based nonce can be used to limit the attacker to resending the message but restricted by an expiry time of perhaps less than one second, likely having no effect upon the application and so mitigating the attack.\nMutual authentication is performed using a challenge-response handshake in both directions; the server ensures that the client knows the secret, and the client \"also\" ensures that the server knows the secret, which protects against a rogue server impersonating the real server.\nChallenge\u2013response authentication can help solve the problem of exchanging session keys for encryption. Using a key derivation function, the challenge value and the secret may be combined to generate an unpredictable encryption key for the session. This is particularly effective against a man-in-the-middle attack, because the attacker will not be able to derive the session key from the challenge without knowing the secret, and therefore will not be able to decrypt the data stream."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

While the exact implementation depends on the context, general methodologies (e.g., inverse reinforcement learning, metric aggregation) are covered in arXiv papers unrelated to any single original study."}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-33918377": 1, "wikipedia-6093953": 1, "wikipedia-6226648": 1, "wikipedia-29353190": 1, "wikipedia-473324": 1, "wikipedia-232495": 1, "wikipedia-169407": 1, "wikipedia-15409391": 1, "wikipedia-39733154": 1, "wikipedia-10145037": 1, "arxiv-1708.04378": 1, "arxiv-2410.13108": 1, "arxiv-2209.15166": 1, "arxiv-2101.05004": 1, "arxiv-2308.13937": 1, "arxiv-2404.01863": 1, "arxiv-2006.04520": 1, "arxiv-2303.06135": 1, "arxiv-2406.06043": 1, "arxiv-2408.09601": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-33918377": 1, "wikipedia-6093953": 1, "wikipedia-6226648": 1, "wikipedia-29353190": 1, "wikipedia-473324": 1, "wikipedia-232495": 1, "wikipedia-169407": 1, "wikipedia-15409391": 1, "wikipedia-39733154": 1, "wikipedia-10145037": 1, "arxiv-1708.04378": 1, "arxiv-2410.13108": 1, "arxiv-2209.15166": 1, "arxiv-2101.05004": 1, "arxiv-2308.13937": 1, "arxiv-2404.01863": 1, "arxiv-2006.04520": 1, "arxiv-2303.06135": 1, "arxiv-2406.06043": 1, "arxiv-2408.09601": 1}}}

In artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science, \"the action selection problem\" is typically associated with intelligent agents and animats\u2014artificial systems that exhibit complex behaviour in an agent environment. One fundamental question about action selection is whether it is really a problem at all for an agent, or whether it is just a description of an emergent property of an intelligent agent's behavior. However, if we consider how we are going to build an intelligent agent, then it becomes apparent there must be \"some\" mechanism for action selection. This mechanism may be highly distributed (as in the case of distributed organisms such as social insect colonies or slime mold) or it may be a special-purpose module. The action selection mechanism (ASM) determines not only the agent\u2019s actions in terms of impact on the world, but also directs its perceptual attention, and updates its memory. Generally, artificial action selection mechanisms can be divided into several categories: symbol-based systems sometimes known as classical planning, distributed solutions, and reactive or dynamic planning. Early in the history of artificial intelligence, it was assumed that the best way for an agent to choose what to do next would be to compute a probably optimal plan, and then execute that plan. Goal driven architectures \u2013 In these symbolic architectures, the agent's behaviour is typically described by a set of goals. Each goal can be achieved by a process or an activity, which is described by a prescripted plan. The agent must just decide which process to carry on to accomplish a given goal. In contrast to the symbolic approach, distributed systems of action selection actually have no one \"box\" in the agent which decides the next action. Dynamic or reactive planning methods compute just one next action in every instant based on the current context and pre-scripted plans."], "wikipedia-47893974": ["In artificial intelligence, a behavior selection algorithm, or action selection algorithm, is an algorithm that selects appropriate behaviors or actions for one or more intelligent agents.

It does this by adding the maximum reward attainable from future states to the reward for achieving its current state, effectively influencing the current action by the potential future reward. This potential reward is a weighted sum of the expected values of the rewards of all future steps starting from the current state. \n\nAs an example, consider the process of boarding a train, in which the reward is measured by the negative of the total time spent boarding (alternatively, the cost of boarding the train is equal to the boarding time). One strategy is to enter the train door as soon as they open, minimizing the initial wait time for yourself. If the train is crowded, however, then you will have a slow entry after the initial action of entering the door as people are fighting you to depart the train as you attempt to board. The total boarding time, or cost, is then:\nBULLET::::- 0 seconds wait time + 15 seconds fight time\nOn the next day, by random chance (exploration), you decide to wait and let other people depart first. This initially results in a longer wait time. However, time fighting other passengers is less. Overall, this path has a higher reward than that of the previous day, since the total boarding time is now: \nBULLET::::- 5 second wait time + 0 second fight time.\nThrough exploration, despite the initial (patient) action resulting in a larger cost (or negative reward) than in the forceful strategy, the overall cost is lower, thus revealing a more rewarding strategy.\n\nThe algorithm, therefore, has a function that calculates the quality of a state-action combination:\nBefore learning begins, is initialized to a possibly arbitrary fixed value (chosen by the programmer). Then, at each time formula_9 the agent selects an action formula_10, observes a reward formula_11, enters a new state formula_12 (that may depend on both the previous state formula_13 and the selected action), and formula_14 is updated. The core of the algorithm is a simple value iteration update, using the weighted average of the old value and the new information:\nwhere \"formula_16\" is the reward received when moving from the state formula_17 to the state formula_12, and formula_19 is the learning rate (formula_20)."], "wikipedia-66294": ["A reinforcement learning agent interacts with its environment in discrete time steps. At each time , the agent receives an observation formula_9, which typically includes the reward formula_10. It then chooses an action formula_11 from the set of available actions, which is subsequently sent to the environment. The environment moves to a new state formula_12 and the reward formula_13 associated with the \"transition\" formula_14 is determined. The goal of a reinforcement learning agent is to collect as much reward as possible. The agent can (possibly randomly) choose any action as a function of the history.\nWhen the agent's performance is compared to that of an agent that acts optimally, the difference in performance gives rise to the notion of \"regret\". In order to act near optimally, the agent must reason about the long term consequences of its actions (i.e., maximize future income), although the immediate reward associated with this might be negative.\nThus, reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited to problems that include a long-term versus short-term reward trade-off. It has been applied successfully to various problems, including robot control, elevator scheduling, telecommunications, backgammon, checkers and go (AlphaGo).\nTwo elements make reinforcement learning powerful: the use of samples to optimize performance and the use of function approximation to deal with large environments. Thanks to these two key components, reinforcement learning can be used in large environments in the following situations:\nBULLET::::- A model of the environment is known, but an analytic solution is not available;\nBULLET::::- Only a simulation model of the environment is given (the subject of simulation-based optimization);\nBULLET::::- The only way to collect information about the environment is to interact with it.\nThe first two of these problems could be considered planning problems (since some form of model is available), while the last one could be considered to be a genuine learning problem.

Many software agents still use this approach for action selection.

Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from a user's past behavior (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in. Content-based filtering approaches utilize a series of discrete, pre-tagged characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties. Current recommender systems typically combine one or more approaches into a hybrid system.\n\nExamples of explicit data collection include the following:\nBULLET::::- Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.\nBULLET::::- Asking a user to search.\nBULLET::::- Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.\nBULLET::::- Presenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the better one of them.\nBULLET::::- Asking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes (see \"Rocchio classification\" or other similar techniques).\nExamples of implicit data collection include the following:\nBULLET::::- Observing the items that a user views in an online store.\nBULLET::::- Analyzing item/user viewing times.\nBULLET::::- Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online.\nBULLET::::- Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his/her computer.\nBULLET::::- Analyzing the user's social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes.\n\nAnother common approach when designing recommender systems is content-based filtering. Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user\u2019s preferences. These methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item (name, location, description, etc.), but not on the user. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on product features.\nIn this system, keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past, or is examining in the present. It does not rely on a user sign-in mechanism to generate this often temporary profile. In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended. This approach has its roots in information retrieval and information filtering research.\nTo create a user profile, the system mostly focuses on two types of information:\n1. A model of the user's preference.\n2. A history of the user's interaction with the recommender system."], "wikipedia-28010520": ["Research systems that personalize search results model their users in different ways. Some rely on users explicitly specifying their interests or on demographic/cognitive characteristics. However, user-supplied information can be difficult to collect and keep up to date. Others have built implicit user models based on content the user has read or their history of interaction with Web pages.\n\nOne technique Google uses to personalize searches for its users is to track log in time and if the user has enabled web history in his browser. If a user accesses the same site through a search result from Google many times, it believes that they like that page. So when users carry out certain searches, Google's personalized search algorithm gives the page a boost, moving it up through the ranks. Even if a user is signed out, Google may personalize their results because it keeps a 180-day record of what a particular web browser has searched for, linked to a cookie in that browser.\n\nIn search engines on social networking platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn, personalization could be achieved by exploiting homophily between searchers and results. For example, in People search, searchers are often interested in people in the same social circles, industries or companies. In Job search, searchers are usually interested in jobs at similar companies, jobs at nearby locations and jobs requiring expertise similar to their own.\n\nOne concept-strategy the researchers came up with to improve personalized search and yield both positive and negative preferences is the click-based method.

In a discrete system, the state space is countable and often finite, and the system's internal behaviour or interaction with its environment consists of separately occurring individual actions or events, such as accepting input or producing output, that may or may not cause the system to change its state. Examples of such systems are digital logic circuits and components, automata and formal language, computer programs, and computers. The output of a digital circuit or computer program at any time is completely determined by its current inputs and its state.\n\nSimilarly, a computer program stores data in variables, which represent storage locations in the computer's memory. The contents of these memory locations, at any given point in the program's execution, is called the program's \"state\".\n\nA more specialized definition of state is used for computer programs that operate serially or sequentially on streams of data, such as parsers, firewalls, communication protocols and encryption. Serial programs operate on the incoming data characters or packets sequentially, one at a time. In some of these programs, information about previous data characters or packets received is stored in variables and used to affect the processing of the current character or packet. This is called a \"stateful protocol\" and the data carried over from the previous processing cycle is called the \"state\". In others, the program has no information about the previous data stream and starts \"fresh\" with each data input; this is called a \"stateless protocol\"."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

These pages detail common techniques like matrix factorization, collaborative filtering, and hybrid approaches that leverage both feedback types.", "wikipedia-5818361": ["Relevance feedback is a feature of some information retrieval systems. The idea behind relevance feedback is to take the results that are initially returned from a given query, to gather user feedback, and to use information about whether or not those results are relevant to perform a new query. We can usefully distinguish between three types of feedback: explicit feedback, implicit feedback, and blind or \"pseudo\" feedback.\n\nSection::::Explicit feedback.\nExplicit feedback is obtained from assessors of relevance indicating the relevance of a document retrieved for a query. This type of feedback is defined as explicit only when the assessors (or other users of a system) know that the feedback provided is interpreted as relevance judgments.\nUsers may indicate relevance explicitly using a \"binary\" or \"graded\" relevance system. Binary relevance feedback indicates that a document is either relevant or irrelevant for a given query. Graded relevance feedback indicates the relevance of a document to a query on a scale using numbers, letters, or descriptions (such as \"not relevant\", \"somewhat relevant\", \"relevant\", or \"very relevant\"). Graded relevance may also take the form of a cardinal ordering of documents created by an assessor; that is, the assessor places documents of a result set in order of (usually descending) relevance. An example of this would be the SearchWiki feature implemented by Google on their search website.\nThe relevance feedback information needs to be interpolated with the original query to improve retrieval performance, such as the well-known Rocchio algorithm.\nA performance metric which became popular around 2005 to measure the usefulness of a ranking algorithm based on the explicit relevance feedback is NDCG. Other measures include precision at \"k\" and mean average precision.\n\nSection::::Implicit feedback.\nImplicit feedback is inferred from user behavior, such as noting which documents they do and do not select for viewing, the duration of time spent viewing a document, or page browsing or scrolling actions . There are many signals during the search process that one can use for implicit feedback and the types of information to provide in response\nThe key differences of implicit relevance feedback from that of explicit include :\nBULLET::::1. the user is not assessing relevance for the benefit of the IR system, but only satisfying their own needs and\nBULLET::::2. the user is not necessarily informed that their behavior (selected documents) will be used as relevance feedback\nAn example of this is dwell time, which is a measure of how long a user spends viewing the page linked to in a search result. It is an indicator of how well the search result met the query intent of the user, and is used as a feedback mechanism to improve search results.\nAnother example of this is the Surf Canyon browser extension, which advances search results from later pages of the result set based on both user interaction (clicking an icon) and time spent viewing the page linked to in a search result.\n\nSection::::Using relevance information.\nRelevance information is utilized by using the contents of the relevant documents to either adjust the weights of terms in the original query, or by using those contents to add words to the query. Relevance feedback is often implemented using the Rocchio algorithm."], "wikipedia-19017539": ["The collection of user-related data in human\u2013computer interaction is used to adapt the computer interface to the end user. The data collected are used to build a user model. The user model is then used to help the application to filter the information for the end user. Such systems are useful in recommender applications, military applications (implicit stress detection) and others.\n\nThe system can record the user's explicit interaction and thus build an MPEG7 usage history log. Furthermore, the system can use other channels to gather information about the user's emotional state. The following implicit channels have been used so far to get the affective state of the end user:\nBULLET::::- facial activity\nBULLET::::- posture activity\nBULLET::::- hand tension and activity\nBULLET::::- gestural activity\nBULLET::::- vocal expression\nBULLET::::- language and choice of words\nBULLET::::- electrodermal activity\nBULLET::::- eye tracking"], "wikipedia-596646": ["When building a model from a user's behavior, a distinction is often made between explicit and implicit forms of data collection.\nExamples of explicit data collection include the following:\nBULLET::::- Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.\nBULLET::::- Asking a user to search.\nBULLET::::- Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.\nBULLET::::- Presenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the better one of them.\nBULLET::::- Asking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes (see \"Rocchio classification\" or other similar techniques).\nExamples of implicit data collection include the following:\nBULLET::::- Observing the items that a user views in an online store.\nBULLET::::- Analyzing item/user viewing times.\nBULLET::::- Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online.\nBULLET::::- Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his/her computer.\nBULLET::::- Analyzing the user's social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This approach unifies the organization around a brand and mission that continually seeks to find better ways to help the end-user customer, enhance the relationship with channel partners, suppliers, and employees and ultimately create new opportunities for the business, rather than simply finding ways to improve processes.

For example, the negative emotion of anxiety leads to the specific fight-or-flight response for immediate survival. On the other hand, positive emotions do not have any immediate survival value, because they take one's mind off immediate needs and stressors.

This is why there can be an infinitude of solutions to the ordinary least squares problem when formula_127. However, when formula_130, i.e., when ridge regression is used, the addition of formula_124 to the sample covariance matrix ensures that all of its eigenvalues will be strictly greater than 0. In other words, it becomes invertible, and the solution becomes unique.\nCompared to ordinary least squares, ridge regression is not unbiased. It accepts little bias to reduce variance and the mean square error, and helps to improve the prediction accuracy. Thus, ridge estimator yields more stable solutions by shrinking coefficients but suffers from the lack of sensitivity to the data.\nSection::::Specific examples.:Lasso regression.\nThe least absolute selection and shrinkage (LASSO) method is another popular choice. In lasso regression, the lasso penalty function formula_118 is the formula_133 norm, i.e.\nNote that the lasso penalty function is convex but not strictly convex. \nUnlike Tikhonov regularization, this scheme does not have a convenient closed-form solution: instead, the solution is typically found using quadratic programming or more general convex optimization methods, as well as by specific algorithms such as the least-angle regression algorithm.\nAn important difference between lasso regression and Tikhonov regularization is that lasso regression forces more entries of formula_55 to actually equal 0 than would otherwise. In contrast, while Tikhonov regularization forces entries of formula_55 to be small, it does not force more of them to be 0 than would be otherwise. Thus, LASSO regularization is more appropriate than Tikhonov regularization in cases in which we expect the number of non-zero entries of formula_55 to be small, and Tikhonov regularization is more appropriate when we expect that entries of formula_55 will generally be small but not necessarily zero. Which of these regimes is more relevant depends on the specific data set at hand.\nBesides feature selection described above, LASSO has some limitations. Ridge regression provides better accuracy in the case formula_140 for highly correlated variables. In another case, formula_141, LASSO selects at most formula_142 variables. Moreover, LASSO tends to select some arbitrary variables from group of highly correlated samples, so there is no grouping effect.\nSection::::Specific examples.:\"\u2113\" Penalization.\nThe most extreme way to enforce sparsity is to say that the actual magnitude of the coefficients of formula_55 does not matter; rather, the only thing that determines the complexity of formula_55 is the number of non-zero entries. This corresponds to setting formula_146 to be the formula_147 norm of formula_55. This regularization function, while attractive for the sparsity that it guarantees, is very difficult to solve because doing so requires optimization of a function that is not even weakly convex. Lasso regression is the minimal possible relaxation of formula_147 penalization that yields a weakly convex optimization problem.\nSection::::Specific examples.:Elastic net.\nFor any non-negative formula_150 and formula_151 the objective has the following form:\nLet formula_153, then the solution of the minimization problem is described as:\nConsider formula_156 as an Elastic Net penalty function.\nWhen formula_157, elastic net becomes ridge regression, whereas formula_158 it becomes Lasso. formula_159 Elastic Net penalty function doesn't have the first derivative at 0 and it is strictly convex \nformula_160 taking the properties both lasso regression and ridge regression.\nOne of the main properties of the Elastic Net is that it can select groups of correlated variables. The difference between weight vectors of samples formula_161 and formula_162 is given by:\nIf formula_161 and formula_162 are highly correlated ( formula_167), the weight vectors are very close. In the case of negatively correlated samples ( formula_168) the samples formula_169 can be taken.

The 2D LMS Adaptive filters are derived from the 1D LMS adaptvie filters main method which minimizes the output mean square value by adjusting coefficients of the filter. The filter has the primary 2D input signal d and the reference input signal x. The primary input signal d consists of the ideal signal and noise component. The filter is an N by N causal FIR filter with impulse response formula_14. Then we can get the filter output given by\nformula_15\nwhere j is the iteration number for adaptive filters.\nThe error signal formula_16 at the j-th iteration is defined as\nformula_17\nThe weight matrix at the next iteration is equal to the present weight matrix plus a change proportional to the negative gradient of the mean square error. For the two-dimensional LMS adaptive filter, the filter coefficients are updated as follows:\nformula_18\nwhere formula_19 is the scaler multiplier controlling which can control the rate of convergence and filter stability.\nAdvantages: The TDLMS adaptive filter can be implemented without any form of matrix operations or any averaging or differentiation. The algorithm convergence does not depend on the initial conditions and it will converge for any arbitrarily initial value, hence, it provides good performance in nonstationary images.\nDisadvantages: The exact values of the expectations of the TDLMS adaptive filter will not converges to a fixed value, if we need to maintain its tracking ability. Therefore, the design choice of \u03bc depends on the particular application and it involves a tradeoff between the convergence speed, tracking ability, and steady-state MSE.\nSection::::Approaches.:2D Least Mean Square IIR Adaptive Filters.\nFor a two-dimensional LMS IIR Adaptive filter, its basic idea is the same as 2D LMS FIR Adaptive Filters, except we are using an IIR filter, which can reduce the filter order requirements. The two-dimensional IIR filter`s difference equation can be written as\nformula_20\nwhere formula_5 and formula_22 are, respectively, the output and input of the adaptive filter. formula_23 and formula_24 are the masks of the filter`s input and output. The error signal is given by\nformula_25\nwhere formula_4is the primary output signal.\nThe mean square error formula_27 is minimized by updating the filter weights in a manner to converge to the optimum filter weight.\nAdvantages: IIR filters can satisfy the prescribed frequency response because it can reduce the filter`s order requirements.\nDisadvantages: The performance surfaces of adaptive LMS IIR Adaptive filters are nonquadratic and may have local minima. Meanwhile, adaptive IIR filters may become unstable during the adaptation, thus some kind of stability monitoring is needed.\nSection::::Approaches.:Recursive least square adaptive filters.\n2D Recursive Least Square Adaptive Filters can be developed by applying 1D recursive least squares filters along both horizontal and vertical directions. The RLS adaptive is an algorithm which finds the filter coefficients recursively to minimize the weighted least squares cost function. The RLS algorithm is different to the least mean squares algorithm which aim to reduce the mean square error, its input signal is considered deterministic. For this reason, the RLS algorithm has fast convergence characteristic.\nAdvantages: The RLS algorithm has fast convergence property. The accuracy of image denoising based on RLS algorithm is better than 2D LMS adaptive filters.\nDisadvantages: The RLS algorithm needs a large amount of computations, especially in two-dimensional and multidimensional case.\nSection::::Approaches.:Lexicographic Ordering.\nOne convenient approach to implement 2D Adaptive Filters is to transform the 2D problem into a 1D problem by lexicographic ordering. This simplifies the implementation and makes it possible to benefit from the extensive literature that is available for 1D adaptive filters and utilize all of the existing 1D algorithms.\nSection::::Approaches.:McClellan Transformations.\nMcClellan transformations can be used to transform a 1D filter design into a 2D filter design by using a transformation function.

The goal of Q-learning is to learn a policy, which tells an agent what action to take under what circumstances. It does not require a model (hence the connotation \"model-free\") of the environment, and it can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards, without requiring adaptations.\nFor any finite Markov decision process (FMDP), \"Q\"-learning finds a policy that is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the expected value of the total reward over any and all successive steps, starting from the current state. \"Q\"-learning can identify an optimal action-selection policy for any given FMDP, given infinite exploration time and a partly-random policy. \"Q\" names the function that returns the reward used to provide the reinforcement and can be said to stand for the \"quality\" of an action taken in a given state."], "wikipedia-66294": ["Assuming full knowledge of the MDP, the two basic approaches to compute the optimal action-value function are value iteration and policy iteration. Both algorithms compute a sequence of functions formula_60 (formula_61) that converge to formula_59. Computing these functions involves computing expectations over the whole state-space, which is impractical for all but the smallest (finite) MDPs. In reinforcement learning methods, expectations are approximated by averaging over samples and using function approximation techniques to cope with the need to represent value functions over large state-action spaces.\n\nMonte Carlo methods can be used in an algorithm that mimics policy iteration. Policy iteration consists of two steps: \"policy evaluation\" and \"policy improvement\".\n\nMonte Carlo is used in the policy evaluation step. In this step, given a stationary, deterministic policy formula_25, the goal is to compute the function values formula_64 (or a good approximation to them) for all state-action pairs formula_48. Assuming (for simplicity) that the MDP is finite, that sufficient memory is available to accommodate the action-values and that the problem is episodic and after each episode a new one starts from some random initial state. Then, the estimate of the value of a given state-action pair formula_48 can be computed by averaging the sampled returns that originated from formula_48 over time. Given sufficient time, this procedure can thus construct a precise estimate formula_68 of the action-value function formula_69. This finishes the description of the policy evaluation step.\n\nIn the policy improvement step, the next policy is obtained by computing a \"greedy\" policy with respect to formula_68: Given a state formula_2, this new policy returns an action that maximizes formula_72. In practice lazy evaluation can defer the computation of the maximizing actions to when they are needed.\n\nThe first problem is corrected by allowing the procedure to change the policy (at some or all states) before the values settle. This too may be problematic as it might prevent convergence. Most current algorithms do this, giving rise to the class of \"generalized policy iteration\" algorithms. Many \"actor critic\" methods belong to this category.\n\nThe second issue can be corrected by allowing trajectories to contribute to any state-action pair in them. This may also help to some extent with the third problem, although a better solution when returns have high variance is Sutton's temporal difference (TD) methods that are based on the recursive Bellman equation. Note that the computation in TD methods can be incremental (when after each transition the memory is changed and the transition is thrown away), or batch (when the transitions are batched and the estimates are computed once based on the batch). Batch methods, such as the least-squares temporal difference method, may use the information in the samples better, while incremental methods are the only choice when batch methods are infeasible due to their high computational or memory complexity. Some methods try to combine the two approaches. Methods based on temporal differences also overcome the fourth issue.\n\nIn order to address the fifth issue, \"function approximation methods\" are used. \"Linear function approximation\" starts with a mapping formula_73 that assigns a finite-dimensional vector to each state-action pair. Then, the action values of a state-action pair formula_48 are obtained by linearly combining the components of formula_75 with some \"weights\" formula_76:\nThe algorithms then adjust the weights, instead of adjusting the values associated with the individual state-action pairs. Methods based on ideas from nonparametric statistics (which can be seen to construct their own features) have been explored.\n\nValue iteration can also be used as a starting point, giving rise to the Q-learning algorithm and its many variants. \n\nAn alternative method is to search directly in (some subset of) the policy space, in which case the problem becomes a case of stochastic optimization. The two approaches available are gradient-based and gradient-free methods.\n\nGradient-based methods (\"policy gradient methods\") start with a mapping from a finite-dimensional (parameter) space to the space of policies: given the parameter vector formula_76, let formula_81 denote the policy associated to formula_76. Defining the performance function by\nunder mild conditions this function will be differentiable as a function of the parameter vector formula_76. If the gradient of formula_85 was known, one could use gradient ascent. Since an analytic expression for the gradient is not available, only a noisy estimate is available. Such an estimate can be constructed in many ways, giving rise to algorithms such as Williams' REINFORCE method (which is known as the likelihood ratio method in the simulation-based optimization literature). Policy search methods have been used in the robotics context. Many policy search methods may get stuck in local optima (as they are based on local search).\n\nA large class of methods avoids relying on gradient information. These include simulated annealing, cross-entropy search or methods of evolutionary computation. Many gradient-free methods can achieve (in theory and in the limit) a global optimum.\n\nPolicy search methods may converge slowly given noisy data. For example, this happens in episodic problems when the trajectories are long and the variance of the returns is large.

This led to the physical symbol system hypothesis, that a physical agent that can manipulate symbols is necessary and sufficient for intelligence. Many software agents still use this approach for action selection. It normally requires describing all sensor readings, the world, all of ones actions and all of one's goals in some form of predicate logic. Critics of this approach complain that it is too slow for real-time planning and that, despite the proofs, it is still unlikely to produce optimal plans because reducing descriptions of reality to logic is a process prone to errors.\nSatisficing is a decision-making strategy which attempts to meet criteria for adequacy, rather than identify an optimal solution. A satisficing strategy may often, in fact, be (near) optimal if the costs of the decision-making process itself, such as the cost of obtaining complete information, are considered in the outcome calculus.\nGoal driven architectures \u2013 In these symbolic architectures, the agent's behaviour is typically described by a set of goals. Each goal can be achieved by a process or an activity, which is described by a prescripted plan. The agent must just decide which process to carry on to accomplish a given goal. The plan can expand to subgoals, which makes the process slightly recursive. Technically, more or less, the plans exploits condition-rules. These architectures are reactive or hybrid. Classical examples of goal driven architectures are implementable refinements of belief-desire-intention architecture like JAM or IVE. \nSection::::AI mechanisms.:Distributed approaches.\nIn contrast to the symbolic approach, distributed systems of action selection actually have no one \"box\" in the agent which decides the next action. At least in their idealized form, distributed systems have many modules running in parallel and determining the best action based on local expertise. In these idealized systems, overall coherence is expected to emerge somehow, possibly through careful design of the interacting components. This approach is often inspired by artificial neural networks research. In practice, there is almost always \"some\" centralised system determining which module is \"the most active\" or has the most salience. There is evidence real biological brains also have such executive decision systems which evaluate which of the competing systems deserves the most attention, or more properly, has its desired actions disinhibited.\nBULLET::::- ASMO is an attention-based architecture developed by Rony Novianto.

In contrast to classical planning methods, reactive or dynamic approaches do not suffer combinatorial explosion. On the other hand, they are sometimes seen as too rigid to be considered strong AI, since the plans are coded in advance. At the same time, natural intelligence can be rigid in some contexts although it is fluid and able to adapt in others.\nExample dynamic planning mechanisms include:\nBULLET::::- Finite-state machines These are reactive architectures used mostly for computer game agents, in particular for first-person shooters bots, or for virtual movie actors.

Each step of training has a wider impact on the value function approximation because when the offset grids are summed, the information is diffused.\nSection::::Techniques used to solve mountain car.:Function approximation.\nFunction approximation is another way to solve the mountain car. By choosing a set of basis functions beforehand, or by generating them as the car drives, the agent can approximate the value function at each state. Unlike the step-wise version of the value function created with discretization, function approximation can more cleanly estimate the true smooth function of the mountain car domain.\nSection::::Techniques used to solve mountain car.:Eligibility Traces.\nAn interesting aspect of the problem involves the delay of actual reward. The agent isn't able to learn about the goal until a successful completion. Given a naive approach for each trial the car can only backup the reward of the goal slightly. This is a problem for naive discretization because each discrete state will only be backed up once, taking a larger number of episodes to learn the problem. This problem can be alleviated via the mechanism of eligibility traces, which will automatically backup the reward given to states before, dramatically increasing the speed of learning. Eligibility traces can be viewed as a bridge from temporal difference learning methods to Monte Carlo methods."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

This dichotomy between competence and performance is well known and studied in linguistics, as proposed by Noam Chomsky. Their approach faces both dimensions with reinforcement learning (RL). Offline training is used to bootstrap the learning process. This can be done by letting the agent play against itself (selflearning), other pre-programmed agents, or human players. Then, online learning is used to continually adapt this initially built-in intelligence to each specific human opponent, in order to discover the most suitable strategy to play against him or her. Concerning performance, their idea is to find an adequate policy for choosing actions that provide a good game balance, i.e., actions that keep both agent and human player at approximately the same performance level. According to the difficulty the player is facing, the agent chooses actions with high or low expected performance. For a given situation, if the game level is too hard, the agent does not choose the optimal action (provided by the RL framework), but chooses progressively less and less suboptimal actions until its performance is as good as the player's. Similarly, if the game level becomes too easy, it will choose actions whose values are higher, possibly until it reaches the optimal performance."], "wikipedia-66294": ["The environment is typically formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), as many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context utilize dynamic programming techniques. The main difference between the classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible.\n\nThe exploration vs. exploitation trade-off has been most thoroughly studied through the multi-armed bandit problem and for finite state space MDPs in Burnetas and Katehakis (1997). Reinforcement learning requires clever exploration mechanisms. Randomly selecting actions, without reference to an estimated probability distribution, shows poor performance. The case of (small) finite Markov decision processes is relatively well understood. However, due to the lack of algorithms that scale well with the number of states (or scale to problems with infinite state spaces), simple exploration methods are the most practical. One such method is formula_15-greedy, when the agent chooses the action that it believes has the best long-term effect with probability formula_16. If no action which satisfies this condition is found, the agent chooses an action uniformly at random. Here, formula_17 is a tuning parameter, which is sometimes changed, either according to a fixed schedule (making the agent explore progressively less), or adaptively based on heuristics.\n\nThe brute force approach entails two steps:\nBULLET::::- For each possible policy, sample returns while following it\nBULLET::::- Choose the policy with the largest expected return\nOne problem with this is that the number of policies can be large, or even infinite. Another is that variance of the returns may be large, which requires many samples to accurately estimate the return of each policy. These problems can be ameliorated if we assume some structure and allow samples generated from one policy to influence the estimates made for others. The two main approaches for achieving this are value function estimation and direct policy search.\n\nValue function approaches attempt to find a policy that maximizes the return by maintaining a set of estimates of expected returns for some policy (usually either the \"current\" [on-policy] or the optimal [off-policy] one)."], "wikipedia-5033373": ["Generally, artificial action selection mechanisms can be divided into several categories: symbol-based systems sometimes known as classical planning, distributed solutions, and reactive or dynamic planning. Some approaches do not fall neatly into any one of these categories. Others are really more about providing scientific models than practical AI control; these last are described further in the next section.\n\nEarly in the history of artificial intelligence, it was assumed that the best way for an agent to choose what to do next would be to compute a probably optimal plan, and then execute that plan. This led to the physical symbol system hypothesis, that a physical agent that can manipulate symbols is necessary and sufficient for intelligence. Many software agents still use this approach for action selection. It normally requires describing all sensor readings, the world, all of ones actions and all of one's goals in some form of predicate logic. Critics of this approach complain that it is too slow for real-time planning and that, despite the proofs, it is still unlikely to produce optimal plans because reducing descriptions of reality to logic is a process prone to errors.\n\nGoal driven architectures \u2013 In these symbolic architectures, the agent's behaviour is typically described by a set of goals. Each goal can be achieved by a process or an activity, which is described by a prescripted plan. The agent must just decide which process to carry on to accomplish a given goal. The plan can expand to subgoals, which makes the process slightly recursive. Technically, more or less, the plans exploits condition-rules. These architectures are reactive or hybrid. Classical examples of goal driven architectures are implementable refinements of belief-desire-intention architecture like JAM or IVE.\n\nIn contrast to the symbolic approach, distributed systems of action selection actually have no one \"box\" in the agent which decides the next action. At least in their idealized form, distributed systems have many modules running in parallel and determining the best action based on local expertise. In these idealized systems, overall coherence is expected to emerge somehow, possibly through careful design of the interacting components. This approach is often inspired by artificial neural networks research. In practice, there is almost always \"some\" centralised system determining which module is \"the most active\" or has the most salience. There is evidence real biological brains also have such executive decision systems which evaluate which of the competing systems deserves the most attention, or more properly, has its desired actions disinhibited.\n\nBULLET::::- ASMO is an attention-based architecture developed by Rony Novianto.

In this form, separate modules respond to different stimuli and generate their own responses. In the original form, the subsumption architecture, these consisted of different layers which could monitor and suppress each other's inputs and outputs.\nBULLET::::- Creatures are virtual pets from a computer game driven by three-layered neural network, which is adaptive. Their mechanism is reactive since the network at every time step determines the task that has to be performed by the pet. The network is described well in the paper of Grand et al.

See also the Creatures Wiki.\n\nDynamic or reactive planning methods compute just one next action in every instant based on the current context and pre-scripted plans. In contrast to classical planning methods, reactive or dynamic approaches do not suffer combinatorial explosion. On the other hand, they are sometimes seen as too rigid to be considered strong AI, since the plans are coded in advance. At the same time, natural intelligence can be rigid in some contexts although it is fluid and able to adapt in others.\n\nExample dynamic planning mechanisms include:\nBULLET::::- Finite-state machines These are reactive architectures used mostly for computer game agents, in particular for first-person shooters bots, or for virtual movie actors.

In all cases, it is necessary to measure, implicitly or explicitly, the difficulty the user is facing at a given moment. This measure can be performed by a heuristic function, which some authors call \"challenge function\". This function maps a given game state into a value that specifies how easy or difficult the game feels to the user at a specific moment. Examples of heuristics used are:\nBULLET::::- The rate of successful shots or hits\nBULLET::::- The numbers of won and lost pieces\nBULLET::::- Life points\nBULLET::::- Evolution\nBULLET::::- Time to complete some task\n... or any metric used to calculate a game score. Chris Crawford said \"If I were to make a graph of a typical player's score as a function of time spent within the game, that graph should show a curve sloping smoothly and steadily upward. I describe such a game as having a positive monotonic curve\". Games without such a curve seem \"either too hard or too easy\", he said.\nHunicke and Chapman's approach controls the game environment settings in order to make challenges easier or harder. For example, if the game is too hard, the player gets more weapons, recovers life points faster, or faces fewer opponents. Although this approach may be effective, its application can result in implausible situations. A straightforward approach is to combine such \"parameters manipulation\" to some mechanisms to modify the behavior of the non-player characters (characters controlled by the computer and usually modeled as intelligent agents). This adjustment, however, should be made with moderation, to avoid the 'rubber band' effect. One example of this effect in a racing game would involve the AI driver's vehicles becoming significantly faster when behind the player's vehicle, and significantly slower while in front, as if the two vehicles were connected by a large rubber band.\nA traditional implementation of such an agent's intelligence is to use behavior rules, defined during game development. A typical rule in a fighting game would state \"punch opponent if he is reachable, chase him otherwise\". Extending such an approach to include opponent modeling can be made through Spronck \"et al.\"\u2032s dynamic scripting, which assigns to each rule a probability of being picked. Rule weights can be dynamically updated throughout the game, accordingly to the opponent skills, leading to adaptation to the specific user. With a simple mechanism, rules can be picked that generate tactics that are neither too strong nor too weak for the current player.\nAndrade \"et al.\" divide the DGB problem into two dimensions: competence (learn as well as possible) and performance (act just as well as necessary).

Similarly, if the game level becomes too easy, it will choose actions whose values are higher, possibly until it reaches the optimal performance.\nDemasi and Cruz built intelligent agents employing genetic algorithms techniques to keep alive agents that best fit the user level. Online coevolution is used in order to speed up the learning process. Online coevolution uses pre-defined models (agents with good genetic features) as parents in the genetic operations, so that the evolution is biased by them. These models are constructed by offline training or by hand, when the agent genetic encoding is simple enough.\nOther work in the field of DGB is based on the hypothesis that the player-opponent interaction\u2014rather than the audiovisual features, the context or the genre of the game\u2014is the property that contributes the majority of the quality features of entertainment in a computer game. Based on this fundamental assumption, a metric for measuring the real time entertainment value of predator/prey games was introduced, and established as efficient and reliable by validation against human judgment.\nFurther studies by Yannakakis and Hallam have shown that artificial neural networks (ANN) and fuzzy neural networks can extract a better estimator of player satisfaction than a human-designed one, given appropriate estimators of the challenge and curiosity (intrinsic qualitative factors for engaging gameplay according to Malone) of the game and data on human players' preferences. The approach of constructing user models of the player of a game that can predict the answers to which variants of the game are more or less \"fun\" is defined as \"Entertainment Modeling\". The model is usually constructed using machine learning techniques applied to game parameters derived from player-game interaction and/or statistical features of player's physiological signals recorded during play.

Financial stability is paramount for economic growth, as most transactions in the real economy are made through the financial system.\n\nWithout financial stability, banks are more reluctant to finance profitable projects, asset prices may deviate significantly from their intrinsic values, and the payment settlement schedule diverges from the norm. Hence, financial stability is essential for maintaining confidence in the economy. Possible consequences of excessive instability include financial crisis, bank runs, hyperinflation, and stock market crashes.\n\nSection::::Empirical measures.\nSection::::Empirical measures.:Firm-level stability measures.\nThe Altman\u2019s z\u2010score is extensively used in empirical research as a measure of firm-level stability for its high correlation with the probability of default.

In different iterations of the model, the asset/liability level could be set at different threshold levels.\nIn subsequent research, Merton\u2019s model has been modified to capture a wider array of financial activity using credit default swap data. For example, Moody\u2019s uses it in the KMV model both to calculate the probability of credit default and as part of their credit risk management system. The Distance to Default (DD) is another market-based measure of corporate default risk based on Merton\u2019s model. It measures both solvency risk and liquidity risk at the firm level.\nSection::::Empirical measures.:Systemic stability measures.\nUnfortunately, there is not yet a singular, standardized model for assessing financial system stability and for examining policies.\nTo measure systemic stability, a number of studies attempt to aggregate firm-level stability measures (z-score and distance to default) into a system-wide evaluation of stability, either by taking a simple average or weighing each measure by the institution\u2019s relative size. However, these aggregate measures fail to account for correlated risks among financial institutions. In other words, the model fails to consider the inter-connectedness between institutions, and that one institution\u2019s failure can lead to a contagion.\nThe First-to-Default probability, or the probability of observing one default among a number of institutions, has been proposed as a measure of systemic risk for a group of large financial institutions. This measure looks at risk-neutral default probabilities from credit default swap spreads. Unlike distance-to-default measures, the probability recognizes the interconnectedness among defaults of different institutions. However, studies focusing on probabilities of default tend to overlook the ripper effect caused by the failing of a large institution.\nAnother assessment of financial system stability is Systemic Expected Shortfall (SES), which measures the contribution to systemic risk by individual institutions. SES considers individual leverage level and measures the externalities created from the banking sector when these institutions fail. The model is especially apt at identifying which institutions are systemically relevant and would impact the most on the economy when it fails. One drawback of the SES method is that it is difficult to determine when the systemically-important institutions are likely to fail.\nTo enhance predictive power, the retrospective SES measure was extended and modified in later research. The enhanced model is called SRISK, which evaluates the expected capital shortfall for a firm in a crisis scenario. To calculate this SRISK, one should first determine the Long-Run Marginal Expected Shortfall (LRMES), which measures the relationship between a firm\u2019s equity returns and the market\u2019s return (estimated using asymmetric volatility, correlation, and copula). Then, the model estimates the drop in the firm\u2019s equity value if the aggregate market experiences a 40% or larger fall in a six-month period to determine how much capital is needed in order to achieve an 8% capital to asset value ratio. In other words, SRISK gives insights into the firm\u2019s percentage of total financial sector capital shortfall. A high SRISK % indicates the biggest losers when a crisis strikes. One implication of the SES indicator is that a firm is considered \u201csystemically risky\u201d if it faces a high probability of capital shortage when the financial sector is weak.\nAnother gauge of financial stability is the distribution of systemic loss, which attempts to fill some of the gaps of the aforementioned measures. This measure incorporates three key elements: each individual institution\u2019s probability of default, the size of loss given a default, and the contagion resulting from defaults interconnected institutions."], "wikipedia-1276489": ["The stability of a slope is essentially controlled by the ratio between the available shear strength and the acting shear stress, which can be expressed in terms of a safety factor if these quantities are integrated over a potential (or actual) sliding surface.

Similarly, a slope can be locally stable if a safety factor larger than 1 is computed along any potential sliding surface running through a limited portion of the slope (for instance only within its toe). Values of the global or local safety factors close to 1 (typically comprised between 1 and 1.3, depending on regulations) indicate marginally stable slopes that require attention, monitoring and/or an engineering intervention (slope stabilization) to increase the safety factor and reduce the probability of a slope movement."], "wikipedia-465183": ["Reliability relates to the consistency of an assessment. A reliable assessment is one that consistently achieves the same results with the same (or similar) cohort of students. Various factors affect reliability\u2014including ambiguous questions, too many options within a question paper, vague marking instructions and poorly trained markers. Traditionally, the reliability of an assessment is based on the following:\nBULLET::::1. Temporal stability: Performance on a test is comparable on two or more separate occasions.\nBULLET::::2. Form equivalence: Performance among examinees is equivalent on different forms of a test based on the same content.\nBULLET::::3. Internal consistency: Responses on a test are consistent across questions. For example: In a survey that asks respondents to rate attitudes toward technology, consistency would be expected in responses to the following questions:\nBULLET::::- \"I feel very negative about computers in general.\"\nBULLET::::- \"I enjoy using computers.\"\nThe reliability of a measurement x can also be defined quantitatively as:\nformula_1 where formula_2 is the reliability in the observed (test) score, x; \nformula_3 and formula_4 are the variability in \u2018true\u2019 (i.e., candidate\u2019s innate performance) and measured test scores respectively. formula_2 can range from 0 (completely unreliable), to 1 (completely reliable)."], "wikipedia-21757046": ["To distinguish between the different states of fluid flow one must consider how the fluid reacts to a disturbance in the initial state. These disturbances will relate to the initial properties of the system, such as velocity, pressure, and density. James Clerk Maxwell expressed the qualitative concept of stable and unstable flow nicely when he said: \"when an infinitely small variation of the present state will alter only by an infinitely small quantity the state at some future time, the condition of the system, whether at rest or in motion, is said to be stable but when an infinitely small variation in the present state may bring about a finite difference in the state of the system in a finite time, the system is said to be unstable.\" \nThat means that for a stable flow, any infinitely small variation, which is considered a disturbance, will not have any noticeable effect on the initial state of the system and will eventually die down in time. For a fluid flow to be considered stable it must be stable with respect to every possible disturbance. This implies that there exists no mode of disturbance for which it is unstable.\nOn the other hand, for an unstable flow, any variations will have some noticeable effect on the state of the system which would then cause the disturbance to grow in amplitude in such a way that the system progressively departs from the initial state and never returns to it. This means that there is at least one mode of disturbance with respect to which the flow is unstable, and the disturbance will therefore distort the existing force equilibrium.\nA key tool used to determine the stability of a flow is the Reynolds number (Re), first put forward by George Gabriel Stokes at the start of the 1850s. Associated with Osborne Reynolds who further developed the idea in the early 1880s, this dimensionless number gives the ratio of inertial terms and viscous terms. In a physical sense, this number is a ratio of the forces which are due to the momentum of the fluid (inertial terms), and the forces which arise from the relative motion of the different layers of a flowing fluid (viscous terms). The equation for this is\nwhere\nThe Reynolds number is useful because it can provide cut off points for when flow is stable or unstable, namely the Critical Reynolds number formula_7. As it increases, the amplitude of a disturbance which could then lead to instability gets smaller. At high Reynolds numbers it is agreed that fluid flows will be unstable. High Reynolds number can be achieved in several ways, e.g. if formula_8 is a small value or if formula_9 and formula_10 are high values. This means that instabilities will arise almost immediately and the flow will become unstable or turbulent.\nIn order to analytically find the stability of fluid flows, it is useful to note that hydrodynamic stability has a lot in common with stability in other fields, such as magnetohydrodynamics, plasma physics and elasticity; although the physics is different in each case, the mathematics and the techniques used are similar. The essential problem is modeled by nonlinear partial differential equations and the stability of known steady and unsteady solutions are examined. The governing equations for almost all hydrodynamic stability problems are the Navier\u2013Stokes equation and the continuity equation. The Navier\u2013Stokes equation is given by:\nwhere\nBULLET::::- formula_12\nBULLET::::- formula_13\nBULLET::::- formula_14\nBULLET::::- formula_15\nBULLET::::- formula_16\nBULLET::::- formula_17\nHere formula_18 is being used as an operator acting on the velocity field on the left hand side of the equation and then acting on the pressure on the right hand side.\nand the continuity equation is given by:\nwhere\nBULLET::::- formula_20\nOnce again formula_18 is being used as an operator on formula_22 and is calculating the divergence of the velocity.\nbut if the fluid being considered is incompressible, which means the density is constant, then formula_23 and hence:\nThe assumption that a flow is incompressible is a good one and applies to most fluids travelling at most speeds. It is assumptions of this form that will help to simplify the Navier\u2013Stokes equation into differential equations, like Euler's equation, which are easier to work with.\nIf one considers a flow which is inviscid, this is where the viscous forces are small and can therefore be neglected in the calculations, then one arrives at Euler's equations:\nAlthough in this case we have assumed an inviscid fluid this assumption does not hold for flows where there is a boundary. The presence of a boundary causes some viscosity at the boundary layer which cannot be neglected and one arrives back at the Navier\u2013Stokes equation. Finding the solutions to these governing equations under different circumstances and determining their stability is the fundamental principle in determining the stability of the fluid flow itself.\nTo determine whether the flow is stable or unstable, one often employs the method of linear stability analysis. In this type of analysis, the governing equations and boundary conditions are linearized. This is based on the fact that the concept of 'stable' or 'unstable' is based on an infinitely small disturbance. For such disturbances, it is reasonable to assume that disturbances of different wavelengths evolve independently. (A nonlinear governing equation will allow disturbances of different wavelengths to interact with each other.)"], "wikipedia-41336": ["The long-term stability of an oscillator is the degree of uniformity of frequency over time, when the frequency is measured under identical environmental conditions, such as supply voltage, load, and temperature.

Randomly selecting actions, without reference to an estimated probability distribution, shows poor performance. The case of (small) finite Markov decision processes is relatively well understood. However, due to the lack of algorithms that scale well with the number of states (or scale to problems with infinite state spaces), simple exploration methods are the most practical.\n\nOne such method is formula_15-greedy, when the agent chooses the action that it believes has the best long-term effect with probability formula_16.

System bias in recommendations often stems from skewed training data, over-reliance on popularity, or feedback loops, which can reinforce existing preferences and exclude diverse or novel content. This may lead to irrelevant suggestions for users with atypical preferences or underrepresented groups. Wikipedia\u2019s coverage of these concepts can help clarify how biases in design or data propagate into flawed recommendations.", "wikipedia-41145357": ["Automation bias is the propensity for humans to favor suggestions from automated decision-making systems and to ignore contradictory information made without automation, even if it is correct. Automation bias stems from the social psychology literature that found a bias in human-human interaction that showed that people assign more positive evaluations to decisions made by humans than to a neutral object. The same type of positivity bias has been found for human-automation interaction, where the automated decisions are rated more positively than neutral. This has become a growing problem for decision making as intensive care units, nuclear power plants, and aircraft cockpits have increasingly integrated computerized system monitors and decision aids to mostly factor out possible human error. Errors of automation bias tend to occur when decision-making is dependent on computers or other automated aids and the human is in an observatory role but able to make decisions. Examples of automation bias range from urgent matters like flying a plane on automatic pilot to such mundane matters as the use of spell-checking programs.\n\nThe tendency toward overreliance on automated aids is known as \"automation misuse\". Misuse of automation can be seen when a user fails to properly monitor an automated system, or when the automated system is used when it should not be. This is in contrast to disuse, where the user does not properly utilize the automation either by turning it off or ignoring it. Both misuse and disuse can be problematic, but automation bias is directly related to misuse of the automation through either too much trust in the abilities of the system, or defaulting to using heuristics. Misuse can lead to lack of monitoring of the automated system or blind agreement with an automation suggestion, categorized by two types of errors, errors of omission and errors of commission, respectively.\n\nAutomation bias can take the form of commission errors, which occur when users follow an automated directive without taking into account other sources of information. Conversely, omission errors occur when automated devices fail to detect or indicate problems and the user does not notice because they are not properly monitoring the system.\n\nErrors of omission have been shown to result from cognitive vigilance decrements, while errors of commission result from a combination of a failure to take information into account and an excessive trust in the reliability of automated aids. Errors of commission occur for three reasons: (1) overt redirection of attention away from the automated aid; (2) diminished attention to the aid; (3) active discounting of information that counters the aid's recommendations. Omission errors occur when the human decision-maker fails to notice an automation failure, either due to low vigilance or overtrust in the system. For example, a spell-checking program incorrectly marking a word as misspelled and suggesting an alternative would be an error of commission, and a spell-checking program failing to notice a misspelled word would be an error of omission. In these cases, automation bias could be observed by a user accepting the alternative word without consulting a dictionary, or a user not noticing the incorrectly misspelled word and assuming all the words are correct without reviewing the words.\n\nThe presence of automatic aids, as one source puts it, \"diminishes the likelihood that decision makers will either make the cognitive effort to seek other diagnostic information or process all available information in cognitively complex ways.\" It also renders users more likely to conclude their assessment of a situation too hastily after being prompted by an automatic aid to take a specific course of action.\n\nAccording to one source, there are three main factors that lead to automation bias. First, the human tendency to choose the least cognitive approach to decision-making, which is called the cognitive miser hypothesis. Second, the tendency of humans to view automated aids as having an analytical ability superior to their own. Third, the tendency of humans to reduce their own effort when sharing tasks, either with another person or with an automated aid.\n\nOther factors leading to an over-reliance on automation and thus to automation bias include inexperience in a task (though inexperienced users tend to be most benefited by automated decision support systems), lack of confidence in one's own abilities, a lack of readily available alternative information, or desire to save time and effort on complex tasks or high workloads. It has been shown that people who have greater confidence in their own decision-making abilities tend to be less reliant on external automated support, while those with more trust in decision support systems (DSS) were more dependent upon it."], "wikipedia-55817338": ["Bias can emerge due to many factors, including but not limited to the design of the algorithm itself, unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm. Algorithmic bias is found across platforms, including but not limited to search engine results and social media platforms, and can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing social biases of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. The study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect \"systematic and unfair\" discrimination.\n\nOther algorithms may reinforce stereotypes and preferences as they process and display \"relevant\" data for human users, for example, by selecting information based on previous choices of a similar user or group of users.\n\nMeanwhile, recommendation engines that work by associating users with similar users, or that make use of inferred marketing traits, might rely on inaccurate associations that reflect broad ethnic, gender, socio-economic, or racial stereotypes."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Our research reveals three important findings: (1) Differences between algorithms: recommendations generated by simpler algorithms tend to be more stereotypical but less biased than those generated by more complex algorithms.

This information is needed to let each EA to measure the coordination objectives of the solutions encoded in its own population, taking into account the possible optimal solutions of the remaining populations of the other EAs.

A uniquely identified client is usually a combination of a machine (one's desktop computer at work for example) and a browser (Firefox on that machine). The identification is usually via a persistent cookie that has been placed on the computer by the site page code. An older method, used in log file analysis, is the unique combination of the computer's IP address and the User Agent (browser) information provided to the web server by the browser. It is important to understand that the \"Visitor\" is not the same as the human being sitting at the computer at the time of the visit, since an individual human can use different computers or, on the same computer, can use different browsers, and will be seen as a different visitor in each circumstance. Increasingly, but still somewhat rarely, visitors are uniquely identified by Flash LSO's (Local Shared Object), which are less susceptible to privacy enforcement.\n- Visit / Session - A visit or session is defined as a series of page requests or, in the case of tags, image requests from the same uniquely identified client. A unique client is commonly identified by an IP address or a unique ID that is placed in the browser cookie. A visit is considered ended when no requests have been recorded in some number of elapsed minutes. A 30-minute limit (\"time out\") is used by many analytics tools but can, in some tools (such as Google Analytics), be changed to another number of minutes. Analytics data collectors and analysis tools have no reliable way of knowing if a visitor has looked at other sites between page views; a visit is considered one visit as long as the events (page views, clicks, whatever is being recorded) are 30 minutes or less closer together. Note that a visit can consist of one page view, or thousands. A unique visit's session can also be extended if the time between page loads indicates that a visitor has been viewing the pages continuously.\n- Active Time / Engagement Time - Average amount of time that visitors spend actually interacting with content on a web page, based on mouse moves, clicks, hovers and scrolls. Unlike Session Duration and Page View Duration / Time on Page, this metric can accurately measure the length of engagement in the final page view, but it is not available in many analytics tools or data collection methods.\n- Average Page Depth / Page Views per Average Session - Page Depth is the approximate \"size\" of an average visit, calculated by dividing total number of page views by total number of visits.\n- Average Page View Duration - Average amount of time that visitors spend on an average page of the site.\n- Click - \"refers to a single instance of a user following a hyperlink from one page in a site to another\".\n- Event - A discrete action or class of actions that occurs on a website. A page view is a type of event. Events also encapsulate clicks, form submissions, keypress events, and other client-side user actions.\n- Exit Rate / % Exit - A statistic applied to an individual page, not a web site. The percentage of visits seeing a page where that page is the final page viewed in the visit.\n- First Visit / First Session - (also called 'Absolute Unique Visitor' in some tools) A visit from a uniquely identified client that has theoretically not made any previous visits. Since the only way of knowing whether the uniquely identified client has been to the site before is the presence of a persistent cookie or via digital fingerprinting that had been received on a previous visit, the \"First Visit\" label is not reliable if the site's cookies have been deleted since their previous visit.\n- Frequency / Session per Unique - Frequency measures how often visitors come to a website in a given time period. It is calculated by dividing the total number of sessions (or visits) by the total number of unique visitors during a specified time period, such as a month or year. Sometimes it is used interchangeable with the term \"loyalty.\"\n- Impression - The most common definition of \"Impression\" is an instance of an advertisement appearing on a viewed page. Note that an advertisement can be displayed on a viewed page below the area actually displayed on the screen, so most measures of impressions do not necessarily mean an advertisement has been view-able.\n- New Visitor - A visitor that has not made any previous visits. This definition creates a certain amount of confusion (see common confusions below), and is sometimes substituted with analysis of first visits.\n- Page Time Viewed / Page Visibility Time / Page View Duration - The time a single page (or a blog, Ad Banner...) is on the screen, measured as the calculated difference between the time of the request for that page and the time of the next recorded request. If there is no next recorded request, then the viewing time of that instance of that page is not included in reports.\n- Repeat Visitor - A visitor that has made at least one previous visit. The period between the last and current visit is called visitor recency and is measured in days.\n- Return Visitor - A Unique visitor with activity consisting of a visit to a site during a reporting period and where the Unique visitor visited the site prior to the reporting period. The individual is counted only once during the reporting period.\n- Session Duration / Visit Duration - Average amount of time that visitors spend on the site each time they visit.It is calculated as the sum total of the duration of all the sessions divided by the total number of sessions.

It can be viewed as a form of supervised learning, where the training dataset consists of task executions by a demonstration teacher.\n\nMapping methods try to mimic the expert by forming a direct mapping from the states to the actions.\n\nSystem models try to mimic the expert by modeling world dynamics.\n\nInverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is the process of deriving a reward function from observed behavior. While ordinary 'reinforcement learning' involves using rewards and punishments to learn behavior, in IRL the direction is reversed, and a robot observes a person's behavior to figure out what goal that behavior seems to be trying to achieve. The IRL problem can be defined as:\nGiven 1) measurements of an agent's behaviour over time, in a variety of circumstances; 2) measurements of the sensory inputs to that agent; 3) a model of the physical environment (including the agent's body): Determine the reward function that the agent is optimizing.\n\nLearning from demonstration is often explained from a perspective that the working Robot-control-system is available and the human-demonstrator is using it. And indeed, if the software works, the Human operator takes the robot-arm, makes a move with it, and the robot will reproduce the action later. For example, he teaches the robot-arm how to put a cup under a coffeemaker and press the start-button. In the replay phase, the robot is imitating this behavior 1:1. But that is not how the system works internally; it is only what the audience can observe. In reality, Learning from demonstration is much more complex.\n\nThe overall task consists of two parts: recording the angle over time and reproducing the recorded motion. The reproducing step is surprisingly simple. As an input we know, in which time step which angle the pendulum must have. Bringing the system to a state is called 'Tracking control' or PID control. That means, we have a trajectory over time, and must find control actions to map the system to this trajectory. Other authors call the principle 'steering behavior', because the aim is to bring a robot to a given line."], "wikipedia-52462": ["Observational learning is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings. Particularly in childhood, a model is someone of authority or higher status in an environment.\n\nBandura's social cognitive learning theory states that there are four stages involved in observational learning:\nBULLET::::1. Attention: Observers cannot learn unless they pay attention to what's happening around them. This process is influenced by characteristics of the model, such as how much one likes or identifies with the model, and by characteristics of the observer, such as the observer's expectations or level of emotional arousal.\nBULLET::::2. Retention/Memory: Observers must not only recognize the observed behavior but also remember it at some later time. This process depends on the observer's ability to code or structure the information in an easily remembered form or to mentally or physically rehearse the model's actions.\nBULLET::::3. Initiation/Motor: Observers must be physically and/intellectually capable of producing the act. In many cases the observer possesses the necessary responses. But sometimes, reproducing the model's actions may involve skills the observer has not yet acquired. It is one thing to carefully watch a circus juggler, but it is quite another to go home and repeat those acts.\nBULLET::::4. Motivation: The observer must have motivation to recreate the observed behavior.\n\nBandura clearly distinguishes between learning and performance. Unless motivated, a person does not produce learned behavior. This motivation can come from external reinforcement, such as the experimenter's promise of reward in some of Bandura's studies, or the bribe of a parent. Or it can come from vicarious reinforcement, based on the observation that models are rewarded. High-status models can affect performance through motivation."], "wikipedia-330102": ["Social Learning Theory integrated behavioral and cognitive theories of learning in order to provide a comprehensive model that could account for the wide range of learning experiences that occur in the real world. As initially outlined by Bandura and Walters in 1963 and further detailed in 1977, key tenets of Social Learning Theory are as follows:\nBULLET::::1. Learning is not purely behavioral; rather, it is a \"cognitive\" process that takes place in a social context.\nBULLET::::2. Learning can occur by observing a behavior \"and\" by observing the consequences of the behavior (vicarious reinforcement).\nBULLET::::3. Learning involves observation, extraction of information from those observations, and making decisions about the performance of the behavior (observational learning or modeling). Thus, learning can occur without an observable change in behavior.\nBULLET::::4. Reinforcement plays a role in learning but is not entirely responsible for learning.\nBULLET::::5. The learner is not a passive recipient of information. Cognition, environment, and behavior all mutually influence each other (reciprocal determinism).\n\nSocial Learning Theory draws heavily on the concept of modeling as described above. Bandura outlined three types of modeling stimuli:\nBULLET::::1. Live models, where a person is demonstrating the desired behavior\nBULLET::::2. Verbal instruction, in which an individual describes the desired behavior in detail and instructs the participant in how to engage in the behavior\nBULLET::::3. Symbolic, in which modeling occurs by means of the media, including movies, television, Internet, literature, and radio. Stimuli can be either real or fictional characters.\nExactly what information is gleaned from observation is influenced by the type of model, as well as a series of cognitive and behavioral processes, including:\nBULLET::::- Attention \u2013 in order to learn, observers must attend to the modeled behavior. Experimental studies have found that awareness of what is being learned and the mechanisms of reinforcement greatly boosts learning outcomes. Attention is impacted by characteristics of the observer (e.g., perceptual abilities, cognitive abilities, arousal, past performance) and characteristics of the behavior or event (e.g., relevance, novelty, affective valence, and functional value). In this way, social factors contribute to attention \u2013 the prestige of different models affects the relevance and functional value of observation and therefore modulates attention.\nBULLET::::- Retention \u2013 In order to reproduce an observed behavior, observers must be able to remember features of the behavior. Again, this process is influenced by observer characteristics (cognitive capabilities, cognitive rehearsal) and event characteristics (complexity). The cognitive processes underlying retention are described by Bandura as visual and verbal, where verbal descriptions of models are used in more complex scenarios.\nBULLET::::- Reproduction \u2013 By reproduction, Bandura refers not to the propagation of the model but the implementation of it. This requires a degree of cognitive skill, and may in some cases require sensorimotor capabilities. Reproduction can be difficult because in the case of behaviors that are reinforced through self-observation (he cites improvement in sports), it can be difficult to observe behavior well. This can require the input of others to provide self-correcting feedback. Newer studies on feedback support this idea by suggesting effective feedback, which would help with observation and correction improves the performance on participants on tasks.\nBULLET::::- Motivation \u2013 The decision to reproduce (or refrain from reproducing) an observed behavior is dependent on the motivations and expectations of the observer, including anticipated consequences and internal standards. Bandura's description of motivation is also fundamentally based on environmental and thus social factors, since motivational factors are driven by the functional value of different behaviors in a given environment."], "wikipedia-41409857": ["The Social Learning Theory is based on the observing of others and modeling behaviors, emotions and attitude of others. This theory is derived from the concept or perspective of behaviorism but has elements of cognitive learning as well. The theory says that people and especially children learn from observing others and their environment around them. It also says that imitation or modeling has a major role in learning and development of the person and their beliefs or morals. Albert Bandura was a major contributor to the theory of social learning and made many contributions to the field with social experiments and research. The social learning theory says that children learn and develop morals from observing what is around them and having role models that they imitate their behavior and learn from. Role models guide children indirectly with developing morals and morality. By watching the response of others and society around them, children learn what is acceptable and what is not acceptable and try to act similar to what is deemed acceptable by the society around them.\n\nFor example, a child's older brother or sister tends to serve as one of their first role models, especially because they share the same surroundings and authority figures. When the older child misbehaves or does something unacceptable the younger child takes the older one as an example and acts like him or her. However, if the parent punishes the older child or there is a consequence to their behavior, the younger child often does not act like the older one because they were able to observe that that behavior was \u201cunacceptable\u201d by the \u201csociety\u201d surrounding them, meaning their family.

For example, in 2002 researchers used such an approach to teach an AIBO robot basic soccer skills.\n\nSystem models try to mimic the expert by modeling world dynamics.\n\nInverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is the process of deriving a reward function from observed behavior. While ordinary \"reinforcement learning\" involves using rewards and punishments to learn behavior, in IRL the direction is reversed, and a robot observes a person's behavior to figure out what goal that behavior seems to be trying to achieve.

Russell proposes that IRL might be used to observe humans and attempt to codify their complex \"ethical values\", in an effort to create \"ethical robots\" that might someday know \"not to cook your cat\" without needing to be explicitly told. The scenario can be modeled as a \"cooperative inverse reinforcement learning game\", where a \"person\" player and a \"robot\" player cooperate to secure the person's implicit goals, despite these goals not being explicitly known by either the person nor the robot.\n\nIn 2017, OpenAI and DeepMind applied deep learning to the cooperative inverse reinforcement learning in simple domains such as Atari games and straightforward robot tasks such as backflips. The human role was limited to answering queries from the robot as to which of two different actions were preferred. The researchers found evidence that the techniques may be economically scalable to modern systems.\n\nApprenticeship via inverse reinforcement learning (AIRP) was developed by in 2004 Pieter Abbeel, Professor in Berkeley's EECS department, and Andrew Ng, Associate Professor in Stanford University's Computer Science Department. AIRP deals with \"Markov decision process where we are not explicitly given a reward function, but where instead we can observe an expert demonstrating the task that we want to learn to perform\". AIRP has been used to model reward functions of highly dynamic scenarios where there is no obvious reward function intuitively. Take the task of driving for example, there are many different objectives working simultaneously - such as maintaining safe following distance, a good speed, not changing lanes too often, etc. This task, may seem easy at first glance, but a trivial reward function may not converge to the policy wanted.\n\nOne domain where AIRP has been used extensively is helicopter control. While simple trajectories can be intuitively derived, complicated tasks like aerobatics for shows has been successful. These include aerobatic maneuvers like - in-place flips, in-place rolls, loops, hurricanes and even auto-rotation landings. This work was developed by Pieter Abbeel, Adam Coates, and Andrew Ng - \"Autonomous Helicopter Aerobatics through Apprenticeship Learning\"\n\nThe system learns rules to associate preconditions and postconditions with each action.

A child may learn to swear, smack, smoke, and deem other inappropriate behavior acceptable through poor modeling. Albert Bandura claims that children continually learn desirable and undesirable behavior through observational learning. Observational learning suggests that an individual's environment, cognition, and behavior all incorporate and ultimately determine how the individual functions and models.\n\nThrough observational learning, individual behaviors can spread across a culture through a process called \"diffusion chain\". This basically occurs when an individual first learns a behavior by observing another individual and that individual serves as a model through whom other individuals learn the behavior, and so on.\n\nAlbert Bandura states that people\u2019s behavior could be determined by their environment. Observational learning occurs through observing negative and positive behaviors. Bandura believes in reciprocal determinism in which the environment can influence people\u2019s behavior and vice versa. For instance, the Bobo doll experiment shows that model, in a determined environment, affects children\u2019s behavior. In this experiment Bandura demonstrates that one group of children placed in an aggressive environment would act the same way, while the control group and the other group of children placed in a passive role model environment hardly shows any type of aggression.\n\nBandura's social cognitive learning theory states that there are four stages involved in observational learning:\nBULLET::::1.

It is one thing to carefully watch a circus juggler, but it is quite another to go home and repeat those acts.\nBULLET::::4. Motivation: The observer must have motivation to recreate the observed behavior.\n\nBandura clearly distinguishes between learning and performance. Unless motivated, a person does not produce learned behavior. This motivation can come from external reinforcement, such as the experimenter's promise of reward in some of Bandura's studies, or the bribe of a parent. Or it can come from vicarious reinforcement, based on the observation that models are rewarded. High-status models can affect performance through motivation. For example, girls aged 11 to 14 performed better on a motor performance task when they thought it was demonstrated by a high-status cheerleader than by a low-status model.\n\nSome have even added a step between attention and retention involving encoding a behavior.\n\nObservational learning leads to a change in an individual's behavior along three dimensions:\nBULLET::::1. An individual thinks about a situation in a different way and may have incentive to react to it.\nBULLET::::2. The change is a result of a person's direct experiences as opposed to being in-born.\nBULLET::::3. For the most part, the change an individual has made is permanent."], "wikipedia-11026307": ["Mirror neurons are activated both when actions are executed and the actions are observed. This unique function of mirror neurons may explain how people recognize and understand the states of others; mirroring observed action in the brain as if they conducted the observed action.\n\nShared neural representation for a motor behavior and its observation has been extended into the domains of feelings and emotions. Not only movements but also facial expressions activate the same brain regions that are activated by direct experiences. In an fMRI study, same brain regions on action representation found to be activated when people both imitated and observed emotional facial expressions such as happy, sad, angry, surprise, disgust, and afraid.\n\nObserving video clips that displayed facial expression of feeling disgust activated the neural networks typical of direct experience of disgust. Similar results have been found in the case of touch. Watching movies that someone touched legs or faces activated the somatosensory cortex for direct feeling of the touch. A similar mirror system exists in perceiving pain. When people see other people feel pain, people feel pain not only affectively, but also sensorially.\n\nThese results suggest that understanding other's feelings and emotions is driven not by cognitive deduction of what the stimuli means but by automatic activation of somatosensory neurons. A recent study on pupil size directly demonstrated emotion perception was automatic process modulated by mirror systems. When people saw sad faces, pupil sizes influenced viewers in perceiving and judging emotional states without explicit awareness of differences of pupil size. When pupil size was 180% of original size, people perceived a sad face as less negative and less intense than when pupil was smaller than or equal to original pupil size. This mechanism was correlated with brain regions that implicated in emotion process, the amygdala. Furthermore, viewers mimic the size of their own pupils to those of sad faces they watched. Considering that pupil size is beyond voluntary control, the change of pupil size upon emotion judgment is a good indication that understanding emotions is automatic process."], "wikipedia-330102": ["Social learning theory is a theory of learning process and social behavior which proposes that new behaviors can be acquired by observing and imitating others. It states that learning is a cognitive process that takes place in a social context and can occur purely through observation or direct instruction, even in the absence of motor reproduction or direct reinforcement. In addition to the observation of behavior, learning also occurs through the observation of rewards and punishments, a process known as vicarious reinforcement. When a particular behavior is rewarded regularly, it will most likely persist; conversely, if a particular behavior is constantly punished, it will most likely desist. The theory expands on traditional behavioral theories, in which behavior is governed solely by reinforcements, by placing emphasis on the important roles of various internal processes in the learning individual.\n\nSection::::Theory.:Observation and direct experience.\nTypical stimulus-response theories rely entirely upon direct experience (of the stimulus) to inform behavior. Bandura opens up the scope of learning mechanisms by introducing observation as a possibility. He adds to this the ability of modeling \u2013 a means by which humans \"represent actual outcomes symbolically\". These models, cognitively mediated, allow future consequences to have as much of an impact as actual consequences would in a typical S-R theory. An important factor in Social Learning Theory is the concept of reciprocal determinism. This notion states that just as an individual's behavior is influenced by the environment, the environment is also influenced by the individual's behavior. In other words, a person's behavior, environment, and personal qualities all reciprocally influence each other. For example, a child who plays violent video games will likely influence their peers to play as well, which then encourages the child to play more often. This could lead to the child becoming desensitized to violence, which in turn will likely affect the child's real life behaviors.\n\nSection::::Theory.:Modeling and underlying cognitive processes.\nSocial Learning Theory draws heavily on the concept of modeling as described above. Bandura outlined three types of modeling stimuli:\nBULLET::::1. Live models, where a person is demonstrating the desired behavior\nBULLET::::2. Verbal instruction, in which an individual describes the desired behavior in detail and instructs the participant in how to engage in the behavior\nBULLET::::3. Symbolic, in which modeling occurs by means of the media, including movies, television, Internet, literature, and radio. Stimuli can be either real or fictional characters.\nExactly what information is gleaned from observation is influenced by the type of model, as well as a series of cognitive and behavioral processes, including:\nBULLET::::- Attention \u2013 in order to learn, observers must attend to the modeled behavior. Experimental studies have found that awareness of what is being learned and the mechanisms of reinforcement greatly boosts learning outcomes. Attention is impacted by characteristics of the observer (e.g., perceptual abilities, cognitive abilities, arousal, past performance) and characteristics of the behavior or event (e.g., relevance, novelty, affective valence, and functional value). In this way, social factors contribute to attention \u2013 the prestige of different models affects the relevance and functional value of observation and therefore modulates attention.\nBULLET::::- Retention \u2013 In order to reproduce an observed behavior, observers must be able to remember features of the behavior. Again, this process is influenced by observer characteristics (cognitive capabilities, cognitive rehearsal) and event characteristics (complexity). The cognitive processes underlying retention are described by Bandura as visual and verbal, where verbal descriptions of models are used in more complex scenarios.\nBULLET::::- Reproduction \u2013 By reproduction, Bandura refers not to the propagation of the model but the implementation of it. This requires a degree of cognitive skill, and may in some cases require sensorimotor capabilities. Reproduction can be difficult because in the case of behaviors that are reinforced through self-observation (he cites improvement in sports), it can be difficult to observe behavior well. This can require the input of others to provide self-correcting feedback. Newer studies on feedback support this idea by suggesting effective feedback, which would help with observation and correction improves the performance on participants on tasks.\nBULLET::::- Motivation \u2013 The decision to reproduce (or refrain from reproducing) an observed behavior is dependent on the motivations and expectations of the observer, including anticipated consequences and internal standards. Bandura's description of motivation is also fundamentally based on environmental and thus social factors, since motivational factors are driven by the functional value of different behaviors in a given environment."], "wikipedia-1225841": ["The term \"observational learning\" encompasses several closely related concepts: allelomimetic behavior or mimicking where, for example, puppies follow or copy others of their kind; social facilitation where the presence of another dog causes an increase in the intensity of a behavior; and local enhancement which includes pieces of social facilitation, mimicking, and trial-and-error learning, but is different from true observational learning in that the dog actively participates in the behavior in the presence of the other dog and/or other environmental cues. Four necessary conditions for observational learning are: attention, retention, motivation, and production. That is, the dog must pay attention to the dog or person performing the modelled behavior; retain the information gathered about the behavior during the observation; be motivated to reproduce the behavior in a time and place removed from the original; and finally, produce the behavior, or some reasonable facsimile thereof.\nPups between the ages of 9\u201312 weeks who were permitted to observe their narcotics-detecting mothers at work generally proved more capable at learning the same skills at six months of age than control puppies the same age who were not previously allowed to watch their mothers working. A 2001 study recorded the behaviour of dogs in detour tests, in which a favorite toy or food was placed behind a V-shaped fence. The demonstration of the detour by humans significantly improved the dogs' performance in the trials. The experiments showed that dogs are able to rely on information provided by human action when confronted with a new task. Significantly, they did not copy the exact path of the human demonstrator, but adopted the detour behavior shown by humans to reach their goal. A 1977 experiment by Adler and Adler found that puppies who watched other puppies learn to pull a food cart into their cages by an attached ribbon proved considerably faster at the task when later given the opportunity themselves. At 38 days of age, the \"demonstrator\" puppies took an average of 697 seconds to succeed, while the observers succeeded in an average of 9 seconds."], "wikipedia-41409857": ["An example of early moral training is given by Roger Burton. Roger Burton observed his 1-year-old daughter Ursula take her sister's Halloween candy. The older sister quickly scolded the infant for doing so. After a week had passed the infant went and stole candy again but was confronted by her mother this time. Yet again the infant stole her sister's candy, so Burton approached his daughter himself. As Burton was about to say something to Ursula, she spoke and said, \u201cNo this is Maria\u2019s, not Ursula\u2019s.\u201d This specific example given by Burton shows how the infant grows and imputes morality slowly but surely. Over time infants start to understand that their behavior can cause repercussions. The infants learn by observing their surrounding environment. A 1 year old may cease to commit a certain action because of feelings of apprehension due to past experiences of criticism. Both disapproval and reward are key factors in furthering the infants\u2019 development. If a baby is especially close to his mom, her disapproval and reward are that much more impactful in this process than it would be for a baby who was unattached to his mom. Infants are excellent at reading the emotions of others which in turn directs them in knowing what is good and what is bad. A strong attachment between parent and infant is the key to having success with the infants\u2019 socialization. If the relationship between the two is not stable by 15 months, at 4 the child will show animosity and troublesome behavior. At 5 the child is likely to show signs of destructive behavior. In order to ensure this does not happen, a mutually responsive orientation among the parent and offspring is necessary.

For instance, some models of GPI decrease in value when the poverty rate increases. The GPI separates the concept of societal progress from economic growth.\nThe GPI is used in ecological economics, \"green\" economics, sustainability and more inclusive types of economics. It factors in environmental and carbon footprints that businesses produce or eliminate, including in the forms of resource depletion, pollution and long-term environmental damage. GDP is increased twice when pollution is created, since it increases once upon creation (as a side-effect of some valuable process) and again when the pollution is cleaned up; in contrast, GPI counts the initial pollution as a loss rather than a gain, generally equal to the amount it will cost to clean up later plus the cost of any negative impact the pollution will have in the meantime. While quantifying costs and benefits of these environmental and social externalities is a difficult task, \"Earthster-type databases could bring more precision and currency to GPI's metrics.\" It has been noted that such data may also be embraced by those who attempt to \"internalize externalities\" by making companies pay the costs of the pollution they create (rather than having the government or society at large bear those costs) \"by taxing their goods proportionally to their negative ecological and social impacts\".\nGPI is an attempt to measure whether the environmental impact and social costs of economic production and consumption in a country are negative or positive factors in overall health and well-being. By accounting for the costs borne by the society as a whole to repair or control pollution and poverty, GPI balances GDP spending against external costs. GPI advocates claim that it can more reliably measure economic progress, as it distinguishes between the overall \"shift in the 'value basis' of a product, adding its ecological impacts into the equation\". Comparatively speaking, the relationship between GDP and GPI is analogous to the relationship between the gross profit of a company and the net profit; the net profit is the gross profit minus the costs incurred, while the GPI is the GDP (value of all goods and services produced) minus the environmental and social costs. Accordingly, the GPI will be zero if the financial costs of poverty and pollution equal the financial gains in production of goods and services, all other factors being constant.\nAccording to Lawn's model, the \"costs\" of economic activity include the following potential harmful effects:\nBULLET::::- Cost of resource depletion\nBULLET::::- Cost of crime\nBULLET::::- Cost of ozone depletion\nBULLET::::- Cost of family breakdown\nBULLET::::- Cost of air, water, and noise pollution\nBULLET::::- Loss of farmland\nBULLET::::- Loss of wetlands"], "wikipedia-17132856": ["A large and still growing number of attempts to create aggregate measures of various aspects of sustainability created a stable of indices that provide a more nuanced perspective on development than economic aggregates such as GDP.

Parallel to these initiatives, political interest in producing a green GDP that would take at least the cost of pollution and natural capital depletion into account has grown, even if implementation is held back by the reluctance of policymakers and statistical services arising mostly from a concern about conceptual and technical challenges."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Matrix factorization algorithms work by decomposing the user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices. This family of methods became widely known during the Netflix prize challenge due to its effectiveness as reported by Simon Funk in his 2006 blog post, where he shared his findings with the research community.\nThe idea behind matrix factorization is to represent users and items in a lower dimensional latent space . \nSince the initial work by Funk in 2006 a multitude of matrix factorization approaches have been proposed for recommender systems. Some of the most used and simpler ones are listed in the following sections.\nThe original algorithm proposed by Simon Funk in his blog post factorized the user-item rating matrix as the product of two lower dimensional matrices, the first one has a row for each user, while the second has a column for each item. The row or column associated to a specific user or item is referred to as \"latent factors\". Note that, despite its name, in FunkSVD no singular value decomposition is applied.\nThe predicted ratings can be computed as formula_1, where formula_2 is the user-item rating matrix, formula_3 contains the user's latent factors and formula_4 the item's latent factors.\nSpecifically, the predicted rating user \"u\" will give to item \"i\" is computed as:\nformula_5\nIt is possible to tune the expressive power of the model by changing the number of latent factors. It has been demonstrated that a matrix factorization with one latent factor is equivalent to a \"most popular\" or \"top popular\" recommender (e.g. recommends the items with the most interactions without any personalization). Increasing the number of latent factor will improve personalization, therefore recommendation quality, until the number of factors becomes too high, at which point the model starts to overfit and the recommendation quality will decrease. A common strategy to avoid overfitting is to add regularization terms to the objective function.\nFunkSVD was developed as a \"rating prediction\" problem, therefore it uses explicit numerical ratings as user-item interactions.\nAll things considered, FunkSVD minimizes the following objective function:\nformula_6\nWhere formula_7 is defined to be the frobenius norm whereas the other norms might be either frobenius or another norm depending on the specific recommending problem."], "wikipedia-442137": ["In mathematical optimization and decision theory, a loss function or cost function is a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some \"cost\" associated with the event.

An objective function is either a loss function or its negative (in specific domains, variously called a reward function, a profit function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc.), in which case it is to be maximized.\nIn statistics, typically a loss function is used for parameter estimation, and the event in question is some function of the difference between estimated and true values for an instance of data. The concept, as old as Laplace, was reintroduced in statistics by Abraham Wald in the middle of the 20th century. In the context of economics, for example, this is usually economic cost or regret. In classification, it is the penalty for an incorrect classification of an example. In actuarial science, it is used in an insurance context to model benefits paid over premiums, particularly since the works of Harald Cram\u00e9r in the 1920s.

The squared loss function results in an arithmetic mean-unbiased estimator, and the absolute-value loss function results in a median-unbiased estimator (in the one-dimensional case, and a geometric median-unbiased estimator for the multi-dimensional case).

It infers a function from \"\" consisting of a set of \"training examples\". In supervised learning, each example is a \"pair\" consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the \"supervisory signal\"). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a \"reasonable\" way (see inductive bias).\n\nThere are four major issues to consider in supervised learning:\n\nSection::::Algorithm choice.:Bias-variance tradeoff.\nA first issue is the tradeoff between \"bias\" and \"variance\". Imagine that we have available several different, but equally good, training data sets. A learning algorithm is biased for a particular input formula_1 if, when trained on each of these data sets, it is systematically incorrect when predicting the correct output for formula_1. A learning algorithm has high variance for a particular input formula_1 if it predicts different output values when trained on different training sets. The prediction error of a learned classifier is related to the sum of the bias and the variance of the learning algorithm. Generally, there is a tradeoff between bias and variance. A learning algorithm with low bias must be \"flexible\" so that it can fit the data well. But if the learning algorithm is too flexible, it will fit each training data set differently, and hence have high variance. A key aspect of many supervised learning methods is that they are able to adjust this tradeoff between bias and variance (either automatically or by providing a bias/variance parameter that the user can adjust).\n\nSection::::Algorithm choice.:Function complexity and amount of training data.\nThe second issue is the amount of training data available relative to the complexity of the \"true\" function (classifier or regression function). If the true function is simple, then an \"inflexible\" learning algorithm with high bias and low variance will be able to learn it from a small amount of data. But if the true function is highly complex (e.g., because it involves complex interactions among many different input features and behaves differently in different parts of the input space), then the function will only be learn able from a very large amount of training data and using a \"flexible\" learning algorithm with low bias and high variance.\n\nSection::::Algorithm choice.:Dimensionality of the input space.\nA third issue is the dimensionality of the input space. If the input feature vectors have very high dimension, the learning problem can be difficult even if the true function only depends on a small number of those features. This is because the many \"extra\" dimensions can confuse the learning algorithm and cause it to have high variance. Hence, high input dimensional typically requires tuning the classifier to have low variance and high bias. In practice, if the engineer can manually remove irrelevant features from the input data, this is likely to improve the accuracy of the learned function. In addition, there are many algorithms for feature selection that seek to identify the relevant features and discard the irrelevant ones. This is an instance of the more general strategy of dimensionality reduction, which seeks to map the input data into a lower-dimensional space prior to running the supervised learning algorithm.\n\nSection::::Algorithm choice.:Noise in the output values.\nA fourth issue is the degree of noise in the desired output values (the supervisory target variables). If the desired output values are often incorrect (because of human error or sensor errors), then the learning algorithm should not attempt to find a function that exactly matches the training examples. Attempting to fit the data too carefully leads to overfitting. You can overfit even when there are no measurement errors (stochastic noise) if the function you are trying to learn is too complex for your learning model. In such a situation, the part of the target function that cannot be modeled \"corrupts\" your training data - this phenomenon has been called deterministic noise. When either type of noise is present, it is better to go with a higher bias, lower variance estimator.\n\nIn practice, there are several approaches to alleviate noise in the output values such as early stopping to prevent overfitting as well as detecting and removing the noisy training examples prior to training the supervised learning algorithm. There are several algorithms that identify noisy training examples and removing the suspected noisy training examples prior to training has decreased generalization error with statistical significance."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

If the input feature vectors have very high dimension, the learning problem can be difficult even if the true function only depends on a small number of those features. This is because the many \"extra\" dimensions can confuse the learning algorithm and cause it to have high variance. Hence, high input dimensional typically requires tuning the classifier to have low variance and high bias. In practice, if the engineer can manually remove irrelevant features from the input data, this is likely to improve the accuracy of the learned function. In addition, there are many algorithms for feature selection that seek to identify the relevant features and discard the irrelevant ones. This is an instance of the more general strategy of dimensionality reduction, which seeks to map the input data into a lower-dimensional space prior to running the supervised learning algorithm.\n\nSection::::Algorithm choice.:Noise in the output values.\nA fourth issue is the degree of noise in the desired output values (the supervisory target variables). If the desired output values are often incorrect (because of human error or sensor errors), then the learning algorithm should not attempt to find a function that exactly matches the training examples. Attempting to fit the data too carefully leads to overfitting. You can overfit even when there are no measurement errors (stochastic noise) if the function you are trying to learn is too complex for your learning model. In such a situation, the part of the target function that cannot be modeled \"corrupts\" your training data - this phenomenon has been called deterministic noise. When either type of noise is present, it is better to go with a higher bias, lower variance estimator.\n\nIn practice, there are several approaches to alleviate noise in the output values such as early stopping to prevent overfitting as well as detecting and removing the noisy training examples prior to training the supervised learning algorithm. There are several algorithms that identify noisy training examples and removing the suspected noisy training examples prior to training has decreased generalization error with statistical significance."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

By performing an action formula_1, the agent transitions from state to state. Executing an action in a specific state provides the agent with a \"reward\" (a numerical score). \nThe goal of the agent is to maximize its total (future) reward. It does this by adding the maximum reward attainable from future states to the reward for achieving its current state, effectively influencing the current action by the potential future reward. This potential reward is a weighted sum of the expected values of the rewards of all future steps starting from the current state. \nAs an example, consider the process of boarding a train, in which the reward is measured by the negative of the total time spent boarding (alternatively, the cost of boarding the train is equal to the boarding time). One strategy is to enter the train door as soon as they open, minimizing the initial wait time for yourself. If the train is crowded, however, then you will have a slow entry after the initial action of entering the door as people are fighting you to depart the train as you attempt to board. The total boarding time, or cost, is then:\nBULLET::::- 0 seconds wait time + 15 seconds fight time\nOn the next day, by random chance (exploration), you decide to wait and let other people depart first. This initially results in a longer wait time. However, time fighting other passengers is less.

Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\nIt differs from supervised learning in that labelled input/output pairs need not be presented, and sub-optimal actions need not be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).\nThe environment is typically formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), as many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context utilize dynamic programming techniques. The main difference between the classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible.\nA reinforcement learning agent interacts with its environment in discrete time steps. At each time , the agent receives an observation formula_9, which typically includes the reward formula_10. It then chooses an action formula_11 from the set of available actions, which is subsequently sent to the environment. The environment moves to a new state formula_12 and the reward formula_13 associated with the 'transition' formula_14 is determined. The goal of a reinforcement learning agent is to collect as much reward as possible. The agent can (possibly randomly) choose any action as a function of the history.\nWhen the agent's performance is compared to that of an agent that acts optimally, the difference in performance gives rise to the notion of 'regret'. In order to act near optimally, the agent must reason about the long term consequences of its actions (i.e., maximize future income), although the immediate reward associated with this might be negative.\nThus, reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited to problems that include a long-term versus short-term reward trade-off. It has been applied successfully to various problems, including robot control, elevator scheduling, telecommunications, backgammon, checkers and go (AlphaGo).\nTwo elements make reinforcement learning powerful: the use of samples to optimize performance and the use of function approximation to deal with large environments.

Unlike classical control and classification problems, the solutions are complex and must be discovered and optimized in multidimensional space. Planning is also related to decision theory.\nIn known environments with available models, planning can be done offline. Solutions can be found and evaluated prior to execution. In dynamically unknown environments, the strategy often needs to be revised online. Models and policies must be adapted. Solutions usually resort to iterative trial and error processes commonly seen in artificial intelligence. These include dynamic programming, reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimization.

(For example, formula_42 when the discount rate is r.) formula_43 is typically close to 1.\nBecause of the Markov property, the optimal policy for this particular problem can indeed be written as a function of formula_1 only, as assumed above.\nThe discount factor is used so that the decision maker favours taking actions early and doesn't postpone them indefinitely.\nSection::::Algorithms.\nThe solution for an MDP is a policy which describes the best action for each state in the MDP, known as the optimal policy. This optimal policy can be found through a variety of methods, like dynamic programming.\nSome dynamic programming solutions require knowledge of the state transition function formula_45 and the reward function formula_46. Others can solve for the optimal policy of an MDP using experimentation alone.\nConsider the case in which state transition function formula_45 and reward function formula_46 for an MDP are given, and we seek the optimal policy formula_49 that maximizes the expected discounted reward.\nThe standard family of algorithms to calculate this optimal policy requires storage for two arrays indexed by state: \"value\" formula_50, which contains real values, and \"policy\" formula_30, which contains actions. At the end of the algorithm, formula_30 will contain the solution and formula_53 will contain the discounted sum of the rewards to be earned (on average) by following that solution from state formula_1.\nThe algorithm has two steps, (1) a value update and (2) a policy update, which are repeated in some order for all the states until no further changes take place. Both recursively update \na new estimation of the optimal policy and state value using an older estimation of those values.\nTheir order depends on the variant of the algorithm; one can also do them for all states at once or state by state, and more often to some states than others.

The main difference between the classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible.\nReinforcement learning, due to its generality, is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms. In the operations research and control literature, reinforcement learning is called \"approximate dynamic programming,\" or \"neuro-dynamic programming.\"\nThus, reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited to problems that include a long-term versus short-term reward trade-off. It has been applied successfully to various problems, including robot control, elevator scheduling, telecommunications, backgammon, checkers and go (AlphaGo).\nTwo elements make reinforcement learning powerful: the use of samples to optimize performance and the use of function approximation to deal with large environments. Thanks to these two key components, reinforcement learning can be used in large environments in the following situations:\nBULLET::::- A model of the environment is known, but an analytic solution is not available;\nBULLET::::- Only a simulation model of the environment is given (the subject of simulation-based optimization);\nBULLET::::- The only way to collect information about the environment is to interact with it."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. **Yes**\n\n2. arXiv hosts numerous papers that provide foundational knowledge on reinforcement learning (RL) and its application to various domains, including recommender systems.

Higher patient satisfaction have been associated with less emergency department use but with greater inpatient use, higher overall health care and prescription drug expenditures, and increased mortality.

RNN can be used as general sequence processors.\nSection::::Recurrent neural network.:Fully recurrent.\nThis architecture was developed in the 1980s. Its network creates a directed connection between every pair of units. Each has a time-varying, real-valued (more than just zero or one) activation (output). Each connection has a modifiable real-valued weight. Some of the nodes are called labeled nodes, some output nodes, the rest hidden nodes.\nFor supervised learning in discrete time settings, training sequences of real-valued input vectors become sequences of activations of the input nodes, one input vector at a time. At each time step, each non-input unit computes its current activation as a nonlinear function of the weighted sum of the activations of all units from which it receives connections. The system can explicitly activate (independent of incoming signals) some output units at certain time steps. For example, if the input sequence is a speech signal corresponding to a spoken digit, the final target output at the end of the sequence may be a label classifying the digit. For each sequence, its error is the sum of the deviations of all activations computed by the network from the corresponding target signals. For a training set of numerous sequences, the total error is the sum of the errors of all individual sequences.\nTo minimize total error, gradient descent can be used to change each weight in proportion to its derivative with respect to the error, provided the non-linear activation functions are differentiable. The standard method is called \"backpropagation through time\" or BPTT, a generalization of back-propagation for feedforward networks. A more computationally expensive online variant is called \"Real-Time Recurrent Learning\" or RTRL. Unlike BPTT this algorithm is \"local in time but not local in space\". An online hybrid between BPTT and RTRL with intermediate complexity exists, with variants for continuous time. A major problem with gradient descent for standard RNN architectures is that error gradients vanish exponentially quickly with the size of the time lag between important events. The Long short-term memory architecture overcomes these problems.\nIn reinforcement learning settings, no teacher provides target signals. Instead a fitness function or reward function or utility function is occasionally used to evaluate performance, which influences its input stream through output units connected to actuators that affect the environment. Variants of evolutionary computation are often used to optimize the weight matrix."], "wikipedia-10711453": ["Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning.

Its main job is to identify the objects that will participate in the use case and to assign them to play the Roles which carry out the use case through their responsibilities. A Role may comprise methods, and each method is some small part of the logic of an algorithm implementing a use case. Role methods run in the context of an object that is selected by the context to play that Role for the current use case enactment. The Role-to-object bindings that take place in a context can be contrasted with the polymorphism of vernacular object-oriented programming. The overall business functionality is the sum of complex, dynamic networks of methods decentralized in multiple contexts and their Roles.\nEach context is a scope that includes identifiers that correspond to its Roles. Any Role executing within that context can refer to the other Roles in that context through these identifiers. These identifiers have come to be called \"methodless Roles\". At use case enactment time, each and every one of these identifiers becomes bound to an object playing the corresponding Role for this context.\nAn example of a context could be a wire transfer between two accounts, where data models (the banking accounts) are used through Roles named SourceAccount and DestinationAccount."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Yes  \n2. Wikipedia contains information on various reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks, Policy Gradient methods) and often discusses the challenges these algorithms aim to address, such as exploration-exploitation trade-offs, instability in training, or sample inefficiency. While Wikipedia may not provide exhaustive or cutting-edge details, it can offer foundational knowledge relevant to the query.", "wikipedia-66294": ["Assuming full knowledge of the MDP, the two basic approaches to compute the optimal action-value function are value iteration and policy iteration. Both algorithms compute a sequence of functions formula_60 (formula_61) that converge to formula_59. Computing these functions involves computing expectations over the whole state-space, which is impractical for all but the smallest (finite) MDPs. In reinforcement learning methods, expectations are approximated by averaging over samples and using function approximation techniques to cope with the need to represent value functions over large state-action spaces.\n\nMonte Carlo methods can be used in an algorithm that mimics policy iteration. Policy iteration consists of two steps: \"policy evaluation\" and \"policy improvement\".\n\nProblems with this procedure include:\nBULLET::::- The procedure may spend too much time evaluating a suboptimal policy.\nBULLET::::- It uses samples inefficiently in that a long trajectory improves the estimate only of the \"single\" state-action pair that started the trajectory.\nBULLET::::- When the returns along the trajectories have \"high variance\", convergence is slow.\nBULLET::::- It works in episodic problems only;\nBULLET::::- It works in small, finite MDPs only.\n\nThe first problem is corrected by allowing the procedure to change the policy (at some or all states) before the values settle. This too may be problematic as it might prevent convergence. Most current algorithms do this, giving rise to the class of \"generalized policy iteration\" algorithms. Many \"actor critic\" methods belong to this category.\n\nA better solution when returns have high variance is Sutton's temporal difference (TD) methods that are based on the recursive Bellman equation. Note that the computation in TD methods can be incremental (when after each transition the memory is changed and the transition is thrown away), or batch (when the transitions are batched and the estimates are computed once based on the batch). Batch methods, such as the least-squares temporal difference method, may use the information in the samples better, while incremental methods are the only choice when batch methods are infeasible due to their high computational or memory complexity. Some methods try to combine the two approaches. Methods based on temporal differences also overcome the fourth issue.\n\nValue iteration can also be used as a starting point, giving rise to the Q-learning algorithm and its many variants.\n\nAn alternative method is to search directly in (some subset of) the policy space, in which case the problem becomes a case of stochastic optimization. The two approaches available are gradient-based and gradient-free methods.\n\nGradient-based methods (\"policy gradient methods\") start with a mapping from a finite-dimensional (parameter) space to the space of policies: given the parameter vector formula_76, let formula_81 denote the policy associated to formula_76. Defining the performance function by\nunder mild conditions this function will be differentiable as a function of the parameter vector formula_76. If the gradient of formula_85 was known, one could use gradient ascent. Since an analytic expression for the gradient is not available, only a noisy estimate is available. Such an estimate can be constructed in many ways, giving rise to algorithms such as Williams' REINFORCE method (which is known as the likelihood ratio method in the simulation-based optimization literature). Policy search methods have been used in the robotics context. Many policy search methods may get stuck in local optima (as they are based on local search).\n\nA large class of methods avoids relying on gradient information. These include simulated annealing, cross-entropy search or methods of evolutionary computation. Many gradient-free methods can achieve (in theory and in the limit) a global optimum.\n\nPolicy search methods may converge slowly given noisy data. For example, this happens in episodic problems when the trajectories are long and the variance of the returns is large. Value-function based methods that rely on temporal differences might help in this case. In recent years, \"actor\u2013critic methods\" have been proposed and performed well on various problems."], "wikipedia-1281850": ["In 2014 Google DeepMind patented an application of Q-learning to deep learning, titled \"deep reinforcement learning\" or \"deep Q-learning\" that can play Atari 2600 games at expert human levels.\nThe DeepMind system used a deep convolutional neural network, with layers of tiled convolutional filters to mimic the effects of receptive fields. Reinforcement learning is unstable or divergent when a nonlinear function approximator such as a neural network is used to represent Q. This instability comes from the correlations present in the sequence of observations, the fact that small updates to Q may significantly change the policy and the data distribution, and the correlations between Q and the target values. \nThe technique used \"experience replay,\" a biologically inspired mechanism that uses a random sample of prior actions instead of the most recent action to proceed. This removes correlations in the observation sequence and smooths changes in the data distribution. Iterative update adjusts Q towards target values that are only periodically updated, further reducing correlations with the target.\nBecause the future maximum approximated action value in Q-learning is evaluated using the same Q function as in current action selection policy, in noisy environments Q-learning can sometimes overestimate the action values, slowing the learning. A variant called Double Q-learning was proposed to correct this. Double Q-learning is an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm, where a different policy is used for value evaluation than what is used to select the next action.\nIn practice, two separate value functions are trained in a mutually symmetric fashion using separate experiences, formula_33 and formula_34. The double Q-learning update step is then as follows:\nNow the estimated value of the discounted future is evaluated using a different policy, which solves the overestimation issue.\nThis algorithm was later combined with deep learning, as in the DQN algorithm, resulting in Double DQN, which outperforms the original DQN algorithm.\nDelayed Q-learning is an alternative implementation of the online \"Q\"-learning algorithm, with probably approximately correct (PAC) learning.\nGreedy GQ is a variant of \"Q\"-learning to use in combination with (linear) function approximation.

It also covers challenges like exploration-exploitation trade-offs, credit assignment, and scalability, which these algorithms aim to address. While the depth may vary, the content is sufficient for a foundational understanding.", "wikipedia-66294": ["Assuming full knowledge of the MDP, the two basic approaches to compute the optimal action-value function are value iteration and policy iteration. Both algorithms compute a sequence of functions formula_60 (formula_61) that converge to formula_59. Computing these functions involves computing expectations over the whole state-space, which is impractical for all but the smallest (finite) MDPs. In reinforcement learning methods, expectations are approximated by averaging over samples and using function approximation techniques to cope with the need to represent value functions over large state-action spaces.\n\nSection::::Algorithms for control learning.:Value function.:Monte Carlo methods.\nMonte Carlo methods can be used in an algorithm that mimics policy iteration. Policy iteration consists of two steps: \"policy evaluation\" and \"policy improvement\".\nMonte Carlo is used in the policy evaluation step. In this step, given a stationary, deterministic policy formula_25, the goal is to compute the function values formula_64 (or a good approximation to them) for all state-action pairs formula_48. Assuming (for simplicity) that the MDP is finite, that sufficient memory is available to accommodate the action-values and that the problem is episodic and after each episode a new one starts from some random initial state. Then, the estimate of the value of a given state-action pair formula_48 can be computed by averaging the sampled returns that originated from formula_48 over time. Given sufficient time, this procedure can thus construct a precise estimate formula_68 of the action-value function formula_69. This finishes the description of the policy evaluation step.\nIn the policy improvement step, the next policy is obtained by computing a \"greedy\" policy with respect to formula_68: Given a state formula_2, this new policy returns an action that maximizes formula_72. In practice lazy evaluation can defer the computation of the maximizing actions to when they are needed.\nProblems with this procedure include:\nBULLET::::- The procedure may spend too much time evaluating a suboptimal policy.\nBULLET::::- It uses samples inefficiently in that a long trajectory improves the estimate only of the \"single\" state-action pair that started the trajectory.\nBULLET::::- When the returns along the trajectories have \"high variance\", convergence is slow.\nBULLET::::- It works in episodic problems only;\nBULLET::::- It works in small, finite MDPs only.\nSection::::Algorithms for control learning.:Value function.:Temporal difference methods.\nThe first problem is corrected by allowing the procedure to change the policy (at some or all states) before the values settle. This too may be problematic as it might prevent convergence. Most current algorithms do this, giving rise to the class of \"generalized policy iteration\" algorithms. Many \"actor critic\" methods belong to this category.\nThe second issue can be corrected by allowing trajectories to contribute to any state-action pair in them. This may also help to some extent with the third problem, although a better solution when returns have high variance is Sutton's temporal difference (TD) methods that are based on the recursive Bellman equation. Note that the computation in TD methods can be incremental (when after each transition the memory is changed and the transition is thrown away), or batch (when the transitions are batched and the estimates are computed once based on the batch). Batch methods, such as the least-squares temporal difference method, may use the information in the samples better, while incremental methods are the only choice when batch methods are infeasible due to their high computational or memory complexity. Some methods try to combine the two approaches. Methods based on temporal differences also overcome the fourth issue.\nIn order to address the fifth issue, \"function approximation methods\" are used. \"Linear function approximation\" starts with a mapping formula_73 that assigns a finite-dimensional vector to each state-action pair. Then, the action values of a state-action pair formula_48 are obtained by linearly combining the components of formula_75 with some \"weights\" formula_76:\nThe algorithms then adjust the weights, instead of adjusting the values associated with the individual state-action pairs. Methods based on ideas from nonparametric statistics (which can be seen to construct their own features) have been explored.\nValue iteration can also be used as a starting point, giving rise to the Q-learning algorithm and its many variants. \nThe problem with using action-values is that they may need highly precise estimates of the competing action values that can be hard to obtain when the returns are noisy. Though this problem is mitigated to some extent by temporal difference methods. Using the so-called compatible function approximation method compromises generality and efficiency. Another problem specific to TD comes from their reliance on the recursive Bellman equation. Most TD methods have a so-called formula_78 parameter formula_79 that can continuously interpolate between Monte Carlo methods that do not rely on the Bellman equations and the basic TD methods that rely entirely on the Bellman equations. This can be effective in palliating this issue.\nSection::::Algorithms for control learning.:Direct policy search.\nAn alternative method is to search directly in (some subset of) the policy space, in which case the problem becomes a case of stochastic optimization. The two approaches available are gradient-based and gradient-free methods.\nGradient-based methods (\"policy gradient methods\") start with a mapping from a finite-dimensional (parameter) space to the space of policies: given the parameter vector formula_76, let formula_81 denote the policy associated to formula_76. Defining the performance function by\nunder mild conditions this function will be differentiable as a function of the parameter vector formula_76. If the gradient of formula_85 was known, one could use gradient ascent. Since an analytic expression for the gradient is not available, only a noisy estimate is available. Such an estimate can be constructed in many ways, giving rise to algorithms such as Williams' REINFORCE method (which is known as the likelihood ratio method in the simulation-based optimization literature). Policy search methods have been used in the robotics context. Many policy search methods may get stuck in local optima (as they are based on local search).\nA large class of methods avoids relying on gradient information. These include simulated annealing, cross-entropy search or methods of evolutionary computation. Many gradient-free methods can achieve (in theory and in the limit) a global optimum.\nPolicy search methods may converge slowly given noisy data. For example, this happens in episodic problems when the trajectories are long and the variance of the returns is large. Value-function based methods that rely on temporal differences might help in this case. In recent years, \"actor\u2013critic methods\" have been proposed and performed well on various problems."], "wikipedia-1281850": ["\"Q\"-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. The goal of Q-learning is to learn a policy, which tells an agent what action to take under what circumstances. It does not require a model (hence the connotation \"model-free\") of the environment, and it can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards, without requiring adaptations.\nFor any finite Markov decision process (FMDP), \"Q\"-learning finds a policy that is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the expected value of the total reward over any and all successive steps, starting from the current state. \"Q\"-learning can identify an optimal action-selection policy for any given FMDP, given infinite exploration time and a partly-random policy. \"Q\" names the function that returns the reward used to provide the reinforcement and can be said to stand for the \"quality\" of an action taken in a given state."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Variables:  \n   - \u03c4(a|s): Policy (action probability).  \n   - Q(s,a): Value of action (a) in state (s).  \n   - softmax: Normalizes Q-values into probabilities.  \n\nRelevant explanations can likely be found in arXiv papers on reinforcement learning, though excluding the original study's work."}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-6152185": 1, "wikipedia-24133": 1, "wikipedia-2940971": 1, "wikipedia-34283581": 1, "wikipedia-17528854": 1, "wikipedia-36406667": 1, "wikipedia-35138969": 1, "wikipedia-6620973": 1, "wikipedia-645602": 1, "wikipedia-58552301": 1, "arxiv-2001.01987": 1, "arxiv-nucl-th/0501063": 1, "arxiv-1910.02394": 1, "arxiv-2304.10411": 1, "arxiv-2104.00069": 1, "arxiv-1012.5297": 1, "arxiv-1805.10791": 1, "arxiv-2308.15369": 1, "arxiv-2303.08900": 1, "arxiv-1812.00001": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-6152185": 1, "wikipedia-24133": 1, "wikipedia-2940971": 1, "wikipedia-34283581": 1, "wikipedia-17528854": 1, "wikipedia-36406667": 1, "wikipedia-35138969": 1, "wikipedia-6620973": 1, "wikipedia-645602": 1, "wikipedia-58552301": 1, "arxiv-2001.01987": 1, "arxiv-nucl-th/0501063": 1, "arxiv-1910.02394": 1, "arxiv-2304.10411": 1, "arxiv-2104.00069": 1, "arxiv-1012.5297": 1, "arxiv-1805.10791": 1, "arxiv-2308.15369": 1, "arxiv-2303.08900": 1, "arxiv-1812.00001": 1}}}

Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\nIt differs from supervised learning in that labelled input/output pairs need not be presented, and sub-optimal actions need not be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).\nThe environment is typically formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), as many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context utilize dynamic programming techniques. The main difference between the classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible.\nThus, reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited to problems that include a long-term versus short-term reward trade-off. It has been applied successfully to various problems, including robot control, elevator scheduling, telecommunications, backgammon, checkers and go (AlphaGo).\nTwo elements make reinforcement learning powerful: the use of samples to optimize performance and the use of function approximation to deal with large environments. Thanks to these two key components, reinforcement learning can be used in large environments in the following situations:\nBULLET::::- A model of the environment is known, but an analytic solution is not available;\nBULLET::::- Only a simulation model of the environment is given (the subject of simulation-based optimization);\nBULLET::::- The only way to collect information about the environment is to interact with it."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Both algorithms compute a sequence of functions formula_60 (formula_61) that converge to formula_59. Computing these functions involves computing expectations over the whole state-space, which is impractical for all but the smallest (finite) MDPs. In reinforcement learning methods, expectations are approximated by averaging over samples and using function approximation techniques to cope with the need to represent value functions over large state-action spaces.\nMonte Carlo methods can be used in an algorithm that mimics policy iteration. Policy iteration consists of two steps: \"policy evaluation\" and \"policy improvement\". ... Problems with this procedure include: BULLET::::- The procedure may spend too much time evaluating a suboptimal policy. BULLET::::- It uses samples inefficiently in that a long trajectory improves the estimate only of the \"single\" state-action pair that started the trajectory. BULLET::::- When the returns along the trajectories have \"high variance\", convergence is slow. BULLET::::- It works in episodic problems only; BULLET::::- It works in small, finite MDPs only.\nThe first problem is corrected by allowing the procedure to change the policy (at some or all states) before the values settle. This too may be problematic as it might prevent convergence. Most current algorithms do this, giving rise to the class of \"generalized policy iteration\" algorithms. Many \"actor critic\" methods belong to this category.\n... A better solution when returns have high variance is Sutton's temporal difference (TD) methods that are based on the recursive Bellman equation. Note that the computation in TD methods can be incremental ... or batch. Batch methods, such as the least-squares temporal difference method, may use the information in the samples better, while incremental methods are the only choice when batch methods are infeasible due to their high computational or memory complexity. Some methods try to combine the two approaches. Methods based on temporal differences also overcome the fourth issue.\nIn order to address the fifth issue, \"function approximation methods\" are used. \"Linear function approximation\" starts with a mapping formula_73 that assigns a finite-dimensional vector to each state-action pair. Then, the action values of a state-action pair formula_48 are obtained by linearly combining the components of formula_75 with some \"weights\" formula_76:\nValue iteration can also be used as a starting point, giving rise to the Q-learning algorithm and its many variants.\n... Gradient-based methods (\"policy gradient methods\") start with a mapping from a finite-dimensional (parameter) space to the space of policies: ... Policy search methods have been used in the robotics context. Many policy search methods may get stuck in local optima (as they are based on local search).\nA large class of methods avoids relying on gradient information. These include simulated annealing, cross-entropy search or methods of evolutionary computation. Many gradient-free methods can achieve (in theory and in the limit) a global optimum.\n... For incremental algorithms, asymptotic convergence issues have been settled. Temporal-difference-based algorithms converge under a wider set of conditions than was previously possible (for example, when used with arbitrary, smooth function approximation).\nMultiagent or distributed reinforcement learning is a topic of interest. Applications are expanding.\nBULLET::::- Actor-critic reinforcement learning"], "wikipedia-52003586": ["Shibata began working with this framework in 1997.

In reinforcement learning methods, expectations are approximated by averaging over samples and using function approximation techniques to cope with the need to represent value functions over large state-action spaces.\nSection::::Algorithms for control learning.:Value function.:Monte Carlo methods.\nMonte Carlo methods can be used in an algorithm that mimics policy iteration. Policy iteration consists of two steps: \"policy evaluation\" and \"policy improvement\".\nMonte Carlo is used in the policy evaluation step. In this step, given a stationary, deterministic policy formula_25, the goal is to compute the function values formula_64 (or a good approximation to them) for all state-action pairs formula_48. Assuming (for simplicity) that the MDP is finite, that sufficient memory is available to accommodate the action-values and that the problem is episodic and after each episode a new one starts from some random initial state. Then, the estimate of the value of a given state-action pair formula_48 can be computed by averaging the sampled returns that originated from formula_48 over time. Given sufficient time, this procedure can thus construct a precise estimate formula_68 of the action-value function formula_69. This finishes the description of the policy evaluation step.\nIn the policy improvement step, the next policy is obtained by computing a \"greedy\" policy with respect to formula_68: Given a state formula_2, this new policy returns an action that maximizes formula_72. In practice lazy evaluation can defer the computation of the maximizing actions to when they are needed.\nProblems with this procedure include:\nBULLET::::- The procedure may spend too much time evaluating a suboptimal policy.\nBULLET::::- It uses samples inefficiently in that a long trajectory improves the estimate only of the \"single\" state-action pair that started the trajectory.\nBULLET::::- When the returns along the trajectories have \"high variance\", convergence is slow.\nBULLET::::- It works in episodic problems only;\nBULLET::::- It works in small, finite MDPs only.\nSection::::Algorithms for control learning.:Value function.:Temporal difference methods.\nThe first problem is corrected by allowing the procedure to change the policy (at some or all states) before the values settle. This too may be problematic as it might prevent convergence. Most current algorithms do this, giving rise to the class of \"generalized policy iteration\" algorithms. Many \"actor critic\" methods belong to this category.\nThe second issue can be corrected by allowing trajectories to contribute to any state-action pair in them. This may also help to some extent with the third problem, although a better solution when returns have high variance is Sutton's temporal difference (TD) methods that are based on the recursive Bellman equation. Note that the computation in TD methods can be incremental (when after each transition the memory is changed and the transition is thrown away), or batch (when the transitions are batched and the estimates are computed once based on the batch). Batch methods, such as the least-squares temporal difference method, may use the information in the samples better, while incremental methods are the only choice when batch methods are infeasible due to their high computational or memory complexity. Some methods try to combine the two approaches. Methods based on temporal differences also overcome the fourth issue.\nIn order to address the fifth issue, \"function approximation methods\" are used. \"Linear function approximation\" starts with a mapping formula_73 that assigns a finite-dimensional vector to each state-action pair. Then, the action values of a state-action pair formula_48 are obtained by linearly combining the components of formula_75 with some \"weights\" formula_76:\nThe algorithms then adjust the weights, instead of adjusting the values associated with the individual state-action pairs. Methods based on ideas from nonparametric statistics (which can be seen to construct their own features) have been explored.\nValue iteration can also be used as a starting point, giving rise to the Q-learning algorithm and its many variants. \nThe problem with using action-values is that they may need highly precise estimates of the competing action values that can be hard to obtain when the returns are noisy. Though this problem is mitigated to some extent by temporal difference methods. Using the so-called compatible function approximation method compromises generality and efficiency. Another problem specific to TD comes from their reliance on the recursive Bellman equation. Most TD methods have a so-called formula_78 parameter formula_79 that can continuously interpolate between Monte Carlo methods that do not rely on the Bellman equations and the basic TD methods that rely entirely on the Bellman equations. This can be effective in palliating this issue.\nSection::::Algorithms for control learning.:Direct policy search.\nAn alternative method is to search directly in (some subset of) the policy space, in which case the problem becomes a case of stochastic optimization. The two approaches available are gradient-based and gradient-free methods.\nGradient-based methods (\"policy gradient methods\") start with a mapping from a finite-dimensional (parameter) space to the space of policies: given the parameter vector formula_76, let formula_81 denote the policy associated to formula_76. Defining the performance function by\nunder mild conditions this function will be differentiable as a function of the parameter vector formula_76. If the gradient of formula_85 was known, one could use gradient ascent. Since an analytic expression for the gradient is not available, only a noisy estimate is available. Such an estimate can be constructed in many ways, giving rise to algorithms such as Williams' REINFORCE method (which is known as the likelihood ratio method in the simulation-based optimization literature). Policy search methods have been used in the robotics context. Many policy search methods may get stuck in local optima (as they are based on local search).\nA large class of methods avoids relying on gradient information. These include simulated annealing, cross-entropy search or methods of evolutionary computation. Many gradient-free methods can achieve (in theory and in the limit) a global optimum.\nPolicy search methods may converge slowly given noisy data. For example, this happens in episodic problems when the trajectories are long and the variance of the returns is large. Value-function based methods that rely on temporal differences might help in this case. In recent years, \"actor\u2013critic methods\" have been proposed and performed well on various problems."], "wikipedia-40149914": ["Dopamine is proposed to act as a \"global learning\" signal, critical to prediction of rewards and action reinforcement. In this way, dopamine is involved in a learning algorithm in which Actor, Environment and Critic are bound in a dynamic interplay that ultimately seeks to maximise the sum of future rewards by producing an optimal action selection policy. In this context, Critic and Actor are characterised as independent network edges that also form a single Complex Agent. This Agent collectively influences the information state of the Environment, which is fed back to the Agent for future computations. Through a separate pathway, Environment is also fed back to Critic in the form of the reward gained though the given action, meaning an equilibrium can be reached between the predicted reward of given policy for a given state, and the evolving prospect of future rewards.\n\nSerotonin is proposed to control the balance between short and long term reward prediction, essentially by variably \"discounting\" expected future reward sums that may require too much expenditure to achieve. In this way, serotonin may facilitate the expectation of reward at a quasi-emotional level, and thus either encourage or discourage persistence in reward-seeking behaviour depending on the demand of the task, and the duration of persistence required. As global reward prediction would theoretically result from Serotonin modulated computations reaching a steady state with the computations similarly modulated by Dopamine; high serotonergic signalling may override the computations of Dopamine and produce a divergent paradigm of reward not mathematically viable through the dopamine modulated computations alone.\n\nNorepinephrine is proposed to facilitate \"wide exploration\" by stochastic action selection. The choice between focusing on known, effective strategies or selecting new, experimental ones is known in probability theory as the Exploration-Exploitation Problem. An interplay between situational urgency, and the effectiveness of known strategies thus influences the dilemma between reliable selection for the largest predicted reward, and exploratory selection outside known parameters. Since neuronal firing cascades (such as those required to perfectly swing a golf club) are by definition unstable and prone to variation; Norepinephrine thus selects for the most reliable known execution pattern at higher levels, and allows for more random and unreliable selection at low levels with the purpose of potentially discovering more efficient strategies in the process."], "wikipedia-52003586": ["In end-to-end reinforcement learning, the end-to-end process, in other words, the entire process from sensors to motors in a robot or agent involves a single, layered or recurrent neural network without modularization, and is trained by reinforcement learning (RL). The approach has been proposed for a long time, but was reenergized by the successful results in learning to play Atari video games (2013\u201315) and AlphaGo (2016) by Google DeepMind.\nRL traditionally required explicit design of state space and action space, while the mapping from state space to action space is learned. Therefore, RL has been limited to learning only for action, and human designers have to design how to construct state space from sensor signals and to give how the motion commands are generated for each action before learning. Neural networks have been often used in RL, to provide non-linear function approximation to avoid the curse of dimensionality. Recurrent neural networks have been also employed, mainly to avoid perceptual aliasing or partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).\nEnd-to-end RL extends RL from learning only for actions to learning the entire process from sensors to motors including higher-level functions that are difficult to develop independently from other functions. Higher-level functions do not connect directly with either sensors or motors, and so even giving their inputs and outputs is difficult.\nShibata began working with this framework in 1997. They employed Q-learning and actor-critic for continuous motion tasks, and used a recurrent neural network for memory-required tasks. They applied this framework to some real robot tasks. They demonstrated learning of various functions.\nBeginning around 2013, Google DeepMind showed impressive learning results in video games and game of Go (AlphaGo). They used a deep convolutional neural network that showed superior results in image recognition. They used 4 frames of almost raw RGB pixels (84x84) as inputs. The network was trained based on RL with the reward representing the sign of the change in the game score. All 49 games were learned using the same network architecture and Q-learning with minimal prior knowledge, and outperformed competing methods on almost all the games and performed at a level that is comparable or superior to a professional human game tester. It is sometimes called Deep-Q network (DQN). In AlphaGo, deep neural networks are trained not only by reinforcement learning, but also by supervised learning and Monte Carlo tree search."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.
