To make it worse, password managers currently do not notice the difference between full and Instant Apps, and they can thus be tricked to leak credentials even to them.\n\nTo make things worse, we have found that current password managers autofill hidden fields as well.

We have studied the leading password managers for mobile and we uncovered a number of design issues that leave them open to attacks. For example, we show it is possible to trick password managers into auto-suggesting credentials associated with arbitrary attacker-chosen websites. We then show how an attacker can abuse the recently introduced Instant Apps technology to allow a remote attacker to gain full UI control and, by abusing password managers, to implement an end-to-end phishing attack requiring only few user\u2019s clicks.

That is, an attacker could make this attack even more practical by luring the user to approve and download the Instant App beforehand and for phishing-unrelated, seemingly innocuous reasons, to then make the transition from 'Click to the like button' to 'Spoofed Facebook UI' really seamless. We believe this attack strategy significantly lowers the bar, with respect to all known phishing attacks on the web and mobile devices: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attack that does not assume a malicious app already installed on the phone and that does not even require the user to insert her credentials. These attacks are strictly more practical than all currently known mobile phishing works [8, 9, 16, 36]."], "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/38": ["The key observation is that Instant Apps allow an attacker to move from web phishing to mobile phishing. Nowadays, web phishing is significantly more challenging than mobile phishing. On the web, the user can clearly see which website she is interacting with: she has the chance to check the domain name, whether the connection is done via HTTPS, and whether there is a valid SSL certificate. In the mobile world, however, there are no such indicators. In fact, as previous works have pointed out [8, 9, 36], there is currently no \u201cgreen lock\u201d or any space for any trusted indicator: these previous works have shown that a malicious app spoofing the Facebook UI can be made indistinguishable from the legitimate Facebook app\u2014even for a security-savvy user. The key requirement for these pixel-perfect attacks is the ability to control all the pixels on the screen. A website cannot achieve that, but an attacker can use Instant Apps to do just that: gain code execution on the device outside the browser\u2019s JavaScript sandbox and gain the ability to fully control the UI (without requesting any permission).\n\nOnce the attacker has gained full UI control, there are many possibilities. One first example is that the Instant App could resemble the real Facebook app, which can be made indistinguishable from the legitimate one. A second example would be to resemble the browser app itself : as the attacker controls every pixel of the screen, nothing prevents her from showing the user a browser-like view with a spoofed facebook.com domain name and a green lock.

First, the developer builds an Instant App, a small-but-functional version of her app, and she uploads it to the Play Store. The developer is also asked to associate a URL pattern to it (pointing to a domain name she controls). The idea is that when the user browses to a URL satisfying this pattern, the Android framework starts the process of downloading and running the Instant App associated with it. Of course, for security reasons, the app developer needs to first prove to Google that she controls the target domain name. This is carried out through a multi-step procedure called App Link Verification [27], which relies on Digital Asset Links [17] protocol (this makes possible to associate an app with a website and vice versa, via verifiable statements).\n\nThe key observation is that Instant Apps allow an attacker to move from web phishing to mobile phishing. Nowadays, web phishing is significantly more challenging than mobile phishing. On the web, the user can clearly see which website she is interacting with: she has the chance to check the domain name, whether the connection is done via HTTPS, and whether there is a valid SSL certificate. In the mobile world, however, there are no such indicators. In fact, as previous works have pointed out [8, 9, 36], there is currently no \u201cgreen lock\u201d or any space for any trusted indicator: these previous works have shown that a malicious app spoofing the Facebook UI can be made indistinguishable from the legitimate Facebook app\u2014even for a security-savvy user. The key requirement for these pixel-perfect attacks is the ability to control all the pixels on the screen. A website cannot achieve that, but an attacker can use Instant Apps to do just that: gain code execution on the device outside the browser\u2019s JavaScript sandbox and gain the ability to fully control the UI (without requesting any permission).\n\nOnce the attacker has gained full UI control, there are many possibilities. One first example is that the Instant App could resemble the real Facebook app, which can be made indistinguishable from the legitimate one. A second example would be to resemble the browser app itself : as the attacker controls every pixel of the screen, nothing prevents her from showing the user a browser-like view with a spoofed facebook.com domain name and a green lock.

This can typically happen when a user logs on to any site that implements the HTTP Secure protocol. In this example let us suppose that the user logs on to their bank's homepage www.bank.example to do online banking. When the user opens www.bank.example homepage, they receive a public key along with all the data that their web-browser displays. The public key could be used to encrypt data from the client to the server but the safe procedure is to use it in a protocol that determines a temporary shared symmetric encryption key; messages in such a key exchange protocol can be enciphered with the bank's public key in such a way that only the bank server has the private key to read them. The rest of the communication then proceeds using the new (disposable) symmetric key, so when the user enters some information to the bank's page and submits the page (sends the information back to the bank) then the data the user has entered to the page will be encrypted by their web browser. Therefore, even if someone can access the (encrypted) data that was communicated from the user to www.bank.example, such eavesdropper cannot read or decipher it. This mechanism is only safe if the user can be sure that it is the bank that they see in their web browser. If the user types in www.bank.example, but their communication is hijacked and a fake website (that pretends to be the bank website) sends the page information back to the user's browser, the fake web-page can send a fake public key to the user (for which the fake site owns a matching private key). The user will fill the form with their personal data and will submit the page. The fake web-page will then get access to the user's data. This is what the certificate authority mechanism is intended to prevent. A certificate authority (CA) is an organization that stores public keys and their owners, and every party in a communication trusts this organization (and knows its public key). When the user's web browser receives the public key from www.bank.example it also receives a digital signature of the key (with some more information, in a so-called X.509 certificate). The browser already possesses the public key of the CA and consequently can verify the signature, trust the certificate and the public key in it: since www.bank.example uses a public key that the certification authority certifies, a fake www.bank.example can only use the same public key. Since the fake www.bank.example does not know the corresponding private key, it cannot create the signature needed to verify its authenticity."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Domain-validated certificates existed before validation standards, and generally only require some proof of domain control. In particular, domain-validated certificates do not assert that a given legal entity has any relationship with the domain, although the domain may resemble a particular legal entity.\n\nIn the past, most browsers' user interfaces did not clearly differentiate between low-validation certificates and those that have undergone more rigorous vetting. Since any successful SSL/TLS connection would cause a green padlock icon to appear in most browsers, users were not likely to be aware of whether the website owner has been validated or not. As a result, fraudsters (including phishing websites) could use TLS to add perceived credibility to their websites. Users of modern browsers can always check the identity of certificate owners by examining the details of the issued certificate which always indicates the certificate owner information such as the name of the organization and its location.\n\nEV certificates are validated against both the Baseline Requirements and the Extended Validation requirements, which place additional requirements on how authorities vet companies. These include manual checks of all the domain names requested by the applicant, checks against official government sources, checks against independent information sources, and phone calls to the company to confirm the position of the applicant. If the certificate is accepted, the government-registered serial number of the business as well as the physical address are stored in the EV certificate.\n\nBy establishing stricter issuing criteria and requiring consistent application of those criteria by all participating CAs, EV certificates are intended to restore confidence among users that a website operator is a legally established business or organization with a verifiable identity."], "wikipedia-296370": ["Trusted certificates can be used to create secure connections to a server via the Internet.

To determine the readiness of the ecosystem to this mechanism, we first built a dataset of 8,821 domain names extracted from the password managers we have analyzed (given the source of this dataset, these domain names are guaranteed to have at least one login form, otherwise they would not be relevant to password managers). We then checked how many websites already link themselves to an app: to our surprise, only 178 of them currently have an assetlinks.json compatible with the proposed solution, which is around 2%. This means that, to date, password managers developers do not have the necessary information to securely implement their functionality, even if they wanted to. One may then wonder how Google Smart Lock, which we found to be secure, implements such mapping.

For instance, we submitted to the Play Store an app with package name com.lin.uber.face: when opening this app, Dashlane promptly suggests Linkedin, Uber, and Facebook credentials. Regarding OpenYOLO, Dashlane is exploitable exactly as a11y/Autofill Framework, since the selection of credentials relies on the package name, which is parsed as previously described. Therefore, we wrote another malicious app embedding the OpenYOLO client library and we were able to obtain the credentials. Interestingly, we have noticed that when Dashlane uses Autofill Framework instead of a11y, it performs some additional checks and it is able to determine that our simple proof-of-concept attempting to impersonate Facebook cannot be verified.

As highlighted by several recent works, the key insight is that the UI on mobile devices cannot be trusted, and Instant Apps provide a technical way for an attacker to move from a scenario where she does not fully control it (like a web page somehow constrained by the web browser security mechanisms) to a scenario where she fully does."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-33043045": 1, "wikipedia-40958": 1, "wikipedia-487940": 1, "wikipedia-161905": 1, "wikipedia-7764175": 1, "wikipedia-2023185": 1, "wikipedia-41096": 1, "wikipedia-3943130": 1, "wikipedia-18629502": 1, "wikipedia-38233555": 1, "arxiv-1107.5594": 1, "arxiv-2109.11592": 1, "arxiv-2212.04281": 1, "arxiv-1803.10042": 1, "arxiv-2212.12306": 1, "arxiv-2202.10072": 1, "arxiv-1705.10854": 1, "arxiv-2303.16282": 1, "arxiv-2405.15753": 1, "arxiv-2106.05702": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/10": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/25": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/29": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/49": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/43": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/24": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/28": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-33043045": 1, "wikipedia-40958": 1, "wikipedia-487940": 1, "wikipedia-161905": 1, "wikipedia-7764175": 1, "wikipedia-2023185": 1, "wikipedia-41096": 1, "wikipedia-3943130": 1, "wikipedia-18629502": 1, "wikipedia-38233555": 1, "arxiv-1107.5594": 1, "arxiv-2109.11592": 1, "arxiv-2212.04281": 1, "arxiv-1803.10042": 1, "arxiv-2212.12306": 1, "arxiv-2202.10072": 1, "arxiv-1705.10854": 1, "arxiv-2303.16282": 1, "arxiv-2405.15753": 1, "arxiv-2106.05702": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/10": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/25": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/29": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/49": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/43": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/24": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/8": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/28": 1}}}

The Java Language Specification establishes package naming conventions to avoid the possibility of two published packages having the same name. The naming conventions describe how to create unique package names, so that packages that are widely distributed will have unique namespaces. This allows packages to be separately, easily and automatically installed and catalogued.\nIn general, a package name begins with the top level domain name of the organization and then the organization's domain and then any subdomains, listed in reverse order. The organization can then choose a specific name for its package. Subsequent components of the package name vary according to an organization's own internal naming conventions.\nFor example, if an organization in Canada called MySoft creates a package to deal with fractions, naming the package ca.mysoft.fractions distinguishes the fractions package from another similar package created by another company.

Although packages lower in the naming hierarchy are often referred to as \"subpackages\" of the corresponding packages higher in the hierarchy, there is almost no semantic relationship between packages. The Java Language Specification establishes package naming conventions to avoid the possibility of two published packages having the same name. The naming conventions describe how to create unique package names, so that packages that are widely distributed will have unique namespaces. This allows packages to be separately, easily and automatically installed and catalogued. In general, a package name begins with the top level domain name of the organization and then the organization's domain and then any subdomains, listed in reverse order. The organization can then choose a specific name for its package. Subsequent components of the package name vary according to an organization's own internal naming conventions. For example, if an organization in Canada called MySoft creates a package to deal with fractions, naming the package ca.mysoft.fractions distinguishes the fractions package from another similar package created by another company.

For instance, we found a mapping between package names com.tinder and com.tinderautoliker2 associated to the web domain facebook.com: Tinder is a dating app that needs Facebook credentials to authenticate the user, while TinderAutoLiker is an app available on alternative markets that automates some actions on Tinder services."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-37116345": 1, "wikipedia-52768320": 1, "wikipedia-1507752": 1, "wikipedia-8339": 1, "wikipedia-4870290": 1, "wikipedia-320025": 1, "wikipedia-25076961": 1, "wikipedia-3219147": 1, "wikipedia-52177827": 1, "wikipedia-3567275": 1, "arxiv-2412.17537": 1, "arxiv-1504.02615": 1, "arxiv-1507.00942": 1, "arxiv-2007.08555": 1, "arxiv-0902.0406": 1, "arxiv-0911.0473": 1, "arxiv-2306.16307": 1, "arxiv-2307.02860": 1, "arxiv-2402.18956": 1, "arxiv-1105.5451": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/21": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/31": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/27": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/28": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/19": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/29": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/25": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/11": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/46": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/35": 2}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-37116345": 1, "wikipedia-52768320": 1, "wikipedia-1507752": 1, "wikipedia-8339": 1, "wikipedia-4870290": 1, "wikipedia-320025": 1, "wikipedia-25076961": 1, "wikipedia-3219147": 1, "wikipedia-52177827": 1, "wikipedia-3567275": 2, "arxiv-2412.17537": 1, "arxiv-1504.02615": 1, "arxiv-1507.00942": 1, "arxiv-2007.08555": 1, "arxiv-0902.0406": 1, "arxiv-0911.0473": 1, "arxiv-2306.16307": 1, "arxiv-2307.02860": 1, "arxiv-2402.18956": 1, "arxiv-1105.5451": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/21": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/31": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/27": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/28": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/19": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/29": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/25": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/11": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/46": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/35": 3}}}

Regarding OpenYOLO, Dashlane is exploitable exactly as a11y/Autofill Framework, since the selection of credentials relies on the package name, which is parsed as previously described. Therefore, we wrote another malicious app embedding the OpenYOLO client library and we were able to obtain the credentials. Interestingly, we have noticed that when Dashlane uses Autofill Framework instead of a11y, it performs some additional checks and it is able to determine that our simple proof-of-concept attempting to impersonate Facebook cannot be verified. In this case, a warning is shown to the user. To the best of our understanding, Dashlane employs a hardcoded list of well-known package name and signature pairs, and it checks our app against it. This is a promising step forward in the right direction. However, we found that these checks are easily bypassable.

One first example is that the Instant App could resemble the real Facebook app, which can be made indistinguishable from the legitimate one. A second example would be to resemble the browser app itself : as the attacker controls every pixel of the screen, nothing prevents her from showing the user a browser-like view with a spoofed facebook.com domain name and a green lock.

The safest way to implement a mapping consists in securely verifying whether the developers of the current app have authority over a given domain name: if that is the case, then it is safe to auto-suggest the credentials of such domain name to the current app. One known solution to achieve this mapping is called Digital Asset Links [17] (DAL from now on). From a conceptual point of view, DAL allows for the definition of authentication domain equivalence classes, and it makes it possible to associate an app with a website and vice versa, via verifiable statements. This mechanism works by asking websites owners to publish on their website an \u201cassets\u201d file that contains a list of apps that can be legitimately associated with it.

A third-party can then verify that an app is indeed legitimately linked to a website by checking whether the \u201cassets\u201d include a matching package name and the hash of the signing key.\nStatic one-to-one mapping. Consider a PM with a static one-to-one mapping, which maps one package name to exactly one domain name, and vice versa. As an example, consider the legitimate Facebook app, whose package name is com.facebook.katana, which is usually mapped to the facebook.com domain name. This simple mapping technique is vulnerable: in fact, Facebook credentials are suggested to any app whose package name is com.facebook.katana, even if the app is not the legitimate one. It would be possible to prevent this vulnerability by checking the certificate that signed the target app, and make sure it is one of the known, trusted one. Unfortunately, maintaining such list of known trusted certificates is a very challenging task. We consider this a vulnerability, but the attack is not very practical: in fact, the malicious app cannot co-exist with the legitimate one."], "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/28": ["This typology of mapping is problematic because it is frequent that the user would install onlyone (or a subset) of these apps. Thus, a malicious app with one of the remaining package names is able to steal the credentials. This attacker is more practical than the previous one because it does not require the attacker to lure the user to uninstall the legitimate app. However, the package names specified in the mapping likely refer to real legitimate apps on the Play Store. This means that the attacker cannot upload her malicious app on the Play Store (because package names need to be unique across the store), and the app needs to be side-loaded."], "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/35": ["Mapping implementation. LastPass relies on two mappings. The first one is, once again, heuristic-based, and it works as follows. Given a package name, e.g., aaa.bbb.ccc, LastPass splits it in components separated by the dots (e.g., aaa, bbb, and ccc), and it builds a domain name pattern by using the first two in reversed order (e.g., bbb.aaa). LastPass will then suggest to the user all the credentials associated with domain names that end such pattern. In case an entry does not exist, LastPass allows the user to search among her locally stored credentials and select (in case) one of them, thereby defining a new entry for the mapping. As such entries may be useful for other users worldwide, LastPass allows the user to share them with the community. This sharing step is at the basis of the second mapping, a crowdsourced mapping. LastPass downloads this global database at the first installation. At the time of writing, we found 19,273 crowdsourced mapping entries with repeated package names and domains, mostly many-to-one. For instance, we found a mapping between package names com.tinder and com.tinderautoliker2 associated to the web domain facebook.com: Tinder is a dating app that needs Facebook credentials to authenticate the user, while TinderAutoLiker is an app available on alternative markets that automates some actions on Tinder services. It is also worth noting that the crowdsourced mapping contains errors, like invalid domains, domains with typos, and IP addresses belonging to local networks. Exploitation. To exploit the first mapping strategy, the attacker can create an app with a package name beginning with the reverse of the target domain name. For example, we created an app with package name com.facebook.evil and we were able to upload it to the Play Store without problems: when the user opens this app, LastPass automatically suggests credentials related to facebook.com. From the conceptual point of view, an attacker could exploit the second mapping as well. In fact, if the attacker is able to inject an arbitrary association, she can directly indicate to LastPass that, for example, her own package name should be associated to, say, facebook.com. For the sake of completeness, we tried to share with LastPass an association from one of our package name app to one of our test websites. However, this association did not become public to all users. We assume that LastPass make these \u201cnew\u201d associations available to all its users only when a number higher than a threshold suggested them. An attacker could try to create a high number of fake accounts and to automatically share these fake associations. However, we have opted not to do it for ethical reasons. Moreover, an attacker can already game LastPass suggestion mechanism by exploiting the first mapping."], "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/7": ["In fact, web password managers check the current website domain name to determine whether to auto-fill (or auto-suggest) credentials: if the domain name does not match the expectations, no credentials are suggested.

From a conceptual point of view, DAL allows for the definition of authentication domain equivalence classes, and it makes it possible to associate an app with a website and vice versa, via verifiable statements. This mechanism works by asking websites owners to publish on their website an \u201cassets\u201d file that contains a list of apps that can be legitimately associated with it. In this case, each app is identified by its package name and by the hash of its legitimate signing key.

Consider a PM with a static one-to-one mapping, which maps one package name to exactly one domain name, and vice versa. As an example, consider the legitimate Facebook app, whose package name is com.facebook.katana, which is usually mapped to the facebook.com domain name. This simple mapping technique is vulnerable: in fact, Facebook credentials are suggested to any app whose package name is com.facebook.katana, even if the app is not the legitimate one. It would be possible to prevent this vulnerability by checking the certificate that signed the target app, and make sure it is one of the known, trusted one. Unfortunately, maintaining such list of known trusted certificates is a very challenging task.

Internally, this new API relies on an existing technical solution based on Digital Asset Links [17] verification. This solution requires websites owners to publish an \u201cassets\u201d file on their website so that an app-website \u201clink\u201d can be established. This is the same mechanism that Autofill Framework and OpenYOLO suggest developers to use: the difference is that our API forces them to use it, instead of leaving them open to implement vulnerable solutions\u2014as they did. Unfortunately, although we believe that this solution is technically sound, the current ecosystem is far from being ready. In fact, the App Link Verification requires collaboration from websites owners, as they would need to upload the appropriate assets file to their website. To determine the readiness of the ecosystem to this mechanism, we first built a dataset of 8,821 domain names extracted from the password managers we have analyzed (given the source of this dataset, these domain names are guaranteed to have at least one login form, otherwise they would not be relevant to password managers). We then checked how many websites already link themselves to an app: to our surprise, only 178 of them currently have an assetlinks.json compatible with the proposed solution, which is around 2%.

We then checked how many websites already link themselves to an app: to our surprise, only 178 of them currently have an assetlinks.json compatible with the proposed solution, which is around 2%. This means that, to date, password managers developers do not have the necessary information to securely implement their functionality, even if they wanted to.

Telescopes cannot see events earlier than about 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when the universe became transparent (the cosmic microwave background); this corresponds to the particle horizon at a distance of about 46 billion (4.6\u00d710) light years. Since the matter causing the net motion in this proposal is outside this range, it would in a certain sense be outside our visible universe; however, it would still be in our past light cone.\n\nThe results appeared in the October 20, 2008, issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nIn 2013, data from the Planck space telescope showed no evidence of \"dark flow\" on that sort of scale, discounting the claims of evidence for either gravitational effects reaching beyond the visible universe or existence of a multiverse. However, in 2015 Kashlinsky \"et al\" claim to have found support for its existence using both Planck and WMAP data."], "wikipedia-9299479": ["In 2008, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) SELENE lunar probe obtained several photographs showing evidence of Moon landings. On the left are two photos taken on the lunar surface by the Apollo 15 astronauts August 2, 1971 during EVA 3 at station 9A near Hadley Rille. On the right is a 2008 reconstruction from images taken by the SELENE terrain camera and 3D projected to the same vantage point as the surface photos. The terrain is a close match within the SELENE camera resolution of 10 metres.\nThe light-colored area of blown lunar surface dust created by the lunar module engine blast at the Apollo 15 landing site was photographed and confirmed by comparative analysis of photographs in May 2008. They correspond well to photographs taken from the Apollo 15 Command/Service Module showing a change in surface reflectivity due to the plume. This was the first visible trace of crewed landings on the Moon seen from space since the close of the Apollo program.\n\nAs with SELENE, the Terrain Mapping Camera of India's Chandrayaan-1 probe did not have enough resolution to record Apollo hardware. Nevertheless, as with SELENE, Chandrayaan-1 independently recorded evidence of lighter, disturbed soil around the Apollo 15 site.\n\nChina's second lunar probe, Chang'e 2, which was launched in 2010 is capable of capturing lunar surface images with a resolution of up to 1.3 metres. It claims to have spotted traces of the Apollo landings and the lunar Rover, though the relevant imagery has not been publicly identified."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

Upon clicking on it, the Instant App mechanism is triggered, the attacker can spoof a full-screen Facebook login form, at which point the password manager would offer to automatically fill the credentials on behalf of the victim. To make things worse, we found that current password managers fill hidden fields as well. An attacker could thus create a form with a visible username field but a hidden password field: while the unsuspecting user thinks she is autofilling only the username, her password manager will silently leak her password to the attacker. To the best of our knowledge, the attacks presented in this paper are the most advanced and practical phishing attack techniques to date. In fact, all existing approaches assume a malicious app installed on the user\u2019s device, ask the user to manually insert her credentials (which although not technically problematic, may reduce the attack success rate), or fall back to web-based phishing attacks (that are noticeable at least from the browser bar) [8, 9, 16, 36]."], "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/8": ["In this paper, we show that this technology, while indeed a very useful Android feature, can make phishing attacks more practical. The key observation is that Instant Apps provide an attacker the ability to gain full control over the device UI, without the need of installing an app. In a browser-only phishing scenario, the user would have a chance to notice the green lock and inspect the domain name. However, in an Instant Apps-based attack, the attacker has full capabilities to deceive the user. For example, an attacker could create a full-screen Facebook login view (as the real Facebook app would do). As reported in existing works [4, 8, 9, 36], users cannot distinguish between these. As another example, an attacker could simulate the view of a full browser; as the attacker controls every pixel of the screen, nothing prevents her to show the user a browser-like view with a spoofed facebook.com domain name and a green lock: once again, this attack is indistinguishable from a legitimate scenario. As highlighted by several recent works, the key insight is that the UI on mobile devices cannot be trusted, and Instant Apps provide a technical way for an attacker to move from a scenario where she does not fully control it (like a web page somehow constrained by the web browser security mechanisms) to a scenario where she fully does."], "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/0": ["We then show how an attacker can abuse the recently introduced Instant Apps technology to allow a remote attacker to gain full UI control and, by abusing password managers, to implement an end-to-end phishing attack requiring only few user\u2019s clicks."], "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/25": ["Q1) Is the mapping vulnerable? The first question is, of course, about whether the mapping is vulnerable or not. We consider a mapping as vulnerable if an attacker can create an app that, although not being the legitimate one, can trick PMs into auto-suggesting credentials associated to a given website.\nQ2) Can the legitimate and malicious apps co-exist? One of the most basic attack vectors is for a malicious app to have the same package name as the legitimate one. Since no two apps installed on the same device can have the same package name, this implies that, in this scenario, the legitimate and the malicious app cannot co-exist. This, in turn, implies that an attacker exploiting this package name-colliding technique would need to first lure the user to uninstall the legitimate app before the attack can be performed. Of course, this poses practicality issues. Thus, this question is about: can an attacker bypass this constraint? In other words, to give an example, can an attacker create a malicious app that can co-exist with the legitimate Facebook app and that, when opened, would trick PMs to auto-suggest the legitimate Facebook credentials?\nQ3) Can the malicious app be hosted on the Play Store? In the general case, it is more difficult to lure the user to install an app that is not hosted on the Play Store. Thus, one relevant question is: is it possible for an attacker to upload her malicious app to the Play Store?

A less-ideal scenario is a PM where all the credentials are always suggested: although the user has the possibility to lure her credentials to the malicious app, this attack would be slightly less practical.

In this section, we enumerate some questions related to the attacker capabilities. We will put them in relation to each vulnerable mapping in the next subsection.\nQ1) Is the mapping vulnerable? The first question is, of course, about whether the mapping is vulnerable or not. We consider a mapping as vulnerable if an attacker can create an app that, although not being the legitimate one, can trick PMs into auto-suggesting credentials associated to a given website.\nQ2) Can the legitimate and malicious apps co-exist? One of the most basic attack vectors is for a malicious app to have the same package name as the legitimate one. Since no two apps installed on the same device can have the same package name, this implies that, in this scenario, the legitimate and the malicious app cannot co-exist. This, in turn, implies that an attacker exploiting this package name-colliding technique would need to first lure the user to uninstall the legitimate app before the attack can be performed. Of course, this poses practicality issues. Thus, this question is about: can an attacker bypass this constraint? In other words, to give an example, can an attacker create a malicious app that can co-exist with the legitimate Facebook app and that, when opened, would trick PMs to auto-suggest the legitimate Facebook credentials?\nQ3) Can the malicious app be hosted on the Play Store? In the general case, it is more difficult to lure the user to install an app that is not hosted on the Play Store. Thus, one relevant question is: is it possible for an attacker to upload her malicious app to the Play Store? The main constraint for an attacker is that no two apps with the same package name can be hosted on the Play Store at the same time. In other words, this question asks whether an attack requires creating an app with the same package name of an already-existing app on the Play Store.

However, in an Instant Apps-based attack, the attacker has full capabilities to deceive the user. For example, an attacker could create a full-screen Facebook login view (as the real Facebook app would do). As reported in existing works [4, 8, 9, 36], users cannot distinguish between these.

As highlighted by several recent works, the key insight is that the UI on mobile devices cannot be trusted, and Instant Apps provide a technical way for an attacker to move from a scenario where she does not fully control it (like a web page somehow constrained by the web browser security mechanisms) to a scenario where she fully does."], "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/10": ["This means that the package name of the Instant App is attacker-controlled, and that it is thus possible to trick password managers to auto-fill credentials for an attacker-chosen website even without requiring the installation of an additional app. This allows an attacker to bootstrap an end-to-end phishing attack by luring the victim into visiting a malicious webpage: such webpage may contain, for example, a fake Facebook-related functionality.

Nowadays, web phishing is significantly more challenging than mobile phishing. On the web, the user can clearly see which website she is interacting with: she has the chance to check the domain name, whether the connection is done via HTTPS, and whether there is a valid SSL certificate. In the mobile world, however, there are no such indicators. In fact, as previous works have pointed out [8, 9, 36], there is currently no \u201cgreen lock\u201d or any space for any trusted indicator: these previous works have shown that a malicious app spoofing the Facebook UI can be made indistinguishable from the legitimate Facebook app\u2014even for a security-savvy user. The key requirement for these pixel-perfect attacks is the ability to control all the pixels on the screen. A website cannot achieve that, but an attacker can use Instant Apps to do just that: gain code execution on the device outside the browser\u2019s JavaScript sandbox and gain the ability to fully control the UI (without requesting any permission).\n\nOnce the attacker has gained full UI control, there are many possibilities. One first example is that the Instant App could resemble the real Facebook app, which can be made indistinguishable from the legitimate one. A second example would be to resemble the browser app itself : as the attacker controls every pixel of the screen, nothing prevents her from showing the user a browser-like view with a spoofed facebook.com domain name and a green lock.

In this section, we enumerate some questions related to the attacker capabilities. We will put them in relation to each vulnerable mapping in the next subsection.\nQ1) Is the mapping vulnerable? The first question is, of course, about whether the mapping is vulnerable or not. We consider a mapping as vulnerable if an attacker can create an app that, although not being the legitimate one, can trick PMs into auto-suggesting credentials associated to a given website.\nQ2) Can the legitimate and malicious apps co-exist? One of the most basic attack vectors is for a malicious app to have the same package name as the legitimate one. Since no two apps installed on the same device can have the same package name, this implies that, in this scenario, the legitimate and the malicious app cannot co-exist. This, in turn, implies that an attacker exploiting this package name-colliding technique would need to first lure the user to uninstall the legitimate app before the attack can be performed. Of course, this poses practicality issues. Thus, this question is about: can an attacker bypass this constraint? In other words, to give an example, can an attacker create a malicious app that can co-exist with the legitimate Facebook app and that, when opened, would trick PMs to auto-suggest the legitimate Facebook credentials?\nQ3) Can the malicious app be hosted on the Play Store? In the general case, it is more difficult to lure the user to install an app that is not hosted on the Play Store. Thus, one relevant question is: is it possible for an attacker to upload her malicious app to the Play Store? The main constraint for an attacker is that no two apps with the same package name can be hosted on the Play Store at the same time. In other words, this question asks whether an attack requires creating an app with the same package name of an already-existing app on the Play Store. If yes, the only venue for the attacker is to lure the user to install the malicious app from a third-party market (via the side-loading process): although this attack is possible, it is less practical.\nQ4) Can the attacker generate tailored suggestions? PMs have the capability to auto-suggest one or more set of credentials. Then, the user can choose one of them and, at the touch of a click, these credentials are automatically filled in the target app. Now, from an attacker perspective, the ideal situation would be to able to write a malicious app such that, for example, the PM would only suggest the credentials of facebook.com (or any other domain name chosen by the attacker). A less-ideal scenario is a PM where all the credentials are always suggested: although the user has the possibility to lure her credentials to the malicious app, this attack would be slightly less practical. Thus, the question is: can the attacker have fine-grained control over which and how many credentials are suggested?"]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This pop-up window, which the user now believes to be part of the targeted session, is then used to steal user data in the same way as with other phishing attacks.\nThe advantage of in-session phishing to the attacker is that it does not need the targeted website to be compromised in any way, relying instead on a combination of data leakage within the web browser, the capacity of web browsers to run active content, the ability of modern web browsers to support more than one session at a time, and social engineering of the user.\nThe technique, which exploited a vulnerability in the Javascript handling of major browsers, was found by Amit Klein, CTO of security vendor Trusteer, Ltd.

The attack's name was coined in early 2010 by Aza Raskin, a security researcher and design expert. The attack takes advantage of user trust and inattention to detail in regard to tabs, and the ability of browsers to navigate across a page's origin in inactive tabs a long time after the page is loaded. Tabnabbing is different from most phishing attacks in that the user no longer remembers that a certain tab was the result of a link unrelated to the login page, because the fake login page is loaded in one of the long-lived open tabs in their browser.\nThe attack causes the browser to navigate to the impersonated page after the page has been left unattended for some time. A user who returns after a while and sees the login page may be induced to believe the page is legitimate and enter their login, password and other details that will be used for improper purposes. The attack can be made more likely to succeed if the attacker is able to check for well known websites the user has loaded in the past or in other tabs, and loads a simulation of the same sites.

Figures have consistent facial appearances, hold attributes personal to them, and use a few conventional poses.\nColour plays an important role as well. Gold represents the radiance of Heaven; red, divine life. Blue is the color of human life, white is the Uncreated Light of God, only used for resurrection and transfiguration of Christ. If you look at icons of Jesus and Mary: Jesus wears red undergarment with a blue outer garment (God become Human) and Mary wears a blue undergarment with a red overgarment (human was granted gifts by God), thus the doctrine of deification is conveyed by icons.

It identifies a specific service exposed on a specific server.\ndoc_lines:\nEach doc-string contained in a doc_lines list reflects a single line of documentation that relates to the parent object of the doc_lines..\nSection::::Specifications.:Request object.\nThe request object contains information about which method to invoke and what arguments to invoke the method with. It also stores information about the type and version of itself.\nThe optional mirror value can be used to send information from the client which will then be reflected by the server and returned unchanged in the response object's reflection value.

It can be used anywhere in the description as a primitive type. In requests and responses that involve attachments, the message format must be multipart/related where the attachments are transported as mimeparts of media type: application/octet-stream with no Content-Transfer-Encoding (only raw binary).

Strings are delimited with double-quotation marks and support a backslash escaping syntax.\nBULLET::::- Boolean: either of the values codice_3 or codice_4\nBULLET::::- Array: an ordered list of zero or more values, each of which may be of any type. Arrays use square bracket notation and elements are comma-separated.\nBULLET::::- Object: an unordered collection of name\u2013value pairs where the names (also called keys) are strings. Since objects are intended to represent associative arrays, it is recommended, though not required, that each key is unique within an object. Objects are delimited with curly brackets and use commas to separate each pair, while within each pair the colon ':' character separates the key or name from its value.\nBULLET::::- codice_5: An empty value, using the word codice_6\nLimited whitespace is allowed and ignored around or between syntactic elements (values and punctuation, but not within a string value).

The process employs the use of a cryptographic hash to validate authenticity and integrity.\nAlmost every code signing implementation will provide some sort of digital signature mechanism to verify the identity of the author or build system, and a checksum to verify that the object has not been modified. It can also be used to provide versioning information about an object or to store other meta data about an object.\nThe efficacy of code signing as an authentication mechanism for software depends on the security of underpinning signing keys. As with other public key infrastructure (PKI) technologies, the integrity of the system relies on publishers securing their private keys against unauthorized access.\nMany code signing implementations will provide a way to sign the code using a system involving a pair of keys, one public and one private, similar to the process employed by TLS or SSH. For example, in the case of .NET, the developer uses a private key to sign their libraries or executables each time they build. This key will be unique to a developer or group or sometimes per application or object. The developer can either generate this key on their own or obtain one from a trusted certificate authority (CA).\nCode signing is particularly valuable in distributed environments, where the source of a given piece of code may not be immediately evident - for example Java applets, ActiveX controls and other active web and browser scripting code. Another important usage is to safely provide updates and patches to existing software. Windows, Mac OS X, and most Linux distributions provide updates using code signing to ensure that it is not possible for others to maliciously distribute code via the patch system. It allows the receiving operating system to verify that the update is legitimate, even if the update was delivered by third parties or physical media (disks).\nCode signing is used on Windows and Mac OS X to authenticate software on first run, ensuring that the software has not been maliciously tampered with by a third-party distributor or download site. This form of code signing is not used on Linux because of that platform's decentralized nature, the package manager being the predominant mode of distribution for all forms of software (not just updates and patches), as well as the open-source model allowing direct inspection of the source code if desired. Debian-based Linux distributions (among others) validate downloaded packages using public key cryptography."], "wikipedia-337389": ["DNSSEC works by digitally signing records for DNS lookup using public-key cryptography.

The RRSIG record is a digital signature of the answer DNS resource record set. The digital signature is verified by locating the correct public key found in a DNSKEY record. The NSEC and NSEC3 records are used to provide cryptographic evidence of the non-existence of any RR.

It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.\nThe Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over sub-domains of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and fault-tolerant service and was designed to avoid a single large central database.\nThe Domain Name System also specifies the technical functionality of the database service that is at its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the Internet Protocol Suite.\nThe Internet maintains two principal namespaces, the domain name hierarchy and the Internet Protocol (IP\") address spaces. The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address spaces. Internet name servers and a communication protocol implement the Domain Name System. A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database.\nThe most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for Start of Authority (SOA), IP addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP mail exchangers (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME). Although not intended to be a general purpose database, DNS has been expanded over time to store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups, such as DNSSEC records, or for human queries such as \"responsible person\" (RP) records. As a general purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating unsolicited email (spam) by storing a real-time blackhole list (RBL). The DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured text file, the zone file, but other database systems are common.\nAn often-used analogy to explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the phone book for the Internet by translating human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses. For example, the domain name www.example.com translates to the addresses (IPv4) and (IPv6). The DNS can be quickly and transparently updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue to use the same hostname. Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and e-mail addresses without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.\nAn important and ubiquitous function of DNS is its central role in distributed Internet services such as cloud services and content delivery networks. When a user accesses a distributed Internet service using a URL, the domain name of the URL is translated to the IP address of a server that is proximal to the user. The key functionality of DNS exploited here is that different users can \"simultaneously\" receive different translations for the \"same\" domain name, a key point of divergence from a traditional phone-book view of the DNS. This process of using the DNS to assign proximal servers to users is key to providing faster and more reliable responses on the Internet and is widely used by most major Internet services."], "wikipedia-39241": ["An example of a name server is the server component of the Domain Name System (DNS), one of the two principal namespaces of the Internet. The most important function of DNS servers is the translation (resolution) of human-memorable domain names and hostnames into the corresponding numeric Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, the second principal name space of the Internet which is used to identify and locate computer systems and resources on the Internet.\n\nThe Internet maintains two principal namespaces: the domain name hierarchy and the IP address system. The Domain Name System maintains the domain namespace and provides translation services between these two namespaces. Internet name servers implement the Domain Name System. The top hierarchy of the Domain Name System is served by the root name servers maintained by delegation by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Below the root, Internet resources are organized into a hierarchy of domains, administered by the respective registrars and domain name holders. A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records, such as address (A, AAAA) records, name server (NS) records, and mail exchanger (MX) records for a domain name (see also List of DNS record types) and responds with answers to queries against its database.\n\nIf a name server cannot answer a query because it does not contain an entry for the host in its DNS cache, it may recursively query name servers higher up in the hierarchy. This is known as a \"recursive query\" or \"recursive lookup\". A server providing recursive queries is known as a \"recursive name server\" or \"recursive DNS\", sometimes abbreviated as recdns.\n\nIn principle, authoritative name servers suffice for the operation of the Internet. However, with only authoritative name-servers operating, every DNS query must start with recursive queries at the root zone of the Domain Name System and each user system must implement resolver software capable of recursive operation.\n\nCaching name servers (\"DNS caches\") store DNS query results for a period of time determined in the configuration (time-to-live) of each domain-name record. DNS caches improve the efficiency of the DNS by reducing DNS traffic across the Internet, and by reducing load on authoritative name-servers, particularly root name-servers.

If an outlier is chosen to calculate the current setting, then the resulting line will have little support from the rest of the points.\nThe algorithm that is performed is a loop that performs the following steps:\nBULLET::::1. Of the entire input data set, takes a subset randomly to estimate the model.\nBULLET::::2. Compute model subset. The model is estimated with standard linear algorithms.\nBULLET::::3. Find the matching values of transformation.\nBULLET::::4. If the error is minimal model, this is accepted, and if the number of correspondences is long enough, the subset of points involved consensus assembly is referred. And it becomes to compute the estimated model in all correspondences.\nThe goal is to keep the model with the highest number of matches and the main problem is the number of times you have to repeat the process to obtain the best estimate of the model.\nRANSAC set in advance the number of iterations of the algorithm.\nTo specify scenes or objects, is commonly used affine transformations to perform the spatial verification.\nSection::::Methods.:Generalized Hough transform (GHT).\nThis is a technique for detecting shapes in digital images that solves the veracity of space by clusters of points belonging to the model through a voting procedure on a set of parametric figures.\nNot all possible combinations comprovar characteristics by adjusting a model for every possible subset, so that the voting technique, in which a vote is stored for each possible line in which each point is used. Then observe what were the lines with the most votes and those are selected.\nIf we use the local characteristics of scale, rotation and translation invariant, each feature coincidence gives a hypothesis alignment for scaling, translation and orientation of the model in the picture.\nOne hypothesis generated by a single match can be unreliable, so for each match (match), a vote is done to get a stronger hypothesis in the Hough space.\nSo we have two major phases:\nBULLET::::- \"Training\": For each characteristic model, 2D is saved the location, scale and orientation of the model.\nBULLET::::- \"Test\": each match is allowed to be performed by the algorithm SIFT and model characteristics vote in the Hough space."], "wikipedia-3525653": ["Verification involves design rule check (DRC), layout versus schematic (LVS), XOR (exclusive OR), antenna checks and electrical rule check (ERC).\nSection::::Design rule check (DRC).\nDRC verifies that the layout meets all technology-imposed constraints. DRC also verifies layer density for chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP).\nSection::::Layout versus schematic (LVS).\nLVS verifies the functionality of the design. From the layout, a netlist is derived and compared with the original netlist produced from logic synthesis or circuit design.\nSection::::XOR check.\nThis check is typically run after a metal spin, where the original and modified database are compared. This is done to confirm that the desired modifications have been made and no undesired modifications have been made by accident. This step involves comparing the two layout databases/GDS by XOR operation of the layout geometries. This check results a database which has all the mismatching geometries in both the layouts.\nSection::::Antenna check.\nThe antenna basically is a metal interconnect, i.e., a conductor like polysilicon or metal, that is not electrically connected to silicon or grounded, during the processing steps of the wafer. During the manufacturing process charge accumulation can occur on the antenna during certain fabrication steps like Plasma etching, which uses highly ionized matter to etch. If the connection to silicon does not exist, charges may build up on the interconnect to the point at which rapid discharge does take place and permanent physical damage results to thin transistor gate oxide. This rapid and destructive phenomenon is known as the antenna effect. Antenna errors can be cured by adding a small antenna diode to safely discharge the node or splitting the antenna by routing up to another metal layer and then down again.\nThe antenna ratio is defined as the ratio between the physical area of the conductors making up the antenna to the total gate oxide area to which the antenna is electrically connected.\nSection::::Electrical rule check (ERC).\nERC verifies the correctness of power and ground connections, and that signal transition times (slew), capacitive loads and fanouts are appropriately bounded. This might include checking for\nBULLET::::- Well and substrate areas for proper contacts and spacings thereby ensuring correct power and ground connections\nBULLET::::- Unconnected inputs or shorted outputs.\nGates should not connect directly to supplies; connection should be through TIE high/low cells only.\nERC checks are based upon assumptions about the normal operating conditions of the ASIC, so they may give many false warning on ASICs with multiple or negative supplies.\nThey can also check for structures susceptible to electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The name \"Bajrang\" is a reference to the Hindu deity Hanuman.\nThe Bajrang Dal's slogan is 'Sev\u0101 Surak\u1e63\u0101 Sansk\u1e5bti' or \"service, safety and culture.\" One of the main goals of the Dal is to build the Ramjanmabhoomi temple in Ayodhya, the Krishnajanmabhoomi temple in Mathura and the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi, which are currently disputed places of worship. Other goals include protecting India's \"Hindu\" identity from the perceived dangers of communism, Muslim demographic growth, and Christian conversion, as well as the prevention of cow slaughter."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This mechanism works by asking websites owners to publish on their website an \u201cassets\u201d file that contains a list of apps that can be legitimately associated with it. In this case, each app is identified by its package name and by the hash of its legitimate signing key.

The Autofill framework requires the developer to create an app that implements an Autofill Service, which allows filling out forms by injecting data directly into the views, such as theEditText widgets that store the credentials. To use that, the app needs to require the BIND_AUTOFILL_SERVICE permission. Android Oreo has also introduced some new XML attributes to assist password managers: importantForAutofill, which specifies whether the view is autofillable, autofillHints, which is a list of strings that suggests to the service what data to fill the view with, and autofillType, which tells the Autofill Service the type of data it expects to receive. Through these attributes, an app implementing an Autofill service is able to detect, classify, and fill form fields according to their types (e.g., username, email address, password). Note that an app that wants to be \u201ccompatible\u201d with the Autofill Framework must use these XML attributes. Note also that only one Autofill service can be active at the same time (the user can select which one to use through a dedicated setting menu).

Nowadays, web phishing is significantly more challenging than mobile phishing. On the web, the user can clearly see which website she is interacting with: she has the chance to check the domain name, whether the connection is done via HTTPS, and whether there is a valid SSL certificate. In the mobile world, however, there are no such indicators. In fact, as previous works have pointed out [8, 9, 36], there is currently no \u201cgreen lock\u201d or any space for any trusted indicator: these previous works have shown that a malicious app spoofing the Facebook UI can be made indistinguishable from the legitimate Facebook app\u2014even for a security-savvy user. The key requirement for these pixel-perfect attacks is the ability to control all the pixels on the screen. A website cannot achieve that, but an attacker can use Instant Apps to do just that: gain code execution on the device outside the browser\u2019s JavaScript sandbox and gain the ability to fully control the UI (without requesting any permission).\n\nOnce the attacker has gained full UI control, there are many possibilities. One first example is that the Instant App could resemble the real Facebook app, which can be made indistinguishable from the legitimate one. A second example would be to resemble the browser app itself : as the attacker controls every pixel of the screen, nothing prevents her from showing the user a browser-like view with a spoofed facebook.com domain name and a green lock. Once again, this attack can be made indistinguishable from a legitimate scenario."], "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/27": ["Secure mapping. The safest way to implement a mapping consists in securely verifying whether the developers of the current app have authority over a given domain name: if that is the case, then it is safe to auto-suggest the credentials of such domain name to the current app. One known solution to achieve this mapping is called Digital Asset Links [17] (DAL from now on). From a conceptual point of view, DAL allows for the definition of authentication domain equivalence classes, and it makes it possible to associate an app with a website and vice versa, via verifiable statements. This mechanism works by asking websites owners to publish on their website an \u201cassets\u201d file that contains a list of apps that can be legitimately associated with it. In this case, each app is identified by its package name and by the hash of its legitimate signing key. A third-party can then verify that an app is indeed legitimately linked to a website by checking whether the \u201cassets\u201d include a matching package name and the hash of the signing key.\nStatic one-to-one mapping. Consider a PM with a static one-to-one mapping, which maps one package name to exactly one domain name, and vice versa. As an example, consider the legitimate Facebook app, whose package name is com.facebook.katana, which is usually mapped to the facebook.com domain name. This simple mapping technique is vulnerable: in fact, Facebook credentials are suggested to any app whose package name is com.facebook.katana, even if the app is not the legitimate one. It would be possible to prevent this vulnerability by checking the certificate that signed the target app, and make sure it is one of the known, trusted one. Unfortunately, maintaining such list of known trusted certificates is a very challenging task.

Since credentials are created for websites, we argue this is a better abstraction level. In stark difference concerning existing proposals, this API, called getVerifiedDomainNames(), would directly provide to password managers a list of domain names that a given app is legitimately associated to. The API internal implementation would then be responsible for performing all the needed security checks. We envision this API to be used following the paradigm of OpenYOLO (as in Figure 2). The main difference is that password managers would directly query for domain names, and not for package names. Integration and implementation. The request for auto-filling a form follows several steps. First, the client sends an Intent to the password manager to request credentials. Then, the password manager can invoke getVerifiedDomainNames(), passing the received Intent as argument. At this point, our API performs a number of steps, whose sequence diagram is depicted in Figure 4. First, it retrieves the sender\u2019s package name from the Intent. The package name is used to extract the client\u2019s app signing key. Then, getVerifiedDomainNames() extracts from the client\u2019s manifest file the list of domain names the app claims to have access to (this list should be specified according to the standard App Link Verification [27] and Digital Asset Links [17] protocols).

The rationale capture procedure normally applied in the simulation/execution activity of the evolving design uses two phases: Phase I describes the problem and Phase II develops a solution strategy.\nDesign is an iterative procedure involving partitioning, classification/specification, assembly, simulation, and re-partitioning activities, see Figure. First, the design is partitioned into design artifacts. Each artifact is either classified against existing design artifacts or an external specification is developed for it. The external specification enables the internal specification of the design artifact to be delegated and performed concurrently. After classification/specification, the interfaces between the design artifacts are specified in\nthe assembly activity (i.e., static, dynamic, and behavioral models detailing different aspects of the interaction between design artifacts are developed). While the models are developed, it is important to simulate use scenarios or use cases between design artifacts to uncover design flaws. By analyzing these flaws, the designer can re-arrange the existing models and simulate them until the designer is satisfied. The observed design flaws and the actions contemplated and taken for each are the basis of the design rationale capture procedure.\nBULLET::::- Identify Problems\nThe designer identifies problems in the current design state by stepping through the use cases in the requirements model to validate that the design satisfies requirements and to verify that the design will function as intended. The designer records symptoms or concerns about the current design state. A symptom is an observation of an operational failure or undesirable condition in the existing design. A concern is an observation of an anticipated failure or undesirable condition in the existing design.\nBULLET::::- Identify Constraints\nThe designer then identifies the constraints that the problems violate or potentially violate. These constraints include requirements, goals, physical laws, conventions, assumptions, models, and resources. Because the activities and processes in the use case scenarios map to requirements and goals, the failure of the design in any use case activity or process can be traced directly to requirements statements and goal statements.\nBULLET::::- Identify Needs\nThe designer then identifies the necessary conditions or needs for solving the problems. A need is a necessary condition that must be met if a particular problem or set of problems is to be solved. It is possible that the needs statement will have to describe the essentiality for relaxing requirements and goal constraints governing the design.\nBULLET::::- Formulate Goals and Requirements\nOnce the needs for the design transition have been identified, the designer formulates\nBULLET::::1. requirements that the solution must satisfy and\nBULLET::::2. goals that the solution should attempt to satisfy.\nA requirement is a constraint on either the functional, behavioral, physical, or method of development aspects of a solution. A design goal is a stated aim that the design structure and specifications must support.\nSection::::IDEF6 topics.:Formulate Solution Strategies.\nOnce the requirements and goals have been established, the design team formulates alternative strategies for exploration in the next major transition in the design. \nDesign strategies can be considered as \u201cmeta-plans\u201d for dealing with frequently occurring design situations. They can be viewed as methodizations or organizations of the primitive design activities identified above (i.e., partitioning, classification/specification, assembly, simulation, and re-partitioning). The three types of design strategies considered in the IDEF4 rationale component include:\nBULLET::::1. External-constraint-driven design\u2014Design carried out under situations where the goals, intentions, and requirements are not characterized well, much less defined. These situations often result when the designer is brought into the product development process too early.\nBULLET::::2. Characteristic-driven design\u2014Design in a closely controlled situation where strict accountability and proof of adequacy are rigidly enforced.

Nowadays, web phishing is significantly more challenging than mobile phishing. On the web, the user can clearly see which website she is interacting with: she has the chance to check the domain name, whether the connection is done via HTTPS, and whether there is a valid SSL certificate.

Due to these threats, Google has developed additional Android features so that apps do not need to have access to such powerful mechanism to implement their functionality. Since password managers are some of the most common and prominent use cases, Google has recently introduced the Autofill Framework.\nAutofill Framework. The Autofill Framework [20] has been introduced in Android Oreo. This framework offers to password managers apps a technical solution to implement their core functionality without requiring access to a11y. In particular, the Autofill Framework allows an app to 1) determine which app the user is interacting with, and 2) fill credential fields programmatically.\nThe Autofill framework requires the developer to create an app that implements an Autofill Service, which allows filling out forms by injecting data directly into the views, such as theEditText widgets that store the credentials. To use that, the app needs to require the BIND_AUTOFILL_SERVICE permission. Android Oreo has also introduced some new XML attributes to assist password managers: importantForAutofill, which specifies whether the view is autofillable, autofillHints, which is a list of strings that suggests to the service what data to fill the view with, and autofillType, which tells the Autofill Service the type of data it expects to receive. Through these attributes, an app implementing an Autofill service is able to detect, classify, and fill form fields according to their types (e.g., username, email address, password). Note that an app that wants to be \u201ccompatible\u201d with the Autofill Framework must use these XML attributes. Note also that only one Autofill service can be active at the same time (the user can select which one to use through a dedicated setting menu).\nAt run-time, when the user opens a supported app with a login form, the password manager is able to determine which app the user is interacting with (once again, through its package name) and it can offer the possibility to the user to automatically insert the corresponding credentials on her behalf.\nOpenYOLO. OpenYOLO (YOLO stands for \u201cYou Only Login Once\u201d) is a recently developed protocol, supported by Google partnering with Dashlane, and it is available as an open-source library [ 18]. OpenYOLO does not require neither a11y nor Autofill Framework, but it requires to modify each app that wants to support OpenYOLO-based PMs. This mechanism is constituted by two components: the client and the credential provider (the server). The client is a component that needs to be embedded in each app that wants to support this protocol (e.g., Facebook). The credential provider, instead, is used within the password manager itself, and it is in charge of providing information to the password manager about the requester app identity. At run-time, the client seamlessly interacts with the credential provider (via the Intent mechanism), which, with the cooperation of the password manager, then returns to the client a set of credentials, if available. The interaction between the two components is depicted in Figure 2."], "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/0": ["For example, we show it is possible to trick password managers into auto-suggesting credentials associated with arbitrary attacker-chosen websites.

We then checked how many websites already link themselves to an app: to our surprise, only 178 of them currently have an assetlinks.json compatible with the proposed solution, which is around 2%. This means that, to date, password managers developers do not have the necessary information to securely implement their functionality, even if they wanted to. One may then wonder how Google Smart Lock, which we found to be secure, implements such mapping.

In fact, the App Link Verification requires collaboration from websites owners, as they would need to upload the appropriate assets file to their website. To determine the readiness of the ecosystem to this mechanism, we first built a dataset of 8,821 domain names extracted from the password managers we have analyzed (given the source of this dataset, these domain names are guaranteed to have at least one login form, otherwise they would not be relevant to password managers).

They work as follows: the first time a user visits a website and inputs credentials in online forms, the PM stores such credentials on its backend and it maintains the association between the credentials and the domain name. When the user visits the same domain later on, the PM recognizes and verifies the domain, and it suggests the credentials to insert in the corresponding login form.\nThe increasing popularity of mobile apps acting as wrappers of their corresponding websites (e.g., email providers, online documents, social networks, home banking) has motivated the development of password managers for mobile devices. These are implemented as mobile apps, and they have the capability of helping managing and automatically filling user\u2019s credentials in other apps. Modern PM apps and browser extensions also provide advanced sync functionalities between app and website credentials.\nFor example, consider a user opening for the first time the Facebook app, which requires the users credentials: at this point, the PM identifies the app, determines which domain name this app is associated to (i.e., facebook.com), and checks whether it has credentials associated to it; if this is the case, it auto-suggests them to the user, who can thus authenticate herself with few clicks, without the need of manually inserting her credentials."], "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/36": ["Once the user selects a form, 1Password behaves differently with respect to the supporting methodology: on Autofill Framework, it shows a small windows bearing the imprint \u201cAutofill with 1Password\u201d.

Moreover, we have found that Keeper, Dashlane, and LastPass all implement various (vulnerable) heuristics, each of which misplaces trust in an app package name or other metadata.

To make it worse, we note that these attacks also work for websites for which an associated mobile app does not exist. These attacks effectively make mobile phishing more practical: differently than all previous works, the user is not even asked to type her credentials; the user is just asked to allow password managers to autofill the credentials on her behalf."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2. The query could be partially answered using Wikipedia, particularly for general concepts like credential inspection (e.g., authentication protocols), identification (e.g., credential types), and injection (e.g., security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or credential stuffing). However, Wikipedia may lack detailed, context-specific guidance (e.g., tools for ethical hacking or API credential injection), which would require specialized sources. Clarifying the context (e.g., cybersecurity, software development) would improve the answer's precision.", "wikipedia-35636420": ["Section::::Identification, authentication and authorization.:Identification.\nIt is a scheme established and maintained, whereby users are properly, consistently, effectively and efficiently identified before systems are accessed. An identity verification service is often employed to ensure that users or customers provide information that is associated with the identity of a real person. \nSection::::Identification, authentication and authorization.:Authentication.\nAuthentication is verification of the identity of the entity requesting access to a system. It is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it is declared to be. In private and public computer networks (including the Internet), authentication is commonly done through the use of logon passwords. Knowledge of the password is assumed to guarantee that the user is authentic. Each user registers initially (or is registered by someone else), using an assigned or self-declared password. On each subsequent use, the user must know and use the previously declared password. The weakness in this system for transactions that are significant (such as the exchange of money) is that passwords can often be stolen, accidentally revealed, or forgotten.\nFor this reason, Internet business and many other transactions require a more stringent authentication process. The use of digital certificates issued and verified by a Certificate Authority (CA) as part of a public key infrastructure is considered likely to become the standard way to perform authentication on the Internet. \nLogically, authentication precedes authorization (although they may often seem to be combined).\nSection::::Identification, authentication and authorization.:Authorization.\nAuthorization is the process of giving someone permission to do or have something. In multi-user computer systems, a system administrator defines for the system which users are allowed access to the system and what privileges of use (such as access to which file directories, hours of access, amount of allocated storage space, and so forth). Assuming that someone has logged into a computer operating system or application, the system or application may want to identify what resources the user can be given during this session. Thus, authorization is sometimes seen as both the preliminary setting up of permissions by a system administrator and the actual checking of the permission values that have been set up when a user is getting access. Logically, authorization is preceded by authentication. ).\nSection::::Types of ecommerce authentication.\nBULLET::::- One-time password/Single sign on - It is process where a user\u2019s password and information is used for logon and then, becomes invalid after a set time.\nBULLET::::- Two-factor authentication - This requires two forms of authentication before access can be granted to a user.\nBULLET::::- Multi-factor authentication - Multi-factor authentication requires that the user uses a user id, password combined with any other form of authentication method as smartcard or biometric. Using this method decreases the likelihood that an unauthorized person can compromise your electronic security system, but it also increases the cost of maintaining that system.\nBULLET::::- Electronic access card/Smart card - Smart card are credit card-sized plastic cards that house an embedded integrated circuit. They can be used in electronic commerce for providing personal security, stored value and mobility. At the functional level, smart cards can be categorised as either memory cards or microprocessor cards. Memory cards, such as disposable pre-paid payphone cards or loyalty card, are the most cheapest form of smart card. They contain a small amount of memory in the form of ROM (read only memory) and EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read only memory). Microprocessor cards are more advanced than simple memory cards in that they contain a microprocessor CPU (central processing unit) and RAM (random access memory) in addition to ROM and EEPROM. The ROM contains the card's operating system and factory-loaded applications.\nBULLET::::- Security token - It is an authentication device that has been assigned to a specific user by an appropriate administrator\u201d. It uses what the user has such as, Passport, driver\u2019s license etc. to identify them. \u201cMost security tokens also incorporate two-factor authentication methods to work effectively\u201d.\nBULLET::::- Keystroke dynamics - It is an automated form of authentication based on something the user does. It authenticates the user based keyboard typing pattern.\nBULLET::::- Biometric - Biometric based systems enable the automatic identification and/or authentication of individuals. Authentication answers the question: \"Am I who I claim to be?\". The system verifies the identity of the person by processing biometric data, which refers to the person who asks and takes a yes/no decision (1:1 comparison). On the other hand, identification answers to the question: \"Who am I?\". The system recognizes the individual who asks by distinguishing him from other persons whose biometric data is also stored in the database. In this case the system takes a l-of-n decision, and answers that the person who asks is X, if her/his biometric data is stored in the database or that there is no match at all. Although the identification function should be regarded as distinct from authentication from an application perspective, often systems using biometrics integrate both identification and authentication functions, since the former is a repetitive execution of the latter."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This simple mapping technique is vulnerable: in fact, Facebook credentials are suggested to any app whose package name is com.facebook.katana, even if the app is not the legitimate one. It would be possible to prevent this vulnerability by checking the certificate that signed the target app, and make sure it is one of the known, trusted one.

In fact, the App Link Verification requires collaboration from websites owners, as they would need to upload the appropriate assets file to their website. To determine the readiness of the ecosystem to this mechanism, we first built a dataset of 8,821 domain names extracted from the password managers we have analyzed (given the source of this dataset, these domain names are guaranteed to have at least one login form, otherwise they would not be relevant to password managers). We then checked how many websites already link themselves to an app: to our surprise, only 178 of them currently have an assetlinks.json compatible with the proposed solution, which is around 2%. This means that, to date, password managers developers do not have the necessary information to securely implement their functionality, even if they wanted to. One may then wonder how Google Smart Lock, which we found to be secure, implements such mapping.

Webster's defines a beneficial owner as \"one who enjoys the benefit of a property of which another is the legal owner.\" The legal owner (i.e. the owner on the record) may be described as the \"registered owner\", and if they are not the beneficial owner they may be described as a \"nominee\".\n\nIn jurisdictions that permit it, actual owners may establish shell corporations to be the legal owners of their ships, making it difficult, if not impossible, to track who is the beneficial owner of the ship. The 2004 Report of the UN Secretary General\u2019s Consultative Group on Flag State Implementation reported that \"It is very easy, and comparatively inexpensive, to establish a complex web of corporate entities to provide very effective cover to the identities of beneficial owners who do not want to be known.\" \n\nAccording to a 2003 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) titled \"Ownership and Control of Ships\", these corporate structures are often multi-layered, spread across numerous jurisdictions, and make the beneficial owner \"almost impenetrable\" to law enforcement officials and taxation. The report concludes that \"regardless of the reasons why the cloak of anonymity is made available, if it is provided it will also assist those who may wish to remain hidden because they engage in illegal or criminal activities, including terrorists.\" The OECD report concludes that the use of bearer shares is \"perhaps the single most important (and perhaps the most widely used) mechanism\" to protect the anonymity of a ship's beneficial owner. Physically possessing a bearer share accords ownership of the corporation. There is no requirement for reporting the transfer of bearer shares, and not every jurisdiction requires that their serial numbers even be recorded.\n\nTwo similar techniques to provide anonymity for a ship's beneficial owner are \"nominee shareholders\" and \"nominee directors.\" In some jurisdictions that require shareholder identities to be reported, a loophole may exist where the beneficial owner may appoint a nominee to be the shareholder, and that nominee cannot legally be compelled to reveal the identity of the beneficial owner. All corporations are required to have at least one director, however many jurisdictions allow this to be a nominee director. A nominee director's name would appear on all corporate paperwork in place of the beneficial owners, and like nominee shareholders, few jurisdictions can compel a nominee director to divulge the identity of beneficial owners.

When the user opens an app that can be auto-filled, Keeper obtains its package name, through a11y or Autofill Framework. Keeper then needs to determine which website is associated with the current package name. To this aim, Keeper builds a heuristic-based mapping as follows: it uses the app package name to infer the URL of the app webpage on the Play Store (e.g., when the user opens the Facebook app, whose package name iscom.facebook.katana, Keeper tries to access the webpage at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?gl=us&id=com.facebook.katana ). Then, if the webpage exists, Keeper parses out the domain name of the URL specified in the \u201capp developer website field. \u201d This is the domain name that Keeper considers as the rightful owner, and it then stores the package name \u2192domain name association in its internal mapping database. Finally, Keeper auto-suggests the credentials associated with this just-retrieved domain name.\nExploitation. Unfortunately, this mechanism is trivial to exploit for an attacker. In fact, the app developer URL is not validated by the Play Store and it thus cannot be trusted. We were able to create an app (with an arbitrary package name) and to publish it on the Play Store specifying facebook.com as the developer\u2019s website. In this way, when a user opens our app, the Facebook credentials (and only these credentials) are suggested."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-36033173": 1, "wikipedia-43703280": 1, "wikipedia-10873260": 1, "wikipedia-21242339": 1, "wikipedia-4746507": 1, "wikipedia-17457007": 1, "wikipedia-535811": 1, "wikipedia-25671719": 1, "wikipedia-2929629": 1, "wikipedia-4732658": 1, "arxiv-1607.03182": 1, "arxiv-1904.09350": 1, "arxiv-1902.01520": 1, "arxiv-1701.00925": 1, "arxiv-2405.09917": 1, "arxiv-2411.05090": 1, "arxiv-2207.12851": 1, "arxiv-2312.05274": 1, "arxiv-2201.03519": 1, "arxiv-cs/0703017": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/30": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/36": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/32": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/26": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/28": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/46": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/29": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/27": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/11": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-36033173": 1, "wikipedia-43703280": 1, "wikipedia-10873260": 1, "wikipedia-21242339": 1, "wikipedia-4746507": 1, "wikipedia-17457007": 1, "wikipedia-535811": 1, "wikipedia-25671719": 1, "wikipedia-2929629": 1, "wikipedia-4732658": 1, "arxiv-1607.03182": 1, "arxiv-1904.09350": 1, "arxiv-1902.01520": 1, "arxiv-1701.00925": 1, "arxiv-2405.09917": 1, "arxiv-2411.05090": 1, "arxiv-2207.12851": 1, "arxiv-2312.05274": 1, "arxiv-2201.03519": 1, "arxiv-cs/0703017": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/30": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/36": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/6": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/32": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/26": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/28": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/46": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/29": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/27": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/11": 1}}}

Internally, this new API relies on an existing technical solution based on Digital Asset Links [17] verification. This solution requires websites owners to publish an \u201cassets\u201d file on their website so that an app-website \u201clink\u201d can be established.

Unfortunately, although we believe that this solution is technically sound, the current ecosystem is far from being ready. In fact, the App Link Verification requires collaboration from websites owners, as they would need to upload the appropriate assets file to their website. To determine the readiness of the ecosystem to this mechanism, we first built a dataset of 8,821 domain names extracted from the password managers we have analyzed (given the source of this dataset, these domain names are guaranteed to have at least one login form, otherwise they would not be relevant to password managers). We then checked how many websites already link themselves to an app: to our surprise, only 178 of them currently have an assetlinks.json compatible with the proposed solution, which is around 2%. This means that, to date, password managers developers do not have the necessary information to securely implement their functionality, even if they wanted to. One may then wonder how Google Smart Lock, which we found to be secure, implements such mapping.

The safest way to implement a mapping consists in securely verifying whether the developers of the current app have authority over a given domain name: if that is the case, then it is safe to auto-suggest the credentials of such domain name to the current app. One known solution to achieve this mapping is called Digital Asset Links [17] (DAL from now on). From a conceptual point of view, DAL allows for the definition of authentication domain equivalence classes, and it makes it possible to associate an app with a website and vice versa, via verifiable statements. This mechanism works by asking websites owners to publish on their website an \u201cassets\u201d file that contains a list of apps that can be legitimately associated with it. In this case, each app is identified by its package name and by the hash of its legitimate signing key.

However, this procedure is not fully automated, and developers are requested to fill a Google Form manually and to provide a set of information. We argue that such a process hardly scales, as it is centralized and it requires the manual intervention of the developer.

We then checked how many websites already link themselves to an app: to our surprise, only 178 of them currently have an assetlinks.json compatible with the proposed solution, which is around 2%. This means that, to date, password managers developers do not have the necessary information to securely implement their functionality, even if they wanted to. One may then wonder how Google Smart Lock, which we found to be secure, implements such mapping.

Such vulnerabilities are considered \"catastrophic\" by security analysts.\nSection::::Speculative execution vulnerabilities.\nStarting in 2017 a series of security vulnerabilities were found in the implementations of speculative execution on common processor architectures which effectively enabled an elevation of privileges. It was possible to mitigate these flaws with changes to microcode.\nThese include:\nBULLET::::- Spectre\nBULLET::::- Meltdown\nBULLET::::- SPOILER\nBULLET::::- Foreshadow\nBULLET::::- Microarchitectural Data Sampling\nSection::::Intel VISA.\nIn 2019 researchers discovered that a manufacturer debugging mode, known as VISA, had an undocumented feature on Intel Platform Controller Hubs, which are the chipsets included on most Intel-based motherboards and which have direct memory access, which made the mode accessible with a normal motherboard possibly leading to a security vulnerability."], "wikipedia-7398": ["A vulnerability is a weakness in design, implementation, operation or internal control. Most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. An \"exploitable\" vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or \"exploit\" exists. Vulnerabilities are often hunted or exploited with the aid of automated tools or manually using customized scripts.\n\nA backdoor in a computer system, a cryptosystem or an algorithm, is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls. They may exist for a number of reasons, including by original design or from poor configuration. They may have been added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access, or by an attacker for malicious reasons; but regardless of the motives for their existence, they create a vulnerability.\n\nDenial of service attacks (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victims account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points \u2013 and defending is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet, but a range of other techniques are possible including reflection and amplification attacks, where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim.\n\nAn unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer is most likely able to directly copy data from it. They may also compromise security by making operating system modifications, installing software worms, keyloggers, covert listening devices or using wireless mice. Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be able to be by-passed by booting another operating system or tool from a CD-ROM or other bootable media. Disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module are designed to prevent these attacks.\n\nEavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private conversation, typically between hosts on a network. For instance, programs such as Carnivore and NarusInSight have been used by the FBI and NSA to eavesdrop on the systems of internet service providers. Even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact to the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint electromagnetic transmissions generated by the hardware; TEMPEST is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks.\n\nSurfacing in 2017, a new class of multi-vector, polymorphic cyber threats surfaced that combined several types of attacks and changed form to avoid cyber security controls as they spread. These threats have been classified as fifth generation cyber attacks.\n\nPhishing is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details directly from users. Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. The fake website often ask for personal information, such as log-in and passwords. This information can then be used to gain access to the individual's real account on the real website. Preying on a victim's trust, phishing can be classified as a form of social engineering.\n\nPrivilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to, without authorization, elevate their privileges or access level. For example, a standard computer user may be able to exploit a vulnerability in the system to gain access to restricted data; or even become \"root\" and have full unrestricted access to a system.\n\nSocial engineering aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords, card numbers, etc. by, for example, impersonating a bank, a contractor, or a customer. A common scam involves fake CEO emails sent to accounting and finance departments. In early 2016, the FBI reported that the scam has cost US businesses more than $2bn in about two years. In May 2016, the Milwaukee Bucks NBA team was the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the team's president Peter Feigin, resulting in the handover of all the team's employees' 2015 W-2 tax forms.\n\nSpoofing is the act of masquerading as a valid entity through falsification of data (such as an IP address or username), in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain. There are several types of spoofing, including:\n- Email spoofing, where an attacker forges the sending (\"From\", or source) address of an email.\n- IP address spoofing, where an attacker alters the source IP address in a network packet to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system.\n- MAC spoofing, where an attacker modifies the Media Access Control (MAC) address of their network interface to pose as a valid user on a network.\n- Biometric spoofing, where an attacker produces a fake biometric sample to pose as another user.\n\nTampering describes a malicious modification of products. So-called \"Evil Maid\" attacks and security services planting of surveillance capability into routers are examples."], "wikipedia-54427559": ["VoIP vulnerabilities\nVoIP is vulnerable to similar types of attacks that Web connection and emails are prone to. VoIP attractiveness, because of its low fixed cost and numerous features, come with some risks that are well known to the developers an are constantly being addressed. But these risks are usually not mentioned to the business which is the most common target.\nVoIP also allows the use of fraud and shady practices that most people are not aware of. And while this practices are restricted by most providers, the possibility that someone is using them for their own gain still exists.\n\nSection::::Vulnerabilities.\nSection::::Vulnerabilities.:Remote eavesdropping.\nUnencrypted connections lead to communication and security breaches. Hackers/trackers can eavesdrops on important or private conversations and extract valuable data. The overheard conversations might be sold to or used by competing businesses. The gathered intelligence can also be used as blackmail for personal gain.\n\nSection::::Vulnerabilities.:Network attacks.\nAttacks to the user network, or internet provider can disrupt or even cut the connection. Since VOIP is highly dependent on our internet connection, direct attacks on the internet connection, or provider, are highly effective way of attack. This kind of attacks are targeting office telephony, since mobile internet is harder to interrupt. Also mobile applications not relying on internet connection to make VOIP calls. are immune to such attacks.\n\nSection::::Vulnerabilities.:Default security settings.\nHardphones (a.k.a. VoIP phone) are smart devices, they are more a computer than a phone, and as such they need to be well configured. The Chinese manufacturers, in some cases are using default passwords for each of the manufactured devices leading to vulnerabilities.\n\nSection::::Vulnerabilities.:VOIP over WiFi.\nVoIP even while VoIP is relatively secure in 2017, it still needs a source of internet, which in most cases is WIFI network. And while a home/office WIFI can be relatively secure, using public or shared networks will further compromise the connection.\n\nSection::::VOIP exploits.\nSection::::VOIP exploits.:VoIP spam.\nVoip has its own spam called SPIT (Spam over Internet Telephony). Using the unlimited extensions provided by VOIP PBX capabilities, the spammer can constantly harass his target from different numbers. The process is not hard to automate and can fill the targets voice mail with notifications. The caller can make calls often enough to block the target from getting important incoming calls. This practices can cost a lot to the caller and are rarely used for other than marketing needs.\n\nSection::::VOIP exploits.:VoIP phishing.\nVOIP users can change their Caller ID (a.k.a. Caller ID spoofing), allowing caller to represent himself as relative, colleague, or part of the family, in order to extract information, money or benefits form the target."], "wikipedia-17079365": ["In April 2010 following experiments showing the potential vulnerabilities of implantable technology, Gasson's team demonstrated how a computer virus could wirelessly infect his implant and then be transmitted on to other systems. Gasson drew parallels with other implantable devices such as cardiac pacemakers which he asserted were vulnerable because of a tendency of manufacturers to adopt a \"security through obscurity\" methodology rather than robust security methods. He also argued that as functions of the body are restored or enhanced by implanted devices, the boundaries of the body (the human experience of the body\u2019s delimitation) become increasingly unclear and the separation between man and machine simply becomes theoretical, meaning that the technology becomes perceived by the human as being a part of their body and so should be considered as such. He argues that this development in our traditional notion of what constitutes our body and its boundaries has two notable repercussions: Firstly it becomes possible to talk in terms of a human (albeit a technologically enhanced human) becoming for instance infected by a computer virus or hacked by a third party. This forms the basis of his claim to be the first human infected by a computer virus. Secondly, this development of our concept of the body impacts on human rights, in particular the right to bodily integrity - in most legal systems the right to bodily integrity will be considered a vital fundamental right."], "wikipedia-6350461": ["As discussed by many experts, including a project manager at the Center for Public Integrity and a research fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, security was the largest threat to the SERVE program. These security risks were put to the test in 2010 when J. Alex Halderman, a professor of Computer Science at the University of Michigan, took on a challenge issued by the District of Columbia to see if Halderman's students could hack SERVE. Halderman's Computer Science students were quickly successful in hacking this voting system. The students not only managed to disable the system but also were able to add votes, change votes, and manipulate the program so that once voters cast their ballots, the University of Michigan fight song would play. These hacking results were immediately turned over to the SERVE system team in order to strengthen the security wall of the program. In the end, the SERVE experiment was decidedly terminated as the security risks were deemed too high and the threats of fraud and corruption were undeniable. The implications of the students' capabilities to break through the security wall of a highly advanced system to alter and change votes for elections illustrates the intense impacts that Internet hackers could potentially have on an internet voting system.\n\nIn order to accurately assess SERVE's security, professionals from various backgrounds conducted an analysis. These four individuals \u2013 as shown on the first page of the report \u2013 critiqued the weaknesses SERVE showed and narrated their findings in this report. A summary of their findings is as follows. The report first discussed the likelihood that cyber-attacks would succeed against SERVE; as well as to what extent an event such as a hacker breakthrough could compromise an election. The report states that, \"the software of SERVE is totally closed and proprietary,\" an inadequate inspection of SERVE before its launch allowed it \"to be vulnerable to various forms of programmer attacks\". This is critical information in the voting world. According to the report, a potential hack into SERVE \"could result in large-scale, selective voter disenfranchisement, and/or privacy violation, and/or vote buying and selling, and/or vote switching even to the extent of reversing the outcome of many elections at once\". This means that if SERVE is implemented, elections as important as the Presidential could be completely fraudulent without any trace of a culprit. Finally, it was the critics' place to suggest any potential solutions that could remedy SERVE's vulnerabilities. Their report states, \"that the vulnerabilities described cannot be fixed by design changes or bug fixes to SERVE,\" it explains that, \"the vulnerabilities are fundamental in the architecture of the Internet and of the PC hardware and software that is ubiquitous today\" . The final thoughts of the report express that SERVE, as it is now, is impractical for this time, and does not contain the necessary security features to serve its purpose successfully. The report claims that, \"there really is no good way to build such a voting system without a radical change in overall architecture of the Internet or some unforeseen security breakthrough\"."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. **Yes**\n\n2.

In the realm ofmobile devices, there have been a number of works focusing ontask hijacking [9, 14, 36], and UI confusion [4, 8]. We built on theinsights provided by these works and we have shown how featuresimplemented for convenience can make mobile phishing attackssignificantly more practical than what previously thought: we donot assume a malicious app is already running on the victim\u2019s de-vice and, for the first time, the user is not even required to type hercredentials. Few works also proposed defense mechanisms for mo-bile phishing [8, 15], which are unfortunately not finding adoptiondue to the invasive framework modifications they require. Anotherinteresting research direction is the automatic identification of appwidgets that contain user\u2019s sensitive info [7, 28, 34].\n\nAnother class of UI-related attacks is tapjacking (also called click-jacking). Some works have shown how an attacker can abuse theoverlay system to lure users into unknowingly perform security-sensitive operations [16, 35, 39]. Other works show how accessibil-ity service can be abused to bypass user interaction and performUI-related attacks [5, 6, 16, 29, 32, 33, 38]. These are very powerfulattacks, but they differ from phishing: they are about luring a userto perform a sensitive operation, while phishing focuses on luringthem to leak their credentials.\n\nA few recent works have focused on the security analysis ofbrowser password managers [31? ]. In those works, the authors con-duct a security analysis of popular web-based password managers,and some of them were found exploitable, allowing an attacker toleak user credentials. The root-causes of the vulnerabilities wereranging from logic and authorization mistakes to traditional webvulnerabilities like CSRF and XSS. Our work, instead, focuses onmobile password managers. We also note that we have not focusedon identifying classic implementation bugs, but we aimed at uncov-ering systemic design issues.\n\nSilver et al. show several attacks aimed at retrieving passwordsfrom in-browser PMs, by exploiting their autofill policies [? ]; themost powerful attack they uncovered does not require any humanintervention and it allows to automatically auto-complete passwordfields. Several prior works show how combining innocuous visi-ble fields and sensitive invisible fields trigger PMs to autofill, and,consequently, provide sensitive information to the attacker [? ? ].This is similar to our experiment with hidden password EditTextwidgets.\n\nFor what concern the security of Android password managers,the work by Fahl et al. is one of the few in the area [ 13]: in thispaper, the authors studied 21 popular password managers and showhow password managers would somehow push users to \u201ccopy\u201d theirpasswords to their clipboard: this has security implications since thedevice clipboard can be accessed by any app installed on the user\u2019sdevice. Interestingly, we note that password managers using a11yor Autofill Service are not affected by these problems: passwordsshared via these \u201cmodern\u201d features do not go through the clipboard.However, our paper, unfortunately, shows that even these modernmechanisms are affected by security problems as well."], "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/43": ["We have carried out further experiments with the aim of assessing whether current mobile password managers are vulnerable to automatically filling hidden fields.

This is similar to what previous research has attempted with web-based password managers [? ]: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that these attacks work with mobile password managers as well.

This solution requires websites owners to publish an \u201cassets\u201d file on their website so that an app-website \u201clink\u201d can be established. This is the same mechanism that Autofill Framework and OpenYOLO suggest developers to use: the difference is that our API forces them to use it, instead of leaving them open to implement vulnerable solutions\u2014as they did. Unfortunately, although we believe that this solution is technically sound, the current ecosystem is far from being ready. In fact, the App Link Verification requires collaboration from websites owners, as they would need to upload the appropriate assets file to their website. To determine the readiness of the ecosystem to this mechanism, we first built a dataset of 8,821 domain names extracted from the password managers we have analyzed (given the source of this dataset, these domain names are guaranteed to have at least one login form, otherwise they would not be relevant to password managers). We then checked how many websites already link themselves to an app: to our surprise, only 178 of them currently have an assetlinks.json compatible with the proposed solution, which is around 2%. This means that, to date, password managers developers do not have the necessary information to securely implement their functionality, even if they wanted to. One may then wonder how Google Smart Lock, which we found to be secure, implements such mapping. We found that, although a technical solution exists, this process is not automatic: according to the official documentation [23], the last step of the process requires developers to manually fill a Google Form [26] to provide the needed information. We conclude that the adoption of a secure mapping cannot be easily addressed by the single actors alone, but it requires a community-wide effort, which this work hopes to inspire."], "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/0": ["Modern versions of Android have introduced a number of features in the name of convenience.

They may exist for a number of reasons, including by original design or from poor configuration. They may have been added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access, or by an attacker for malicious reasons; but regardless of the motives for their existence, they create a vulnerability.\nSection::::Vulnerabilities and attacks.:Denial-of-service attack.\nDenial of service attacks (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victims account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points \u2013 and defending is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet, but a range of other techniques are possible including reflection and amplification attacks, where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim.\nSection::::Vulnerabilities and attacks.:Direct-access attacks.\nAn unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer is most likely able to directly copy data from it. They may also compromise security by making operating system modifications, installing software worms, keyloggers, covert listening devices or using wireless mice. Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be able to be by-passed by booting another operating system or tool from a CD-ROM or other bootable media. Disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module are designed to prevent these attacks.\nSection::::Vulnerabilities and attacks.:Eavesdropping.\nEavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private conversation, typically between hosts on a network. For instance, programs such as Carnivore and NarusInSight have been used by the FBI and NSA to eavesdrop on the systems of internet service providers. Even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact to the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint electromagnetic transmissions generated by the hardware; TEMPEST is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks.\nSection::::Vulnerabilities and attacks.:Multi-vector, polymorphic attacks.\nSurfacing in 2017, a new class of multi-vector, polymorphic cyber threats surfaced that combined several types of attacks and changed form to avoid cyber security controls as they spread. These threats have been classified as fifth generation cyber attacks.\nSection::::Vulnerabilities and attacks.:Phishing.\nPhishing is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details directly from users. Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. The fake website often ask for personal information, such as log-in and passwords. This information can then be used to gain access to the individual's real account on the real website. Preying on a victim's trust, phishing can be classified as a form of social engineering.\nSection::::Vulnerabilities and attacks.:Privilege escalation.\nPrivilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to, without authorization, elevate their privileges or access level. For example, a standard computer user may be able to exploit a vulnerability in the system to gain access to restricted data; or even become \"root\" and have full unrestricted access to a system.\nSection::::Vulnerabilities and attacks.:Social engineering.\nSocial engineering aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords, card numbers, etc. by, for example, impersonating a bank, a contractor, or a customer.\nA common scam involves fake CEO emails sent to accounting and finance departments. In early 2016, the FBI reported that the scam has cost US businesses more than $2bn in about two years.\nIn May 2016, the Milwaukee Bucks NBA team was the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the team's president Peter Feigin, resulting in the handover of all the team's employees' 2015 W-2 tax forms.\nSection::::Vulnerabilities and attacks.:Spoofing.\nSpoofing is the act of masquerading as a valid entity through falsification of data (such as an IP address or username), in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain. There are several types of spoofing, including:\nBULLET::::- Email spoofing, where an attacker forges the sending (\"From\", or source) address of an email.\nBULLET::::- IP address spoofing, where an attacker alters the source IP address in a network packet to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system.\nBULLET::::- MAC spoofing, where an attacker modifies the Media Access Control (MAC) address of their network interface to pose as a valid user on a network.\nBULLET::::- Biometric spoofing, where an attacker produces a fake biometric sample to pose as another user.\nSection::::Vulnerabilities and attacks.:Tampering.\nTampering describes a malicious modification of products.

Since VOIP is highly dependent on our internet connection, direct attacks on the internet connection, or provider, are highly effective way of attack. This kind of attacks are targeting office telephony, since mobile internet is harder to interrupt.

Using the unlimited extensions provided by VOIP PBX capabilities, the spammer can constantly harass his target from different numbers. The process is not hard to automate and can fill the targets voice mail with notifications. The caller can make calls often enough to block the target from getting important incoming calls. This practices can cost a lot to the caller and are rarely used for other than marketing needs.\nSection::::VOIP exploits.:VoIP phishing.\nVOIP users can change their Caller ID (a.k.a.

The Global Risks Report 2019 by the World Economic Forum, cited climate change among the most concerning issues. As part of the report a survey cited extreme weather, lack of climate action and natural disasters as the main three problems. The 2017 Global Catastrophic Risks report, issued by the Global Challenges Foundation, highlighted a broad range of security-related topics, among them climate change, and concluded that global warming has a high likelihood to end civilization.\n\nScholars analysing conflicts with a climate security rendering have long argued that climate change can adversely affect security and international stability. Recent reports convey the information of collapse of pastoral societies, how terrorist groups seek recruits in dehydrated lands, and how flooding ultimately fed anti-government sentiments. Unstable regions appear to be incapable of surviving climate change-related stresses; instead creating fertile soil for radicalisation, poverty and violent conflict. Scholars of climate security can analyse the chronological order of an escalation, where a changing environment or climate change can be an underlying variable. It is a complex interplay of many political and socio-economical factors where climate change is considered a risk- or threat-multiplier.\n\nClimate change has been identified as a threat multiplier, which can exacerbate existing threats. A 2013 meta-analysis of 60 previous peer-reviewed studies, and 45 data sets concluded that, \"climate change intensifies natural resource stresses in a way that can increase the likelihood of livelihood devastation, state fragility, human displacement, and mass death.\" The 2014 report, by the CNA Military Advisory Board, \"National Security and the Accelerating Risks of Climate Change\" re-examined the impact of climate change on U.S. national security. The report concluded that climate change is a growing security threat.\n\nIn the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), The Pentagon stated: \"The QDR will set a long-term course for DOD as it assesses the threats and challenges that the nation faces and re-balances DOD\u2019s strategies, capabilities, and forces to address today\u2019s conflicts and tomorrow\u2019s threats.\" and \" \"Climate change poses another significant challenge for the United States and the world at large. As greenhouse gas emissions increase, sea levels are rising, average global temperatures are increasing, and severe weather patterns are accelerating. These changes, coupled with other global dynamics, including growing, urbanizing, more affluent populations, and substantial economic growth in India, China, Brazil, and other nations, will devastate homes, land, and infrastructure. Climate change may exacerbate water scarcity and lead to sharp increases in food costs. The pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions around the world. These effects are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions \u2013 conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.\"\n\nA RAND Corporation blog noted in 2015, \"Climate change can affect conflict around the world in uncertain and complex ways, although we can't establish the magnitude of a causal relationship with confidence.

Mann stated in his commentary to the 2018 global heat wave that climate change is a national security nightmare.\n\nBased on reviewing 60 studies on the subject of climate change and conflicts, additional to warmer temperatures, more extreme rainfall could increase interpersonal violence by 4%, and intergroup conflict by 14% (median estimates).

This forms the basis of his claim to be the first human infected by a computer virus.

These security risks were put to the test in 2010 when J. Alex Halderman, a professor of Computer Science at the University of Michigan, took on a challenge issued by the District of Columbia to see if Halderman's students could hack SERVE. Halderman's Computer Science students were quickly successful in hacking this voting system. The students not only managed to disable the system but also were able to add votes, change votes, and manipulate the program so that once voters cast their ballots, the University of Michigan fight song would play. These hacking results were immediately turned over to the SERVE system team in order to strengthen the security wall of the program. In the end, the SERVE experiment was decidedly terminated as the security risks were deemed too high and the threats of fraud and corruption were undeniable. The implications of the students' capabilities to break through the security wall of a highly advanced system to alter and change votes for elections illustrates the intense impacts that Internet hackers could potentially have on an internet voting system.\n\nThe report first discussed the likelihood that cyber-attacks would succeed against SERVE; as well as to what extent an event such as a hacker breakthrough could compromise an election. The report states that, \"the software of SERVE is totally closed and proprietary,\" an inadequate inspection of SERVE before its launch allowed it \"to be vulnerable to various forms of programmer attacks\". This is critical information in the voting world. According to the report, a potential hack into SERVE \"could result in large-scale, selective voter disenfranchisement, and/or privacy violation, and/or vote buying and selling, and/or vote switching even to the extent of reversing the outcome of many elections at once\". This means that if SERVE is implemented, elections as important as the Presidential could be completely fraudulent without any trace of a culprit. Finally, it was the critics' place to suggest any potential solutions that could remedy SERVE's vulnerabilities. Their report states, \"that the vulnerabilities described cannot be fixed by design changes or bug fixes to SERVE,\" it explains that, \"the vulnerabilities are fundamental in the architecture of the Internet and of the PC hardware and software that is ubiquitous today\" . The final thoughts of the report express that SERVE, as it is now, is impractical for this time, and does not contain the necessary security features to serve its purpose successfully.

We built on theinsights provided by these works and we have shown how featuresimplemented for convenience can make mobile phishing attackssignificantly more practical than what previously thought: we donot assume a malicious app is already running on the victim\u2019s de-vice and, for the first time, the user is not even required to type hercredentials. Few works also proposed defense mechanisms for mo-bile phishing [8, 15], which are unfortunately not finding adoptiondue to the invasive framework modifications they require. Anotherinteresting research direction is the automatic identification of appwidgets that contain user\u2019s sensitive info [7, 28, 34].\n\nThe problem of phishing has also been extensively studied inthebrowser context [10, 11, 30]. In this context, protection mechanismsare usually implemented in forms of blacklist [25].\n\nAnother class of UI-related attacks is tapjacking (also called click-jacking). Some works have shown how an attacker can abuse theoverlay system to lure users into unknowingly perform security-sensitive operations [16, 35, 39]. Other works show how accessibil-ity service can be abused to bypass user interaction and performUI-related attacks [5, 6, 16, 29, 32, 33, 38]. These are very powerfulattacks, but they differ from phishing: they are about luring a userto perform a sensitive operation, while phishing focuses on luringthem to leak their credentials.\n\nA few recent works have focused on the security analysis ofbrowser password managers [31? ]. In those works, the authors con-duct a security analysis of popular web-based password managers,and some of them were found exploitable, allowing an attacker toleak user credentials. The root-causes of the vulnerabilities wereranging from logic and authorization mistakes to traditional webvulnerabilities like CSRF and XSS. Our work, instead, focuses onmobile password managers. We also note that we have not focusedon identifying classic implementation bugs, but we aimed at uncov-ering systemic design issues.\n\nSilver et al. show several attacks aimed at retrieving passwordsfrom in-browser PMs, by exploiting their autofill policies [? ]; themost powerful attack they uncovered does not require any humanintervention and it allows to automatically auto-complete passwordfields. Several prior works show how combining innocuous visi-ble fields and sensitive invisible fields trigger PMs to autofill, and,consequently, provide sensitive information to the attacker [? ? ].This is similar to our experiment with hidden password EditTextwidgets.\n\nFor what concern the security of Android password managers,the work by Fahl et al. is one of the few in the area [ 13]: in thispaper, the authors studied 21 popular password managers and showhow password managers would somehow push users to \u201ccopy\u201d theirpasswords to their clipboard: this has security implications since thedevice clipboard can be accessed by any app installed on the user\u2019sdevice. Interestingly, we note that password managers using a11yor Autofill Service are not affected by these problems: passwordsshared via these \u201cmodern\u201d features do not go through the clipboard.However, our paper, unfortunately, shows that even these modernmechanisms are affected by security problems as well."], "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/43": ["We have carried out further experiments with the aim of assessing whether current mobile password managers are vulnerable to automatically filling hidden fields.

This is similar to what previous research has attempted with web-based password managers [? ]: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that these attacks work with mobile password managers as well.

For this reason, to install apps hosted outside the Play Store, users need to manually enable a security option called side-loading (off by default). Every app needs to define some metadata, the most important being the package name, a developer-specified string that acts as the main app identifier. While it is commonly believed that package names are analogous to web domain names for mobile apps, they are actually very different for what concerns security guarantees.

This yet another \u201cfeature\u201d that opens the possibility for a stealthy and practical end-to-end phishing attack, which we describe next."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-56221905": 1, "wikipedia-54427559": 1, "wikipedia-48833157": 1, "wikipedia-2571015": 1, "wikipedia-4696394": 1, "wikipedia-22852610": 1, "wikipedia-30874632": 1, "wikipedia-59439491": 1, "wikipedia-526999": 1, "wikipedia-26097859": 1, "arxiv-2310.14137": 1, "arxiv-2501.17760": 1, "arxiv-1704.03356": 1, "arxiv-2103.03511": 1, "arxiv-1707.08015": 1, "arxiv-2110.08517": 1, "arxiv-2112.12597": 1, "arxiv-2209.01568": 1, "arxiv-1306.6729": 1, "arxiv-2110.06657": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/0": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/49": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/6": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/12": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/2": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/15": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/5": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/39": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/11": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-56221905": 1, "wikipedia-54427559": 1, "wikipedia-48833157": 1, "wikipedia-2571015": 1, "wikipedia-4696394": 1, "wikipedia-22852610": 1, "wikipedia-30874632": 1, "wikipedia-59439491": 1, "wikipedia-526999": 1, "wikipedia-26097859": 1, "arxiv-2310.14137": 1, "arxiv-2501.17760": 1, "arxiv-1704.03356": 1, "arxiv-2103.03511": 2, "arxiv-1707.08015": 1, "arxiv-2110.08517": 1, "arxiv-2112.12597": 1, "arxiv-2209.01568": 1, "arxiv-1306.6729": 1, "arxiv-2110.06657": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/0": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/9": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/49": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/6": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/12": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/2": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/15": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/5": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/39": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/11": 1}}}

Nowadays, web phishing is significantly more challenging than mobile phishing. On the web, the user can clearly see which website she is interacting with: she has the chance to check the domain name, whether the connection is done via HTTPS, and whether there is a valid SSL certificate. In the mobile world, however, there are no such indicators. In fact, as previous works have pointed out [8, 9, 36], there is currently no \u201cgreen lock\u201d or any space for any trusted indicator: these previous works have shown that a malicious app spoofing the Facebook UI can be made indistinguishable from the legitimate Facebook app\u2014even for a security-savvy user. The key requirement for these pixel-perfect attacks is the ability to control all the pixels on the screen. A website cannot achieve that, but an attacker can use Instant Apps to do just that: gain code execution on the device outside the browser\u2019s JavaScript sandbox and gain the ability to fully control the UI (without requesting any permission).\n\nOnce the attacker has gained full UI control, there are many possibilities. One first example is that the Instant App could resemble the real Facebook app, which can be made indistinguishable from the legitimate one. A second example would be to resemble the browser app itself : as the attacker controls every pixel of the screen, nothing prevents her from showing the user a browser-like view with a spoofed facebook.com domain name and a green lock. Once again, this attack can be made indistinguishable from a legitimate scenario."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-50649737": 1, "wikipedia-31648398": 1, "wikipedia-45233025": 1, "wikipedia-41981099": 1, "wikipedia-982385": 1, "wikipedia-87405": 1, "wikipedia-46949172": 1, "wikipedia-43223929": 1, "wikipedia-51090807": 1, "wikipedia-52941039": 1, "arxiv-2503.10239": 1, "arxiv-2501.07805": 1, "arxiv-2412.10922": 1, "arxiv-1603.05369": 1, "arxiv-2307.09317": 1, "arxiv-2306.07495": 1, "arxiv-1603.00059": 1, "arxiv-1706.08879": 1, "arxiv-2306.08134": 1, "arxiv-2004.07376": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/39": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/38": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/10": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/46": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/27": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/15": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/41": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/40": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-50649737": 1, "wikipedia-31648398": 1, "wikipedia-45233025": 1, "wikipedia-41981099": 1, "wikipedia-982385": 1, "wikipedia-87405": 1, "wikipedia-46949172": 1, "wikipedia-43223929": 1, "wikipedia-51090807": 1, "wikipedia-52941039": 1, "arxiv-2503.10239": 1, "arxiv-2501.07805": 1, "arxiv-2412.10922": 1, "arxiv-1603.05369": 1, "arxiv-2307.09317": 1, "arxiv-2306.07495": 1, "arxiv-1603.00059": 1, "arxiv-1706.08879": 1, "arxiv-2306.08134": 1, "arxiv-2004.07376": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/39": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/38": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/10": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/46": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/27": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/15": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/41": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/40": 1}}}

We propose a new API that implements a secure-by-design mechanism by using domain names as the only abstraction that password managers need to interact with. Since credentials are created for websites, we argue this is a better abstraction level. In stark difference concerning existing proposals, this API, called getVerifiedDomainNames(), would directly provide to password managers a list of domain names that a given app is legitimately associated to. The API internal implementation would then be responsible for performing all the needed security checks. We envision this API to be used following the paradigm of OpenYOLO (as in Figure 2). The main difference is that password managers would directly query for domain names, and not for package names. Integration and implementation. The request for auto-filling a form follows several steps. First, the client sends an Intent to the password manager to request credentials. Then, the password manager can invoke getVerifiedDomainNames(), passing the received Intent as argument. At this point, our API performs a number of steps, whose sequence diagram is depicted in Figure 4. First, it retrieves the sender\u2019s package name from the Intent. The package name is used to extract the client\u2019s app signing key. Then, getVerifiedDomainNames() extracts from the client\u2019s manifest file the list of domain names the app claims to have access to (this list should be specified according to the standard App Link Verification [27] and Digital Asset Links [17] protocols). The API internally downloads, for each of these domain names, the associated DAL file (assetlinks.json) and it verifies that the requesting app (package name + hash of the app signing key) is listed in it. The API includes in its return value to the password manager the list of all domain names that satisfy such security checks.

Since credentials are created for websites, we argue this is a better abstraction level. In stark difference concerning existing proposals, this API, called getVerifiedDomainNames(), would directly provide to password managers a list of domain names that a given app is legitimately associated to. The API internal implementation would then be responsible for performing all the needed security checks. We envision this API to be used following the paradigm of OpenYOLO (as in Figure 2). The main difference is that password managers would directly query for domain names, and not for package names. Integration and implementation. The request for auto-filling a form follows several steps. First, the client sends an Intent to the password manager to request credentials. Then, the password manager can invoke getVerifiedDomainNames(), passing the received Intent as argument. At this point, our API performs a number of steps, whose sequence diagram is depicted in Figure 4. First, it retrieves the sender\u2019s package name from the Intent. The package name is used to extract the client\u2019s app signing key. Then, getVerifiedDomainNames() extracts from the client\u2019s manifest file the list of domain names the app claims to have access to (this list should be specified according to the standard App Link Verification [27] and Digital Asset Links [17] protocols). The API internally downloads, for each of these domain names, the associated DAL file (assetlinks.json) and it verifies that the requesting app (package name + hash of the app signing key) is listed in it.

From a conceptual point of view, DAL allows for the definition of authentication domain equivalence classes, and it makes it possible to associate an app with a website and vice versa, via verifiable statements. This mechanism works by asking websites owners to publish on their website an \u201cassets\u201d file that contains a list of apps that can be legitimately associated with it. In this case, each app is identified by its package name and by the hash of its legitimate signing key.

From a conceptual point of view, DAL allows for the definition of authentication domain equivalence classes, and it makes it possible to associate an app with a website and vice versa, via verifiable statements. This mechanism works by asking websites owners to publish on their website an \u201cassets\u201d file that contains a list of apps that can be legitimately associated with it. In this case, each app is identified by its package name and by the hash of its legitimate signing key.

Network Enabled Servers (NES) implement this model, which is also called GridRPC. Clients submit computation requests to a resource broker whose goal is to find a server available on the Grid. Scheduling is frequently applied to balance the work among the servers and a list of available servers is sent back to the client; the client is then able to send the data and the request to one of the suggested servers to solve its problem. Thanks to the growth of network bandwidth and the reduction of network latency, small computation requests can now be sent to servers available on the Grid.\n\nOne simple, yet effective, mean to execute jobs on a computing grid is to use a GridRPC middleware, which relies on the GridRPC paradigm. For each request, the GridRPC middleware manages the management of the submission, of the input and output data, of the execution of the job on the remote resource, etc. To make available a service, a programmer must implement two codes: a client, where data are defined and which is run by the user when requesting the service, and a server, which contains the implementation of the service which is executed on the remote resource."], "wikipedia-2185874": ["One common nomenclature to explain an accessibility framework is a usual client-server architecture.

A server host runs one or more server programs which share their resources with clients. A client does not share any of its resources, but requests a server's content or service function. Clients therefore initiate communication sessions with servers which await incoming requests.\nExamples of computer applications that use the client\u2013server model are Email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.\nSection::::Client and server role.\nThe \"client-server\" characteristic describes the relationship of cooperating programs in an application. The server component provides a function or service to one or many clients, which initiate requests for such services.\nServers are classified by the services they provide. For example, a web server serves web pages and a file server serves computer files. A shared resource may be any of the server computer's software and electronic components, from programs and data to processors and storage devices. The sharing of resources of a server constitutes a \"service\".\nWhether a computer is a client, a server, or both, is determined by the nature of the application that requires the service functions. For example, a single computer can run web server and file server software at the same time to serve different data to clients making different kinds of requests. Client software can also communicate with server software within the same computer. Communication between servers, such as to synchronize data, is sometimes called \"inter-server\" or \"server-to-server\" communication.\nSection::::Client and server communication.\nIn general, a service is an abstraction of computer resources and a client does not have to be concerned with how the server performs while fulfilling the request and delivering the response. The client only has to understand the response based on the well-known application protocol, i.e. the content and the formatting of the data for the requested service.\nClients and servers exchange messages in a request\u2013response messaging pattern. The client sends a request, and the server returns a response. This exchange of messages is an example of inter-process communication. To communicate, the computers must have a common language, and they must follow rules so that both the client and the server know what to expect. The language and rules of communication are defined in a communications protocol. All client-server protocols operate in the application layer. The application layer protocol defines the basic patterns of the dialogue. To formalize the data exchange even further, the server may implement an application programming interface (API). The API is an abstraction layer for accessing a service. By restricting communication to a specific content format, it facilitates parsing. By abstracting access, it facilitates cross-platform data exchange.\nA server may receive requests from many distinct clients in a short period of time. A computer can only perform a limited number of tasks at any moment, and relies on a scheduling system to prioritize incoming requests from clients to accommodate them. To prevent abuse and maximize availability, server software may limit the availability to clients. Denial of service attacks are designed to exploit a server's obligation to process requests by overloading it with excessive request rates."], "wikipedia-2915176": ["A server-side web API is a programmatic interface consisting of one or more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined request\u2013response message system, typically expressed in JSON or XML, which is exposed via the web\u2014most commonly by means of an HTTP-based web server. Mashups are web applications which combine the use of multiple server-side web APIs. Webhooks are server-side web APIs that take as input a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is designed to be used like a remote named pipe or a type of callback such that the server acts as a client to dereference the provided URI and trigger an event on another server which handles this event thus providing a type of peer-to-peer IPC."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Internally, this new API relies on an existing technical solution based on Digital Asset Links [17] verification. This solution requires websites owners to publish an \u201cassets\u201d file on their website so that an app-website \u201clink\u201d can be established.

We propose a new API that implements a secure-by-design mechanism by using domain names as the only abstraction that password managers need to interact with. Since credentials are created for websites, we argue this is a better abstraction level. In stark difference concerning existing proposals, this API, called getVerifiedDomainNames(), would directly provide to password managers a list of domain names that a given app is legitimately associated to. The API internal implementation would then be responsible for performing all the needed security checks. We envision this API to be used following the paradigm of OpenYOLO (as in Figure 2). The main difference is that password managers would directly query for domain names, and not for package names. Integration and implementation. The request for auto-filling a form follows several steps. First, the client sends an Intent to the password manager to request credentials. Then, the password manager can invoke getVerifiedDomainNames(), passing the received Intent as argument. At this point, our API performs a number of steps, whose sequence diagram is depicted in Figure 4. First, it retrieves the sender\u2019s package name from the Intent. The package name is used to extract the client\u2019s app signing key. Then, getVerifiedDomainNames() extracts from the client\u2019s manifest file the list of domain names the app claims to have access to (this list should be specified according to the standard App Link Verification [27] and Digital Asset Links [17] protocols). The API internally downloads, for each of these domain names, the associated DAL file (assetlinks.json) and it verifies that the requesting app (package name + hash of the app signing key) is listed in it. The API includes in its return value to the password manager the list of all domain names that satisfy such security checks. Given these domain names, the PM can then safely query its internal database for associated credentials and send them back to the requesting client."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-56103369": 1, "wikipedia-4851413": 1, "wikipedia-8622": 1, "wikipedia-38336626": 1, "wikipedia-7552376": 1, "wikipedia-11553435": 1, "wikipedia-43740692": 1, "wikipedia-23956711": 1, "wikipedia-22763528": 1, "wikipedia-42673705": 1, "arxiv-1702.05197": 1, "arxiv-1607.00942": 1, "arxiv-1706.09606": 1, "arxiv-2011.14841": 1, "arxiv-2106.09802": 1, "arxiv-2410.15930": 1, "arxiv-2312.09870": 1, "arxiv-2402.05159": 1, "arxiv-2202.04781": 1, "arxiv-2108.06388": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/48": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/11": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/34": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/12": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/16": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/46": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/15": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-56103369": 1, "wikipedia-4851413": 1, "wikipedia-8622": 1, "wikipedia-38336626": 1, "wikipedia-7552376": 1, "wikipedia-11553435": 1, "wikipedia-43740692": 1, "wikipedia-23956711": 1, "wikipedia-22763528": 1, "wikipedia-42673705": 1, "arxiv-1702.05197": 1, "arxiv-1607.00942": 1, "arxiv-1706.09606": 1, "arxiv-2011.14841": 1, "arxiv-2106.09802": 1, "arxiv-2410.15930": 1, "arxiv-2312.09870": 1, "arxiv-2402.05159": 1, "arxiv-2202.04781": 1, "arxiv-2108.06388": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/48": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/11": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/34": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/12": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/16": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/46": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/15": 1}}}

This means that, to date, password managers developers do not have the necessary information to securely implement their functionality, even if they wanted to. One may then wonder how Google Smart Lock, which we found to be secure, implements such mapping. We found that, although a technical solution exists, this process is not automatic: according to the official documentation [23], the last step of the process requires developers to manually fill a Google Form [26] to provide the needed information. We conclude that the adoption of a secure mapping cannot be easily addressed by the single actors alone, but it requires a community-wide effort, which this work hopes to inspire."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-26880039": 1, "wikipedia-13416135": 1, "wikipedia-52291438": 1, "wikipedia-393671": 1, "wikipedia-49263763": 1, "wikipedia-23121551": 1, "wikipedia-2847218": 1, "wikipedia-608461": 1, "wikipedia-50299750": 1, "wikipedia-327573": 1, "arxiv-2010.11668": 1, "arxiv-2405.00334": 1, "arxiv-2208.03302": 1, "arxiv-2407.02706": 1, "arxiv-2409.03989": 1, "arxiv-2407.03650": 1, "arxiv-2205.10357": 1, "arxiv-2203.13450": 1, "arxiv-2502.01822": 1, "arxiv-2312.17529": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/11": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/15": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/27": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/49": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/46": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/31": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/50": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/13": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-26880039": 1, "wikipedia-13416135": 1, "wikipedia-52291438": 1, "wikipedia-393671": 1, "wikipedia-49263763": 1, "wikipedia-23121551": 1, "wikipedia-2847218": 1, "wikipedia-608461": 1, "wikipedia-50299750": 1, "wikipedia-327573": 1, "arxiv-2010.11668": 1, "arxiv-2405.00334": 1, "arxiv-2208.03302": 1, "arxiv-2407.02706": 1, "arxiv-2409.03989": 1, "arxiv-2407.03650": 1, "arxiv-2205.10357": 1, "arxiv-2203.13450": 1, "arxiv-2502.01822": 1, "arxiv-2312.17529": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/11": 3, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/15": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/27": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/49": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/46": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/31": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/50": 2, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/42/3243734.3243778.jsonl/13": 1}}}

The key observation is that Instant Apps provide an attacker the ability to gain full control over the device UI, without the need of installing an app. In a browser-only phishing scenario, the user would have a chance to notice the green lock and inspect the domain name. However, in an Instant Apps-based attack, the attacker has full capabilities to deceive the user. For example, an attacker could create a full-screen Facebook login view (as the real Facebook app would do). As reported in existing works [4, 8, 9, 36], users cannot distinguish between these. As another example, an attacker could simulate the view of a full browser; as the attacker controls every pixel of the screen, nothing prevents her to show the user a browser-like view with a spoofed facebook.com domain name and a green lock: once again, this attack is indistinguishable from a legitimate scenario. As highlighted by several recent works, the key insight is that the UI on mobile devices cannot be trusted, and Instant Apps provide a technical way for an attacker to move from a scenario where she does not fully control it (like a web page somehow constrained by the web browser security mechanisms) to a scenario where she fully does.
