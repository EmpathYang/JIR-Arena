The study of these differences, especially within rural areas, is relatively new and distinct from the study of educational inequality which focuses on individuals within an educational system.\n\nRural and inner-city students in the United States are under-performing academically compared to their suburban peers. Factors that influence this under-performance include funding, classroom environment, and the lessons taught. Low achievement rates can also be attributed, in part, to the schools themselves. Inner-city and rural students are more likely to live in low-income households and attend schools with fewer resources compared to suburban students. They have also shown to have a less favorable view of education which stems from the values held in their communities and families regarding school, work, and success.\n\nWhen compared to suburban students, rural and inner-city students face similar achievement issues. Teacher-student interactions, the lessons taught, and knowledge about the surrounding community have shown to be important factors in helping offset the deficits faced in inner-city and urban schools. But drop-out rates are still high within both communities, as a more substantial number of minority students, who often live in these areas, drop-out of high school.\n\nThe American public school system is one in which the amount of wealth in a school district shapes the quality of the school because schools are primarily funded by local property taxes. As the school system's funding decreases, they are forced to do more with less. This frequently results in decreased student faculty ratios and increased class sizes. Many schools are also forced to cut funding for the arts and enrichment programs which may be vital to academic success. Additionally, with decreased budgets, access to specialty and advanced classes for students who show high potential frequently decreases. A less obvious consequence of financial difficulty is difficulty in attracting new teachers and staff, especially those who are experienced.\n\nIt has been shown that the socioeconomic status of the family has a large correlation with both the academic achievement and attainment of the student. \"The income defecate for inner city students is approximately $14,000 per year and $10,000 per year for the families of those living in the respective areas compared to the average income of families in sub-urban areas.\" Though, even within rural areas, there are differences in education and job choisis respective to demographics.\n\nMore well off sub-urban families can afford to spend money on their children's education in forms such as: private school, private tutoring, home lessons, and increased access to educational materials such as computers, books, educational toys, shows, and literature.\n\nSub-urban families are also frequently able to provide larger amounts of social capital to their kids, such as increased use of \"proper English\", exposure to plays and museums, and familiarity with music, dance, and other such programs. Even more, inner city students are more likely to come from single parent homes and rural students are more likely to have siblings than their sub-urban peers decreasing the amount of investment per child their families are able to afford. This notion is called \"resource dilution\" which posits that families have finite levels of resources, such as time, energy and money. When sibship (amount of siblings) increases, resources for each child becomes diluted."], "wikipedia-53734674": ["Educational inequality is the unequal access to education. During the 19th century the individuals who were more likely to have access to knowledge and learn how to read, write, and do arithmetic lived in the Northeastern (New England) region of the United States during the 17th century. During the Reconstruction Era the enrollment of black students began to evolve because of the increased population of freed blacks. Although, the enrollment rate of black students would increase from that point in time onward there is still evidence of unequal achievement between white students and students from non-white racial identities as well as between students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds \nDue to poverty being a significant factor in determining academic achievement, students who reside in impoverished communities historically perform lower than students from affluent communities as a result of lack of parental and school resources, quality teachers, and updated teaching materials. Moreover, students who reside in communities with a low socioeconomic status are often students of color. In more recent research within the 21st century regarding education inequality there is evidence that students who come from low socioeconomic backgrounds and communities of color are more likely to experience the juvenile justice system or incarceration at some point in their life; this is referred to as the school-to-prison pipeline.", "They lack the appropriate funding for quality teachers, technology, and books. These provide the fundamentals of gaining a good education. When a student does not have access to these they fall behind those who do.\nMuch research dispels the notion that school funding determines the educational achievement of students, however, funding and or quality has been shown to account for as much of a 40% variance in student achievement. Thus, school funding can be seen as a factor that can not only reproduce educational inequality, but assist in mitigating it as well.\nThe funding gap is a term often used to explain the differences in resource allocation between high income and low income schools. Many studies have found that states are spending less money on students from low income communities than they are on students from high income communities (Growing Gaps figure), a recent 2015 study found that across the United States school districts with high levels of poverty are likely to receive 10 percent less per student (in resources provided from the state and local government) compared to more affluent school districts. For students of color this funding gap is more pervasive, school districts where students of color are the majority have been shown to receive 15 percent less per student compared to school districts that are mostly white.\nThe achievement gap describes the inconsistencies in standardized test scores, rates of high school and college completion, grade point average between students of color (Black and Latino) and White students. It is significant because White students tend to achieve far more academically compared to Black and Latino students.

This was due to the post effects of the court case \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" (1896) where it was decided that educational facilities were allowed to segregate white students from students of color as long as the educational facilities were considered equal. Educational facilities did not follow the federal mandate, in a studies through taken from 1890 to 1950 of Southern States per pupil expenditures (1950s dollars) on instruction varied from Whites to Blacks. On average White students received 17\u201370 percent more educational expenditures than their Black counterparts. The first Federal legal challenge of these unequal segregated educational systems would occur in California \"Mendez v. Westminster\" in 1947 followed by \"Brown v. Board of Education\" in 1954. The decision of \"Brown v. Board of Education\" would lead to the desegregation of schools by federal law, but the years of lower education, segregation of household salaries between whites and people of color, and racial wealth gaps would leave people of color at a disadvantage to seek proper equal education for generations to come.\nDifferences of academic skills in children of different race starts at an early age, according to National Assessment of Educational Progress there is a remaining gap showing Black and Latino children being able to demonstrate cognitive proficiency compared to their White counterparts. In the data 89 percent of White children presented the ability to understand written and spoken words while only 79 and 78 percent of Black and Latino children were able to comprehend written and spoken words the trend would continue into ages 4\u20136. Experts believe that the racial differences in academic achievement fall under three major categories: genetic, cultural, and structural.", "There is a disproportionate percentage of middle and upper-class White students labeled as gifted and talented compared to lower-class, minority students. Similarly, Asian American students have been over-represented in gifted education programs. In 1992, African Americans were underrepresented in gifted education by 41%, Hispanic American students by 42%, and American Indians by 50%. Conversely, White students were over-represented in gifted education programs by 17% and Asian American minority students being labeled as gifted and talented, but research shows that there is a growing achievement gap between white students and students of color. There is also a growing gap between gifted students from low-income background and higher-income background. The reasons for the under-representation of African American, Hispanic American, and American Indian students in gifted and talented programs can be explained by (a) recruitment issues/screening and identifying; and (b) personnel issues. In addition to the unbalanced scale of gender disproportionality in formal education, students with 'special needs' comprise yet another facet of educational inequality. Prior to the 1975 passing of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (currently known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)) approximately 2 million children with special needs were not receiving sufficient public education. Of those that were within the academic system, many were reduced to lower standards of teaching, isolated conditions, or even removal from school buildings altogether and relocated out of peer circulation. Students who both are special education students and of a minority face unequal chances for a quality education to meet their personal needs. Poorly trained teachers at minority schools, poor school relationships, and poor parent-to-teacher relationships play a role in this inequality. Researchers Edward Fierros and James Conroy, in their study of district level data regarding the issue of minority over-representation, have suggested that many states may be mistaken with their current projections and that disturbing minority based trends may be hidden within the numbers. According to Fierros and Conroy, once minority children such as African Americans and Latinos are labeled as students with special needs they are far less likely than caucasians to be placed in settings of inclusive learning and often receive less desirable treatment overall.", "The enslavement of African Americans removed the access to education for generations. Once the legal abolishment of slavery was enacted, racial stigma remained. Social, economic, and political barriers held blacks in a position of subordination. Although legally African Americans had the ability to be learning how to read and write, they were often prohibited from attending schools with White students. This form of segregation is often referred to as \"de jure\" segregation. The schools that allowed African American students to attend often lacked financial support, thus providing inadequate educational skills for their students. Freedmen's schools existed but they focused on maintaining African Americans in servitude, not enriching academic prosperity. The United States then experienced legal separation in schools between whites and blacks. Schools were supposed to receive equal resources but there was an undoubted inequality. It was not until 1968 that Black students in the South had universal secondary education. Research reveals that there was a shrinking of inequality between racial groups from 1970\u20131988, but since then the gap has grown again.

Despite the fact that it is illegal to not accept students based on their race, religion, or ethnicity, in the Southwest of the United States Latinos were often segregated through the deliberate practice of school and public officials. This form of segregation is referred to as de facto segregation. American Indians experienced the enforcement of missionary schools that emphasized the assimilation into white culture and society. Even after \"successful\" assimilation, those American Indians experienced discrimination in white society and often rejection by their tribe. It created a group that could not truly benefit even if they gained an equal education. American universities are separated into various classes, with a few institutions, such as the Ivy League schools, much more exclusive than the others. Among these exclusive institutions, educational inequality is extreme, with only 6% and 3% of their students coming from the bottom two income quintiles.", "Educational inequalities continue despite the increased spending. They do not have consistent learning outcomes across the upazilas. In almost 2/3 of upazilas, the dropout rate is over 30 percent. They have difficulty acquiring quality teachers and 97 percent of preprimary and primary students are in overcrowded classrooms.\n\nWithin South Africa, there are numerous factors that effect the quality of tertiary education. The country inherited class, race and gender inequality in the social, political, and economic spheres during the Apartheid. The 1994 constitution emphasizes higher education as useful for human resource development and of great importance to any economic and social transitions. However, they are still fighting to overcome the colonialism and racism in intellectual spaces. Funding from the government has a major stake in the educational quality received. As a result of declining government support, the average class size in South Africa is growing. The increased class size limits student-teacher interactions, therefore further hindering students with low problem solving and critical thinking skills.\n\nEvidence from the British birth cohort studies has illustrated the powerful influence of family socio-economic background on children's educational attainment. These differences emerge early in childhood, and continue to grow throughout the school years.\n\nIn the United States, schools are funded by local property taxes. Because of this, the more affluent a neighborhood, the higher the funding for that school district. Although this situation seems favorable, the problem emerges when the equation is reversed. In neighborhoods inhabited by predominantly working and lower-class families, properties are less expensive, and so property taxes are much lower than those in affluent neighborhoods. Consequently, funding for the school districts to which working and lower class children are assigned is also significantly lower than the funding for the school districts to which children of affluent families are assigned. Thus, students in working and lower class schools do not receive the same quality of education and access to resources as do students from affluent families."], "wikipedia-30631120": ["Educational equity depends on two main factors. The first is fairness, which implies that factors specific to one's personal conditions should not interfere with the potential of academic success. The second important factor is inclusion, which refers to a comprehensive standard that applies to everyone in a certain education system. These two factors are closely related and depend on each other for an educational system's success.\nHowever, inequity in education is challenging to avoid, and can be broken down into inequity due to socioeconomic standing, race, gender or disability. Educational equity is also based in the historical context of the location, people and structure. History shapes the outcome of individuals within the education system.\nIncome has always played an important role in shaping academic success. Those who come from a family of a higher socioeconomic status (SES) are privileged with more opportunities than those of lower SES. Those who come from a higher SES can afford things like better tutors, rigorous SAT/ACT prep classes, impressive summer programs, and so on. Parents generally feel more comfortable intervening on behalf of their children to acquire better grades or more qualified teachers (Levitsky). Parents of a higher SES are more willing to donate large sums of money to a certain institution to better improve their child's chances of acceptance, along with other extravagant measures. This creates an unfair advantage and distinct class barrier.\nThe extraordinarily high cost of the many prestigious high schools and universities in the United States makes an attempt at a \"level playing field\" for all students not so level. High-achieving low-income students do not have the means to attend selective schools that better prepare a student for later success. Because of this, low-income students do not even attempt to apply to the top-tier schools for which they are more than qualified. In addition, neighborhoods generally segregated by class leave lower-income students in lower-quality schools. For higher-quality schooling, students in low-income areas would have to take public transport which they can't pay for. Fewer than 30 percent of students in the bottom quarter of incomes even enroll in a four-year school and among that group, fewer than half graduate.\nAnother contributor to the inequality in the education system is tracking. Tracking sorts students into different classes or groups based on ability or future plans. The point of tracking is to create an environment in which the student's abilities match both the curriculum as well as the other student's in the class. This separation, however, creates an inequality within itself. Starting at an extremely young age, the sorting of students mimics a hierarchy similar to what may form later in life. Students are both viewed and treated differently depending on which track they take. The quality of teaching and curricula vary between tracks and as a result, those of the lower track are disadvantaged with inferior resources, teachers, etc. In many cases, tracking stunts students who may develop the ability to excel past their original placement."], "wikipedia-16973246": ["China used to have big gender inequality issues in education, but the huge economic and societal development since the 1980s actually became a major factor in improving gender equality. The Government has more money to invest into the education system, and more schools were built during these years. People including girls have more opportunities to go to school. However, there is still a notable difference in gender equality in education between urban and rural areas.\n\nIn the last century, the passing of the Title IX made a significant progress in gender equality in education. The law intervenes not only decrease the sex discrimination on campus but also make female have equal opportunity as male to go to school. Before 1970s, the discrimination in admission blocked many females from school.

The study of these differences, especially within rural areas, is relatively new and distinct from the study of educational inequality which focuses on individuals within an educational system.\n\nRural and inner-city students in the United States are under-performing academically compared to their suburban peers. Factors that influence this under-performance include funding, classroom environment, and the lessons taught. Low achievement rates can also be attributed, in part, to the schools themselves. Inner-city and rural students are more likely to live in low-income households and attend schools with fewer resources compared to suburban students.

These provide the fundamentals of gaining a good education. When a student does not have access to these they fall behind those who do.\nSection::::Summer learning gap.\nAn imbalance in resources at home creates a phenomenon called the summer learning gap. This exhibits the impact of resources outside of school that influence a child\u2019s education progression. It uncovers a troubling contrast between the growth in math skills over the summer between children of high SES and children of low SES.\nThe graph displaying the summer learning gap shows the higher SES children starting above the lower SES children at year one. The higher SES children are already ahead of the lower SES children before grade school even starts because of the amount of resources available to them at home. This may be due to their early introduction into literacy and higher vocabulary due to the higher amount of words they are exposed to as mention in a previous paragraph. Also, the lower SES children\u2019s access to books is solely through school and their reading skills are not developed at all at year one because they have not had the exposure yet.\nAs the graph goes on, it is evident that the two groups of children learn at the same rate only when they are in school. The higher SES students are still above the lower SES students because the rate of learning of the children changes radically during the summer. In the summer the higher SES children show a very slight increase in learning. This is due to their access to various resources during the summer months. Their families are able to enroll them in summer enrichment activities such as summer camp. These activities ensures that they are still being educationally stimulated even when not in school. While at the same time, lower SES students show evidence of a slight decrease in learning during the summer months. Lower SES students do not have the same opportunities as the higher SES students. During the summer, these students are not focused on learning during the summer. Their parents do not enroll them in as many summer activities because they cannot afford them and so the children are able to have more autonomy and freedom in those three months. They are concerned with having fun and thus forget some of what they gained during the school year. This continuing disparity from year to year results in an approximately 100 point difference in their math scores at year six.\nSection::::School funding.\nMuch research dispels the notion that school funding determines the educational achievement of students, however, funding and or quality has been shown to account for as much of a 40% variance in student achievement. Thus, school funding can be seen as a factor that can not only reproduce educational inequality, but assist in mitigating it as well.\nThe funding gap is a term often used to explain the differences in resource allocation between high income and low income schools. Many studies have found that states are spending less money on students from low income communities than they are on students from high income communities (Growing Gaps figure), a recent 2015 study found that across the United States school districts with high levels of poverty are likely to receive 10 percent less per student (in resources provided from the state and local government) compared to more affluent school districts. For students of color this funding gap is more pervasive, school districts where students of color are the majority have been shown to receive 15 percent less per student compared to school districts that are mostly white.\nThe funding gap has many implications for those students whose school districts are receiving less aid from the state and local government (in comparison to less impoverished districts). For students in the former districts this funding gap has led to poorer teacher quality which has been shown to lead to low levels of educational attainment. In summary, recent research has pointed to school funding as an explanation for the higher levels of low educational attainment among poor and minority students.\nSection::::Neighborhood effects.\nNeighborhoods play a significant effect on the development in adolescents and young adults. As a result, much research has studied how neighborhood\u2019s can explain a person\u2019s level of educational attainment. These findings are highlighted below.\nResearch has shown that an adolescent\u2019s neighborhood can significantly affect his or her life chances. Children from poorer neighborhoods are less likely to climb out of poverty compared to children who grow up in more affluent neighborhoods. In terms of education, students from neighborhoods with a high SES have higher levels of school readiness and higher IQ levels. Studies have also shown that there are \u201clinks between neighborhood high SES and educational attainment\u201d in regards to older adolescents. Children growing up in neighborhoods with a high SES are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college compared to students growing up in low SES neighborhoods. Living in a low SES neighborhood has many implications in terms of education. Among them are \u201cgreater chances of having a child before age 18; lesser chances of graduating from high school; and earning lower wages as a young adult. Experiencing more neighborhood poverty as a child is also associated with a lower rate of college graduation.\u201d \nThe neighborhood effect is mitigated when students who grow up in low SES neighborhoods move to high SES neighborhoods. These students are more likely to reap the same benefits of the students in high SES neighborhoods and school systems; their chances of attending college are much higher than the student\u2019s who stayed in low SES neighborhoods. Such policies that could give way to this are compulsory integration and busing, however, they have found themselves to be the source of great controversy historically.\nSection::::Achievement gap.\nThe achievement gap describes the inconsistencies in standardized test scores, rates of high school and college completion, grade point average between students of color (Black and Latino) and White students. It is significant because White students tend to achieve far more academically compared to Black and Latino students. Latino and Black students have some of the lowest college school completion rates in the United States, on average, they also have lower literacy rates in school, and lag behind White students in terms of math and science proficiency. It is important to understand that these discrepancies have long-term achievement effects on Latino and Black students.\nThere are several factors that can explain the achievement gap. Among some of the most studied and popular theories are that predominantly Black/Latino schools are concentrated in low SES neighborhoods that do not receive adequate resources to invest in their student\u2019s education (such as the ability to pay for qualified teachers) and that parental influence in Black and Latino families lags behind White families in terms of involvement in school. Family influence is significant as is seen by a study that demonstrated how high levels of parental involvement in low income communities can actually assist in mitigating the achievement gap.\nSection::::Prison pipeline.\nThe school-to-prison pipeline is a national trend in the United States of children who are transitioning out of their public schools and into the juvenile criminal justice system through their school districts policies, such as zero tolerance, which use law enforcement to address behavioral issues. In the face of increasing awareness of bullying in schools a response growing in popularity has been the implementation of policies such as zero tolerance, where school officials are required to enforce the strictest punishments for set infractions regardless of the circumstances in which they occurred. Rather than the reduction of bullying and school violence that was intended, zero tolerance instead functions as a mechanism of expulsion. These policies disproportionately target students of color, evidence reveals a rise among African American males in the prison system who were expelled from schools with more recently implemented zero tolerance policies. This trend, as a result of institutional racism, ends in students being moved into the criminal justice system.\nIn the event that students do not directly enter the juvenile system through these policies there are several manners in which they do indirectly. One of these has been recognized as the push-out phenomenon where the punitive measures such as suspension and expulsion combine to push students to dropping out of school, a major predictors for incarceration. Students of color are being pushed out of learning spaces where they should be welcomed and given the opportunity to learn and grow, in the direction of the prison system. There are only so many absences and transfers a child could endure before the only reasonable solution to end what must feel like a never ending cycle. Zero Tolerance and policies similar in nature lead to the criminalization of acts have no such nature. In 2012 in Texas an honors student named Diane Tran was fined and sentenced to adult prison with people who have committed serious crimes for the offense of truancy. She missed her class due to having to work two jobs in order to support her family. Tran is one example of many students who have been persecuted and punished far too harshly for minor infractions. These disparities in punishment between race and ability manifest themselves in what is known as the Discipline Gap.\nSection::::Discipline gap.\nThis discipline gap is the disproportionate representation of minority students rates of expulsion and suspension as opposed to their privileged peers. At the primary and secondary education level the trend of African American students being the worst punished in schools holds even when students are engaging in the same infraction.\nThe loss of instruction time in the classroom can hugely impact student performance. They academically suffer and gain an increased chance in grade retention after one is suspended once they are more likely to be again. The increasingly severe consequences of their actions have students become prey to the push-out mechanism and drop out of school altogether.\nThe cultural barrier in education between teachers, students, and parents can manifest itself in ways that disadvantage students. In parenting, styles could make itself apparent in the children's response to authority. The concerted cultivation approach of parent is when students who are taught from a young age how to engage with authority and are given the opportunity to practice this in after school activities. These are opportunities that are less often afforded to students of color as opposed to their white counterparts. The alternate approach of natural growth is one that encourages obedience rather than communication with authority figures as a child but this tends to become less effective as one becomes an adult. Minority students are more commonly"], "wikipedia-20381835": ["Educational inequality is the unequal distribution of academic resources, including but not limited to; school funding, qualified and experienced teachers, books, and technologies to socially excluded communities.

In regards to screening and identifying gifted and talented students, most states use a standardized achievement and aptitude test, which minority students have a history of performing poorly on. Arguments against standardized tests claim that they are culturally biased, favoring White students, require a certain mastery of the English language, and can lack cultural sensitivity in terms of format and presentation. In regards to personnel issues, forty-six states use teacher nominations, but many teachers are not trained in identifying or teaching gifted students. Teachers also tend to have lower expectations of minority students, even if they are identified as gifted. Forty-five states allow for parental nominations, but the nomination form is not sensitive to cultural differences and minority parents can have difficulty understanding the form. Forty-two states allow self nomination, but minority students tend not to self nominate because of social-emotional variables like peer pressure or feeling isolated or rejected by peers. Additionally, some students are identified as gifted and talented simply because they have parents with the knowledge, political skills, and power to require schools to classify their child as gifted and talented. Therefore, providing their child with special instruction and enrichment.

Even after \"successful\" assimilation, those American Indians experienced discrimination in white society and often rejection by their tribe. It created a group that could not truly benefit even if they gained an equal education.\nAmerican universities are separated into various classes, with a few institutions, such as the Ivy League schools, much more exclusive than the others. Among these exclusive institutions, educational inequality is extreme, with only 6% and 3% of their students coming from the bottom two income quintiles.", "Educational inequalities continue despite the increased spending. They do not have consistent learning outcomes across the upazilas. In almost 2/3 of upazilas, the dropout rate is over 30 percent. They have difficulty acquiring quality teachers and 97 percent of preprimary and primary students are in overcrowded classrooms.\n\nIn the United States, schools are funded by local property taxes. Because of this, the more affluent a neighborhood, the higher the funding for that school district. Although this situation seems favorable, the problem emerges when the equation is reversed. In neighborhoods inhabited by predominantly working and lower-class families, properties are less expensive, and so property taxes are much lower than those in affluent neighborhoods. Consequently, funding for the school districts to which working and lower class children are assigned is also significantly lower than the funding for the school districts to which children of affluent families are assigned. Thus, students in working and lower class schools do not receive the same quality of education and access to resources as do students from affluent families. The reality of the situation is that distribution of resources for schools is based on the socioeconomic status of the parents of the students. As a result, the U.S. educational system significantly aids in widening the gap between the rich and the poor. This gap has increased, rather than decreased, over the past few decades due in part to a lack of social mobility."], "wikipedia-30631120": ["Educational equity, also referred to as \"Equity in education\", is a measure of achievement, fairness, and opportunity in education. The study of education equity is often linked with the study of excellence and equity.\nEducational equity depends on two main factors. The first is fairness, which implies that factors specific to one's personal conditions should not interfere with the potential of academic success. The second important factor is inclusion, which refers to a comprehensive standard that applies to everyone in a certain education system. These two factors are closely related and depend on each other for an educational system's success.\nThe growing importance of education equity is based on the premise that an individual\u2019s level of education directly correlates to future quality of life. Therefore, an academic system that practices educational equity is a strong foundation of a society that is fair and thriving. However, inequity in education is challenging to avoid, and can be broken down into inequity due to socioeconomic standing, race, gender or disability. Educational equity is also based in the historical context of the location, people and structure. History shapes the outcome of individuals within the education system.\nSection::::Equity vs. equality.\nOften, the terms \"equity\" and \"equality\" are interchanged when referring to educational equity. Although similar, there can be important distinctions between the two.\nSection::::Equity vs. equality.:Equity.\nEquity recognizes that some are at a larger disadvantage than others and aims at compensating for these peoples misfortunes and disabilities to ensure that everyone can attain the same type of healthy lifestyle. Examples of this are: \u201cWhen libraries offer literacy programs, when schools offer courses in English as a second language, and when foundations target scholarships to students from poor families, they operationalize a belief in equity of access as fairness and as justice\u201d. Equity recognizes this uneven playing field and aims to take extra measures by giving those who are in need more than others who are not. Equity aims at making sure that everyone's lifestyle is equal even if it may come at the cost of unequal distribution of access and goods. Social justice leaders in education strive to ensure equitable outcomes for their students.\nSection::::Equity vs. equality.:Equality.\nThe American Library Association defines equality as: \u201caccess to channels of communication and sources of information that is made available on even terms to all--a level playing field--is derived from the concept of fairness as uniform distribution, where everyone is entitled to the same level of access and can avail themselves if they so choose.\u201d In this definition of equality no one person has an unfair advantage. Everyone is given equal opportunities and accessibility and are then free to do what they please with it. However, this is not to say that everyone is then inherently equal. Some people may choose to seize these open and equal opportunities while others let them pass by.\nSection::::Socio-economic equity in education.\nSection::::Socio-economic equity in education.:Income and class.\nIncome has always played an important role in shaping academic success. Those who come from a family of a higher socioeconomic status (SES) are privileged with more opportunities than those of lower SES. Those who come from a higher SES can afford things like better tutors, rigorous SAT/ACT prep classes, impressive summer programs, and so on. Parents generally feel more comfortable intervening on behalf of their children to acquire better grades or more qualified teachers (Levitsky). Parents of a higher SES are more willing to donate large sums of money to a certain institution to better improve their child's chances of acceptance, along with other extravagant measures. This creates an unfair advantage and distinct class barrier.\nSection::::Socio-economic equity in education.:Costs of education.\nThe extraordinarily high cost of the many prestigious high schools and universities in the United States makes an attempt at a \"level playing field\" for all students not so level. High-achieving low-income students do not have the means to attend selective schools that better prepare a student for later success. Because of this, low-income students do not even attempt to apply to the top-tier schools for which they are more than qualified. In addition, neighborhoods generally segregated by class leave lower-income students in lower-quality schools. For higher-quality schooling, students in low-income areas would have to take public transport which they can't pay for. Fewer than 30 percent of students in the bottom quarter of incomes even enroll in a four-year school and among that group, fewer than half graduate.\nSection::::Socio-economic equity in education.:Tracking.\nAnother contributor to the inequality in the education system is tracking. Tracking sorts students into different classes or groups based on ability or future plans. The point of tracking is to create an environment in which the student's abilities match both the curriculum as well as the other student's in the class. This separation, however, creates an inequality within itself. Starting at an extremely young age, the sorting of students mimics a hierarchy similar to what may form later in life. Students are both viewed and treated differently depending on which track they take. The quality of teaching and curricula vary between tracks and as a result, those of the lower track are disadvantaged with inferior resources, teachers, etc. In many cases, tracking stunts students who may develop the ability to excel past their original placement.\nSection::::Racial equity in education.\nFrom a scientific point of view, the human species is a single species. Nevertheless, the term racial group is enshrined in legislation, and phrases such as race equality and race relations are in widespread official use. Racial equity in education means the assignment of students to public schools and within schools without regard to their race. This includes providing students with a full opportunity for participation in all educational programs regardless of their race.\nThe educational system and its response to racial concerns in education vary from country to country. Below are some examples of countries that have to deal with racial discrimination in education. \nBULLET::::- US Department of Education: The Commission on Equity and Excellence in Education issues a seminal report in 2013. It is not a restatement of public education's struggles, nor is it a mere list of recommendations. Rather, this is a declaration of an urgent national mission: to provide equity and excellence in education in American public schools once and for all. This collective wisdom is a historic blueprint for making the dream of equity, and a world-class education, for each and every American child a reality.\nThe struggle for equality of access to formal education and equality of excellent educational outcomes is part of the history of education in this country and is tied up with the economic, political, social history of the peoples who are part of it. From the beginning of this nation, there were many barriers to the schooling and education of girls and racial, national origin, and language groups not from the dominant culture. Approaches and resources for achieving equality and equity in the public schooling of girls and ethnic, racial, and language minority groups are still evolving.\nBULLET::::- Asia-Pacific Region: Globalization of the economy, increasingly diverse and interconnected populations, and rapid technological change are posing new and demanding challenges to individuals and societies alike. School systems are rethinking the knowledge and skills students need for success, and the educational strategies and systems required for all children to achieve them. Within the Asia-Pacific region, for example, Korea, Shanghai-China, and Japan are examples of Asian education systems that have climbed the ladder to the top in both quality and equity indicators.\nBULLET::::- South Africa: A major task of South Africa's new government in 1994 was to promote racial equity in the state education system. During the apartheid era, which began when the National Party won control of Parliament in 1948 and ended with a negotiated settlement more than four decades later, the provision of education was racially unequal by design. Resources were lavished on schools serving white students while schools serving the black majority were systematically deprived of qualified teachers, physical resources and teaching aids such as textbook and stationery. The rationale for such inequity was a matter of public record.\nSection::::Racial equity in education.:Higher education.\nHigher education plays a vital role in preparing students for the employment market and active citizenship both nationally and internationally. By embedding race equality in teaching and learning, institutions can ensure that they acknowledge the experiences and values of all students, including minority ethnic and international students. Universities Scotland first published the Race Equality Toolkit: learning and teaching in 2006 in response to strong demand from the universities in Scotland for guidance on meeting their statutory obligations.\nSection::::Gender equity in education.\nGender equity in practicality refers to both male and female concerns, yet most of the gender bias is against women in the developing world. Gender discrimination in education has been very evident and underlying problem in many countries, especially in developing countries where cultural and societal stigma continue to hinder growth and prosperity for women. Global Campaign for Education (GCE) followed a survey called \"Gender Discrimination in Violation of Rights of Women and Girls\" states that one tenth of girls in primary school are 'unhappy' and this number increases to one fifth by the time they reach secondary schools. Some of the reasonings that girls provided include harassment, restorations to freedom, and an inherent lack of opportunities, compared to boys.\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) understands Education as a \" fundamental human right and essential for the exercise of all other human rights. It promotes individual freedom and empowerment and yields important development benefits.\"\nUN Special Rapporteur Katarina Tomasevki developed the '4A' framework on the Right to Education. The '4A' framework encompasses availability, accessibility, acceptability and adaptability as fundamental to the institution of education. And yet girls in many underdeveloped countries are denied secondary education. \nFigure on the right shows the discrepancies in secondary education in the world. Countries such as Sudan, Somalia", "Equity in education means that personal or social circumstances such as gender, ethnic origin or family background, are not obstacles to achieving educational potential (definition of fairness) and that all individuals reach at least a basic minimum level of skills (definition of inclusion). In these education systems, the vast majority of students have the opportunity to attain high-level skills, regardless of their own personal and socio-economic circumstances.", "The long-term social and economic consequences of having little education are more tangible now than ever before. Those without the skills to participate socially and economically in society generate higher costs of healthcare, income support, child welfare and social security.\nSection::::Challenges in educational equity.:Societal structure and costs.\nWhile both basic education and higher education have both been improved and expanded in the past 50 years, this has not translated to a more equal society in terms of academics. While the feminist movement has made great strides for women, other groups have not been as fortunate. Generally, social mobility has not increased, while economic inequality has. So, while more students are getting a basic education and even attending universities, a dramatic divide is present and many people are still being left behind.\nSection::::Challenges in educational equity.:Increase migration and diversity.\nAs increased immigration causes problems in educational equity for some countries, poor social cohesion in other countries is also a major issue. In countries where continued migration causes an issue, the ever-changing social structure of different races makes it difficult to propose a long-term solution to educational equity. On the other hand, many countries with consistent levels of diversity experience long-standing issues of integrating minorities. Challenges for minorities and migrants are often exacerbated as these groups statistically struggle more in terms of both lower academic performance and lower socio-economic status."], "wikipedia-16973246": ["Sex differences in education are a type of sex discrimination in the education system affecting both men and women during and after their educational experiences. Men are more likely to be literate on a global average, although women are more prevalent at reading in some countries. Men and women find themselves having gender differences when attaining their educational goals. Although men and women can have the same level of education, it is more difficult for women to have higher management jobs, and future employment and financial worries can intensify. Men tended to receive more education than women in the past, but the gender gap in education has reversed in recent decades in most Western countries and many non-Western countries.\nGender based inequalities in education around the world, according to UNESCO, are mainly determined by \"poverty, geographical isolation, minority status, disability, early marriage and pregnancy and gender-based violence\". Only in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean are girls as or more likely to attend school than boys. In the rest of the world, more girls remain out of school than boys and \"women make up two thirds of the 750 million adults without basic literacy skills\". The differences between girls' and boys' enrolment rates are largest in the Middle East and in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nDifferences in adults' educational achievement are larger than differences in children's school enrollment rates. This reflects past inequalities in access to education, particularly access to higher education. Gender differences in educational attainment are largest in South Asia, where 60.6% of men have at least some secondary education, compared to 39.8% of women.\nThe countries with the largest difference between men's and women's average years of schooling are Afghanistan and India. In Afghanistan, the average male has 6 years of schooling, compared to 1.9 years for the average female.\nIn developed countries, women are still underrepresented in science, technologies, engineering and mathematics. According to OECD 71% of men graduates with a science degree work as professionals in physics, mathematics and engineering, where as only 43% women work as professionals. \"Fewer then 1 in 3 engineering graduates, and fewer than 1 in 5 computer science graduates are female\" This gap is likely caused by stereotypes and a difference in encouragement in primary and secondary education.", "Educational inequalities refer to disparities in access to, participation in, and outcomes of education based on various factors such as gender, race, socioeconomic status, and cultural norms. Examples relevant to this study include:\n1. Gender disparities in course-taking, where females tend to take fewer advanced mathematical and scientific courses, leading to different educational and occupational paths.\n2. Cultural norms influencing educational pathways, such as societal expectations for women to be mothers, leading them to pursue occupations that allow for long leaves of absence.\n3. Hidden curriculum effects, where certain values and norms are instilled through curriculum, often emphasizing roles played by white males and downplaying contributions of women and people of color.\n4. Differential parental involvement, where parents may spend differently based on the gender of their children, such as spending 20% less on girls' education in Nepal.\n5. Classroom interactions and linguistic sexism, where teachers' differing reactions to similar behaviors in male and female pupils contribute to long-term gender disparities in behavior.", "Teachers and staff in an elementary may reinforce certain gender roles without thinking. Their communicative interactions may also single out other students. For example, a teacher may call on one or two students more than the others. This causes those who are called on less to be less confidant. A gendered example would be a teacher expecting a girl to be good at coloring or a boy to be good at building. These types of interactions restrict a student to the particular role assigned to them.\nOther consequences come in the form of what is communicated as appropriate behaviors for boys and girls in classes like physical education. While a teacher may not purposely try to communicate these differences, they may tend to make comments based on gender physical ability. For example, a male may be told that he throws like a girl which perpetuates him to become more masculine and use brute force. A female, on the other hand, might be told she is too masculine looking to where she becomes more reserved and less motivated.\nSome gender discrimination, whether intentional or not, also effects the positions students may strive for in the future. Females may not find interest in science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM), because they have not been exposed to those types of classes. This is because interactions within the school and society are pushing them towards easier, more feminine classes, such as home economics or art. They also might not see many other women going into the STEM field. This then lowers the number of women in STEM, further producing and continuing this cycle. This also has a similar effect on males. Because of interactions from teachers, such as saying boys do not usually cook, males may then be less likely to follow careers such as a chef, an artist, or a writer."], "wikipedia-14546141": ["Existing disparities between socio-economic groups continue the perpetuation of a workforce divided into unskilled and skilled workers and ensures that low SES Americans will continue to lack the human capital they need to develop employable skills. Evidence from research conducted by the OECD shows that \"the skills-education gap has widened in Africa, South America, Eastern Europe and most developed OECD countries.\" Because skills facilitate the diffusion of technical knowledge and innovation and human capital is key to the individuals' ability to assimilate new technology and to develop institutional knowledge as well as to increase access to high-quality connections low SES has been shown to contribute to inequalities in skill building and thus depresses the employability of low-income Americans."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

These explanations are also the source of much controversy, especially since efforts to \"close the gap\" have become some of the more politically prominent education reform issues.

Typically, African American and Hispanic students are enrolled in greater numbers in special education programs than their numbers would indicate in most populations, while these groups are underrepresented in gifted programs. Research shows that these disproportionate enrollment trends may be a consequence of the differences in educational achievement among groups.", "Researchers have found that the gender achievement gap has a large impact on the future career choices of high-achieving students. Part of this is a result of the college majors that men and women choose; men are more likely to major in engineering or the hard sciences, while women are more likely to receive degrees in English, psychology, or sociology. Therefore, men are statistically more likely to enter careers that have more potential for higher long-term earnings than women.\n\nThere have been several studies done of interventions aimed at reducing the gender achievement gap in science classes. Some interventions, such as instituting mentoring programs aimed at women or restructuring the course curriculum, have had limited success. The most successful interventions have been a form of psychological interventions called values affirmation. In a famous study of women's achievement in college science by Miyake et al., values affirmation was successful in reducing the differences between male and female academic achievement in college-level introductory physics classes, and it has been particularly effective at combating the psychological phenomenon known as stereotype threat.\n\nAnother explanation to address this educational gap is the lack of resources attainable by certain groups of students. A study found that there is a need for financial literacy for students enrolled in colleges and universities. Specifically, there is a need for student knowledge about loans, budgeting, and time requirements for degree completion."], "wikipedia-33541929": ["The racial achievement gap in the United States refers to the educational disparities between various ethnic groups. It manifests itself in a variety of ways: among students, blacks and Hispanics are more likely to receive lower grades, score lower on standardized tests, drop out of high school, and they are less likely to enter and complete college than whites, while whites score lower than Asian Americans.", "The study of the achievement gap can be addressed from two standpoints\u2014from a supply-side and a demand-side viewpoint of education. In Poor Economics, Banerjee and Duflo explain the two families of arguments surrounding education of underserved populations. Demand-side arguments focus on aspects of minority populations that influence education achievement. These include family background and culture, which shape perceptions and expectations surrounding education. A large body of research has been dedicated to studying these factors contributing to the achievement gap. Supply-side arguments focus on the provision of education and resources and the systemic structures in place that perpetuate the achievement gap. These include neighborhoods, funding, and policy. In 2006, Ladson-Billings called on education researchers to move the spotlight of education research from family background to take into account the rest of the factors that affect educational achievement, as explained by the Coleman Report. The concept of opportunity gaps\u2014rather than achievement gaps\u2014has changed the paradigm of education research to assess education from a top-down approach.", "Section::::Theories about the origin of the racial achievement gap.:Education Debt. Education debt is a theory developed by Gloria Ladson-Billings, a pedagogical theorist. In her theory of education debt, she likens the focus of the achievement gap to the United States current focus on the national deficit. She argues that instead the true issue is debt rather than deficit: an education debt to African Americans, Native Americans, and Latino/as. As defined by a colleague of Ladson-Billings, Professor Emeritus Robert Haveman, education debt is the \u201cforegone schooling resources that we could have (should have) been investing in (primarily) low income kids, which deficit leads to a variety of social problems (e.g. crime, low productivity, low wages, low labor force participation) that require on-going public investment\u201d. The education debt has historical, economic, sociopolitical and moral components; the structure of the education debt theory makes is a logical cause of the racial achievement gap.", "The quality of language that the student uses is affected by family's socioeconomic backgrounds, which is another factor in the academic achievement gap. Data from research shows that when the quality of the school is better and students are given more resources, it affects the racial achievement gap by reducing it. When white and black schools were given the equal amount of resources, it shows that black students started improving while white students stayed the same because they didn't need the resources. This showed that lack of resources is a factor in the racial achievement gap. The research that was conducted shows that predominantly white schools have more resources than black schools. However, lack of resources is only a small effect on academic achievement in comparison to students\u2019 family backgrounds.", "Differences in the academic performance of African-American and White students exist even in schools that are desegregated and diverse, and studies have shown that a school's racial mix does not seem to have much effect on changes in reading scores after sixth grade, or on math scores at any age. In fact, minority students in segregated-minority schools have more optimism and greater educational aspirations as well as achievements than minority students in segregated-white schools. This can be attributed to various factors, including the attitudes of faculty and staff at segregated-white schools and the effect of stereotype threat.\n\nAn argument has been put that the disparity in income that exists between African Americans and Whites directly contributes to the racial achievement gap. This school of thought argues that the origin of this \"wealth gap\" is the slavery and racism that made it extremely difficult for African-Americans to accumulate wealth for almost 100 years. A comparable history of discrimination created a similar gap between Hispanics and whites. This results in many minority children being born into low socioeconomic backgrounds, which in turn affects educational opportunities.\n\nResearch has shown time and again that the wealth and income of parents is a primary factor influencing student achievement . A low socioeconomic background can have negative effects on a child's educational achievement before even starting school; indeed, research has shown that the achievement gap is present between races before starting formal education. On average, when entering kindergarten, African-American students are one year behind White students in terms of vocabulary and basic math skills, and this gap continues to grow as a child's education continues.", "The stereotype threat both perpetuates and is caused by the achievement gap. Furthermore, students of low academic performance demonstrate low expectations for themselves and self-handicapping tendencies. Psychologists Claude Steele, Joshua Aronson, and Steven Spencer, have found that Microaggression such as passing reminders that someone belongs to one group or another (i.e.: a group stereotyped as inferior in academics) can affect test performance.\n\nAnother consequence of the racial achievement gap can be seen in the lack of representation of minority groups in public office. Studies have shown that higher socioeconomic status\u2014in terms of income, occupation, and/or educational attainment\u2014is correlated with higher participation in politics. This participation is defined as \"individual or collective action at the national or local level that supports or opposes state structures, authorities, and/or decisions regarding allocation of public goods\"; this action ranges from engaging in activities such as voting in elections to running for public office.\nSince median income per capita for minority groups(Except Asians) is lower than that of White Americans, and since minority groups(Except Asians) are more likely to occupy less gainful employment and achieve lower education levels, there is a lowered likelihood of political participation among minority groups. Education attainment is highly correlated with earnings and occupation. And there is a proven disparity between educational attainment of White Americans and minority groups, with only 30% of bachelor's degrees awarded in 2009 to minority groups. Thus socioeconomic status\u2014and therefore political participation\u2014is correlated with race. Research has shown that African Americans, Latino Americans, and Asian Americans are less politically active, by varying degrees, than White Americans.\n\nAchievement gaps among students may also manifest themselves in the racial and ethnic composition of special education and gifted education programs. Typically, African American and Hispanic students are enrolled in greater numbers in special education programs than their numbers would indicate in most populations, while these groups are underrepresented in gifted programs. Research shows that these disproportionate enrollment trends may be a consequence of the differences in educational achievement among groups."], "wikipedia-56970574": ["The authors and subsequent researchers have posited that the word gap\u2013or certainly the differing rates of vocabulary acquisition\u2013partially explains the achievement gap in the United States, the persistent disparity in educational performance among subgroups of U.S. students, especially subgroups defined by socioeconomic status and race.\n\nThe achievement gap is explained as a result of the language gap, in that because children are lacking in their vocabulary and literary skills, they will not be as successful in academics. Hart and Risley argue this is an indispensable societal concern because it sets the child at a disadvantage for not being exposed to more vocabulary skills at a young age.\n\nPrior to the 30 million word gap study, extensive research had noted strong institutional variation in student success on standardized tests. The initial attention to achievement gap started with a 1966 publication from the U.S. Department of Education titled \u201cEquality of Educational Opportunity.\u201d The publication begins the onset of achievement gap by acknowledging that there is a great disparity within educational outcomes as a result of inequitable institutions, especially those that were not seen as part of the purview of schools such as cultural, socioeconomic, and linguistic realities of students at home.", "Other critics theorize that the language and achievement gaps are not a result of the amount of words a child is exposed to, but rather alternative theories suggest it could derive from the disconnect of linguistic practices between home and school. Thus, judging academic success and linguistic capabilities from socioeconomic status may ignore bigger societal issues. The ongoing word gap discourse can be seen as a modern movement in educational discussion.\n\nThe Word Gap theory can be seen as part of a larger development in modern educational reform and movement: the Achievement Gap discourse. It is widely accepted and noted by scholars that ideas around individual outcome in schools varies based on various demographics. Explaining variations in achievement in schools across levels of demographics that may result in a gap in student achievement has become the primary problems public schools have to address. The Discourse is based on evidence and assumptions of why primarily poor students of color do not perform at the same levels as their more affluent White and certain Asian group counterparts- it creates language to how schools and communities can be organized more optimally to help students and schools produce more equitable and successful outcomes. The Achievement Gap also addresses a gender gap achievement, and standardized test score gaps broadly across countries, notably with standardized examinations on STEM subjects. The Discourse can also be seen as a turning away from traditional explanations of performance in school as individualistic, to the creation of cultural framework understanding to help explain what conventions hinder and produce successful students. \"Under performing, adequate yearly progress (AYP), highly qualified, below basic, and proficient\" are some terms used to mark good and bad aspects of schools, their teachers, and their students which in turn reifies the Achievement Gap theory.

It is likely the result of multiple variables\u2014all of which can have an effect on one another\u2014ranging from social, economic, and educational conditions to inadequate social services and families with exceptionally low human and social capital. The effects of the achievement gap in school can be seen later in life for students.

Typically, African American and Hispanic students are enrolled in greater numbers in special education programs than their numbers would indicate in most populations, while these groups are underrepresented in gifted programs. Research shows that these disproportionate enrollment trends may be a consequence of the differences in educational achievement among groups.", "Researchers have found that the gender achievement gap has a large impact on the future career choices of high-achieving students. Part of this is a result of the college majors that men and women choose; men are more likely to major in engineering or the hard sciences, while women are more likely to receive degrees in English, psychology, or sociology. Therefore, men are statistically more likely to enter careers that have more potential for higher long-term earnings than women.\n\nThe careers that are aligned with these majors have different levels of prestige and different salaries, which can lead to a gender wage gap. U.S. Census data indicates that women who work full-time earn only 77% of what their male counterparts earn. For men and women who are ten years out of college, women earn only 69% of the salaries of their male workers.\n\nAnother explanation to address this educational gap is the lack of resources attainable by certain groups of students. A study found that there is a need for financial literacy for students enrolled in colleges and universities. Specifically, there is a need for student knowledge about loans, budgeting, and time requirements for degree completion . Focus group results in the same study concluded that students in search of financial aid information believe that there will be a lack of understanding among advisors and staff regarding minority student's cultural/identity based circumstances. As a result of this belief, many students rather just not seek any services.\n\nOn the high school level, a report finds that the greater the number of people of color enrolled at any particular school, the less likely that school has any computer science courses whatsoever .

In her theory of education debt, she likens the focus of the achievement gap to the United States current focus on the national deficit. She argues that instead the true issue is debt rather than deficit: an education debt to African Americans, Native Americans, and Latino/as.  As defined by a colleague of Ladson-Billings, Professor Emeritus Robert Haveman, education debt is the \u201cforegone schooling resources that we could have (should have) been investing in (primarily) low income kids, which deficit leads to a variety of social problems (e.g. crime, low productivity, low wages, low labor force participation) that require on-going public investment\u201d.

Additionally, parents of children living in poverty are less likely to have cognitively stimulating materials in the home for their children and are less likely to be involved in their child's school. The quality of language that the student uses is affected by family's socioeconomic backgrounds, which is another factor in the academic achievement gap.", "Differences in the academic performance of African-American and White students exist even in schools that are desegregated and diverse, and studies have shown that a school's racial mix does not seem to have much effect on changes in reading scores after sixth grade, or on math scores at any age.

Furthermore, students of low academic performance demonstrate low expectations for themselves and self-handicapping tendencies. Psychologists Claude Steele, Joshua Aronson, and Steven Spencer, have found that Microaggression such as passing reminders that someone belongs to one group or another (i.e.: a group stereotyped as inferior in academics) can affect test performance.\nSteele, Aronson and Spencer, have examined and performed experiments to see how stereotypes can threaten how students evaluate themselves, which then alters academic identity and intellectual performance. Steele tested the stereotype threat theory by giving Black and White college students a half-hour test using difficult questions from the verbal Graduate Record Examination (GRE). In the stereotype-threat condition, they told students the test diagnosed intellectual ability. In saying that the test diagnoses intellectual ability it can potentially elicit the stereotype that Blacks are less intelligent than Whites. In the no-stereotype-threat condition, they told students that the test was a problem-solving lab task that said nothing about ability. This made stereotypes irrelevant. In the stereotype threat condition, Blacks who were evenly matched with Whites in their group by SAT scores, performed worse compared to their White counterparts. In the experiments with no stereotype threat, Blacks performed slightly better than in those with a stereotype threat, though still significantly worse than whites. Aronson believes the study of stereotype threat offers some \"exciting and encouraging answers to these old questions [of achievement gaps] by looking at the psychology of stigma -- the way human beings respond to negative stereotypes about their racial or gender group\". When pressed, Steele, Aronson, and Spenser, acknowledge that their experiments on stereotype threat only explain a modest portion of test-score gaps. However, their findings have consistently been erroneously attributed to explaining the entirety of the test score gap. The American Psychological Association is one such institution that misuses the study to posit that stereotype threat undercuts the tendency of evolutionary psychologists to lay the blame on genetic and cultural factors, such as whether African Americans \"value\" education. Researchers from Heterodox Academy, a think tank dedicated to pursuing intellectual diversity in academia, posit that the tendency of some social scientists to over emphasise the potency of stereotype threat, has to do with their loyalty to politically correct clean slate ideology, rather than objective reasoning. Adherence to such dogma therefore permits these individuals to dismiss the possibility of less palatable explanations for racial group disparities, such as genetics and culture.\nSection::::Implications of the achievement gap.:Political representation.\nAnother consequence of the racial achievement gap can be seen in the lack of representation of minority groups in public office. Studies have shown that higher socioeconomic status\u2014in terms of income, occupation, and/or educational attainment\u2014is correlated with higher participation in politics. This participation is defined as \"individual or collective action at the national or local level that supports or opposes state structures, authorities, and/or decisions regarding allocation of public goods\"; this action ranges from engaging in activities such as voting in elections to running for public office.\nSince median income per capita for minority groups(Except Asians) is lower than that of White Americans, and since minority groups(Except Asians) are more likely to occupy less gainful employment and achieve lower education levels, there is a lowered likelihood of political participation among minority groups. Education attainment is highly correlated with earnings and occupation. And there is a proven disparity between educational attainment of White Americans and minority groups, with only 30% of bachelor's degrees awarded in 2009 to minority groups. Thus socioeconomic status\u2014and therefore political participation\u2014is correlated with race. Research has shown that African Americans, Latino Americans, and Asian Americans are less politically active, by varying degrees, than White Americans.\nA consequence of underrepresentation of minority groups in leadership is incongruence between policy and community needs. A study conducted by Kenneth J. Meier and Robert E. England of 82 of the largest urban school districts in the United States showed that African American membership on the school board of these districts led to more policies encouraging more African American inclusion in policy considerations. It has been shown that both passive and active representation of minority groups serves to align constituent policy preference and representation of these opinions, and thereby facilitate political empowerment of these groups.\nSection::::Implications of the achievement gap.:Special programs.\nAchievement gaps among students may also manifest themselves in the racial and ethnic composition of special education and gifted education programs. Typically, African American and Hispanic students are enrolled in greater numbers in special education programs than their numbers would indicate in most populations, while these groups are underrepresented in gifted programs. Research shows that these disproportionate enrollment trends may be a consequence of the differences in educational achievement among groups.", "NCLB has shown mixed success in eliminating the racial achievement gap. Although test scores are improving, they are improving equally for all races, which means that minority students are still behind whites. There has also been some criticism as to whether an increase in test scores actually corresponds to improvements in education, since test standards vary from state to state and from year to year."], "wikipedia-20381835": ["Educational inequality is the unequal distribution of academic resources, including but not limited to; school funding, qualified and experienced teachers, books, and technologies to socially excluded communities.

Inequality leads to major differences in the educational success or efficiency of these individuals and ultimately suppresses social and economic mobility. \"See Statistic sections for more information.\" \nMeasuring educational efficacy varies by country and even provinces/states within the country. Generally, grades, GPA scores, test scores, dropout rates, college entrance statistics, and college completion rates are used to measure educational success. These are measures of an individual's academic performance ability. When determining what should be measured in terms of the educational success of an individual, many scholars and academics suggest that GPAs, test scores, and other measures of performance ability are not the only useful tools in determining efficacy. In addition to academic performance, attainment of learning objectives, acquisition of desired skills and competencies, satisfaction, persistence, and post-college performance should all be measured and accounted for when determining the educational success of individuals. Scholars argue that academic achievement is only the direct result of attaining learning objectives and acquiring desired skills and competencies. To accurately measure educational efficacy, it is imperative to separate academic achievement because it captures only a student's performance ability and not necessarily their learning or ability to effectively use what they have learned.\nMuch of educational inequality is attributed to economic disparities that often falls along racial lines and much modern conversation about educational equity conflates the two, showing how they are inseparable from residential location and, more recently, language.

With different causes that are deeply rooted in history, society, and culture, this inequality is difficult to eradicate. Although difficult, education is vital to society's movement forward. It promotes \"citizenship, identity, equality of opportunity and social inclusion, social cohesion as well as economic growth and employment\" and for these reasons, equality is widely promoted.\nUnequal educational outcomes are attributed to several variables, including family of origin, gender, and social class.

In the data 89 percent of White children presented the ability to understand written and spoken words while only 79 and 78 percent of Black and Latino children were able to comprehend written and spoken words the trend would continue into ages 4\u20136. Experts believe that the racial differences in academic achievement fall under three major categories: genetic, cultural, and structural. For example, in the 1980s minorities experienced a cultural phenomenon called \"fear of acting White\", minorities would shun and ridicule those in their social groups who had shown a higher intelligence than others.

Race and ethnics will continue to play a major role in the disbursement of education through the American public school system, through diversity placement programs such as SEO and MLT, grants and social and cultural changes the education gap has slowly been closing between Whites and minorities in more recent years.", "There is a disproportionate percentage of middle and upper-class White students labeled as gifted and talented compared to lower-class, minority students. Similarly, Asian American students have been over-represented in gifted education programs. In 1992, African Americans were underrepresented in gifted education by 41%, Hispanic American students by 42%, and American Indians by 50%. Conversely, White students were over-represented in gifted education programs by 17% and Asian American minority students being labeled as gifted and talented, but research shows that there is a growing achievement gap between white students and students of color. There is also a growing gap between gifted students from low-income background and higher-income background.", "The enslavement of African Americans removed the access to education for generations. Once the legal abolishment of slavery was enacted, racial stigma remained. Social, economic, and political barriers held blacks in a position of subordination. Although legally African Americans had the ability to be learning how to read and write, they were often prohibited from attending schools with White students. This form of segregation is often referred to as \"de jure\" segregation. The schools that allowed African American students to attend often lacked financial support, thus providing inadequate educational skills for their students. Freedmen's schools existed but they focused on maintaining African Americans in servitude, not enriching academic prosperity. The United States then experienced legal separation in schools between whites and blacks. Schools were supposed to receive equal resources but there was an undoubted inequality. It was not until 1968 that Black students in the South had universal secondary education. Research reveals that there was a shrinking of inequality between racial groups from 1970\u20131988, but since then the gap has grown again.\nLatinos and American Indians experienced similar educational repression in the past, which effects are evident now. Latinos have been systematically shut out of educational opportunities at all levels. Evidence suggests that Latinos have experienced this educational repression in the United States as far back as 1848. Despite the fact that it is illegal to not accept students based on their race, religion, or ethnicity, in the Southwest of the United States Latinos were often segregated through the deliberate practice of school and public officials. This form of segregation is referred to as de facto segregation. American Indians experienced the enforcement of missionary schools that emphasized the assimilation into white culture and society. Even after \"successful\" assimilation, those American Indians experienced discrimination in white society and often rejection by their tribe. It created a group that could not truly benefit even if they gained an equal education.\nAmerican universities are separated into various classes, with a few institutions, such as the Ivy League schools, much more exclusive than the others. Among these exclusive institutions, educational inequality is extreme, with only 6% and 3% of their students coming from the bottom two income quintiles.", "Educational inequalities continue despite the increased spending. They do not have consistent learning outcomes across the upazilas. In almost 2/3 of upazilas, the dropout rate is over 30 percent. They have difficulty acquiring quality teachers and 97 percent of preprimary and primary students are in overcrowded classrooms.\n\nIn the United States, schools are funded by local property taxes. Because of this, the more affluent a neighborhood, the higher the funding for that school district. Although this situation seems favorable, the problem emerges when the equation is reversed. In neighborhoods inhabited by predominantly working and lower-class families, properties are less expensive, and so property taxes are much lower than those in affluent neighborhoods. Consequently, funding for the school districts to which working and lower class children are assigned is also significantly lower than the funding for the school districts to which children of affluent families are assigned. Thus, students in working and lower class schools do not receive the same quality of education and access to resources as do students from affluent families. The reality of the situation is that distribution of resources for schools is based on the socioeconomic status of the parents of the students. As a result, the U.S. educational system significantly aids in widening the gap between the rich and the poor. This gap has increased, rather than decreased, over the past few decades due in part to a lack of social mobility."], "wikipedia-53734674": ["Educational inequality is the unequal access to education. During the 19th century the individuals who were more likely to have access to knowledge and learn how to read, write, and do arithmetic lived in the Northeastern (New England) region of the United States during the 17th century. During the Reconstruction Era the enrollment of black students began to evolve because of the increased population of freed blacks. Although, the enrollment rate of black students would increase from that point in time onward there is still evidence of unequal achievement between white students and students from non-white racial identities as well as between students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nDue to poverty being a significant factor in determining academic achievement, students who reside in impoverished communities historically perform lower than students from affluent communities as a result of lack of parental and school resources, quality teachers, and updated teaching materials. Moreover, students who reside in communities with a low socioeconomic status are often students of color. In more recent research within the 21st century regarding education inequality there is evidence that students who come from low socioeconomic backgrounds and communities of color are more likely to experience the juvenile justice system or incarceration at some point in their life; this is referred to as the school-to-prison pipeline.", "The achievement gap describes the inconsistencies in standardized test scores, rates of high school and college completion, grade point average between students of color (Black and Latino) and White students. It is significant because White students tend to achieve far more academically compared to Black and Latino students. Latino and Black students have some of the lowest college school completion rates in the United States, on average, they also have lower literacy rates in school, and lag behind White students in terms of math and science proficiency. It is important to understand that these discrepancies have long-term achievement effects on Latino and Black students.\n\nThere are several factors that can explain the achievement gap. Among some of the most studied and popular theories are that predominantly Black/Latino schools are concentrated in low SES neighborhoods that do not receive adequate resources to invest in their student\u2019s education (such as the ability to pay for qualified teachers) and that parental influence in Black and Latino families lags behind White families in terms of involvement in school. Family influence is significant as is seen by a study that demonstrated how high levels of parental involvement in low income communities can actually assist in mitigating the achievement gap."], "wikipedia-56563607": ["Rural and inner-city students in the United States are under-performing academically compared to their suburban peers. Factors that influence this under-performance include funding, classroom environment, and the lessons taught. Low achievement rates can also be attributed, in part, to the schools themselves. Inner-city and rural students are more likely to live in low-income households and attend schools with fewer resources compared to suburban students. They have also shown to have a less favorable view of education which stems from the values held in their communities and families regarding school, work, and success.\nWhen compared to suburban students, rural and inner-city students face similar achievement issues. Teacher-student interactions, the lessons taught, and knowledge about the surrounding community have shown to be important factors in helping offset the deficits faced in inner-city and urban schools. But drop-out rates are still high within both communities, as a more substantial number of minority students, who often live in these areas, drop-out of high school. A study on inner-city, high school students showed that academic competency during freshman year has a positive impact on graduation rates, meaning that a students' early high school performance can be an indicator of how successful they will be in high school and if they will graduate. With the correct knowledge and understanding of the issues faced by these students, the deficits they face can be overcome."], "wikipedia-16973246": ["Gender based inequalities in education around the world, according to UNESCO, are mainly determined by \"poverty, geographical isolation, minority status, disability, early marriage and pregnancy and gender-based violence\". Only in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean are girls as or more likely to attend school than boys. In the rest of the world, more girls remain out of school than boys and \"women make up two thirds of the 750 million adults without basic literacy skills\". The differences between girls' and boys' enrolment rates are largest in the Middle East and in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nDifferences in adults' educational achievement are larger than differences in children's school enrollment rates. This reflects past inequalities in access to education, particularly access to higher education.

On the other hand, the link between inequality in in-class procrastination and end-of-course performance gaps highlights procrastination as a behavioral antecedent of educational inequality. This micro-level behavioral factor, susceptible to structural external forces and grounded in research on meta-cognition [37], can add granular insights about the development of macro-level achievement gaps through the depiction of associated psychological processes. Practically, the behavioral nature also suggests that procrastination is a malleable factor on which educators can intervene to mitigate the negative consequences on student success and educational equity.

For example, a term paper could be seem as a daunting task. If the user puts it off until the night before, they can justify their poor score by telling themselves that they would have done better with more time. This kind of justification is extremely harmful and only helps to perpetuate the cycle of procrastination.\n\nOver the years, scientists have determined that not all procrastination is the same. The first type are chronic procrastinators whom exhibit a combination of qualities from the other, more specialized types of procrastinators. \"Arousal\" types are usually self-proclaimed \"pressure performers\" and relish the exhilaration of completing tasks close to the deadline. \"Avoider\" types procrastinate to avoid the outcome of whatever task they are pushing back - whether it be a potential failure or success. \"Avoider\" types are usually very self-conscious and care deeply about other people's opinions. Lastly, \"Decisional\" procrastinators avoid making decisions in order to protect themselves from the responsibility that follows the outcome of events.\n\nSocial-cognitive models of behavior change include the constructs of motivation and volition. Motivation is seen as a process that leads to the forming of behavioral intentions. Volition is seen as a process that leads from intention to actual behavior.

It is concerned with the motivation behind choices people make without external influence and interference. SDT focuses on the degree to which an individual's behavior is self-motivated and self-determined.\n\nIntrinsic motivation refers to initiating an activity for its own sake because it is interesting and satisfying in itself, as opposed to doing an activity to obtain an external goal (extrinsic motivation). Different types of motivations have been described based on the degree they have been internalized. Internalization refers to the active attempt to transform an extrinsic motive into personally endorsed values and thus assimilate behavioural regulations that were originally external.\n\nAccording to Deci and Ryan, the three psychological needs motivate the self to initiate behavior and specify nutriments that are essential for psychological health and well-being of an individual. These needs are said to be universal, innate and psychological and include the need for competence, autonomy, and relatedness.\n\nSDT identifies three innate needs that, if satisfied, allow optimal function and growth:\nBULLET::::1. Competence\nBULLET::::2. Relatedness\nBULLET::::3. Autonomy\nThese needs are seen as universal necessities that are innate, not learned (instinctive), and seen in humanity across time, gender and culture.\n\nSDT supports three basic psychological needs that must be satisfied to foster well-being and health. These needs can be universally applied. However, some may be more salient than others at certain times and are expressed differently based on time, culture, or experience.\nBULLET::::- Competence :Seek to control the outcome and experience mastery\nBULLET::::- Relatedness : Will to interact, be connected to, and experience caring for others\nBULLET::::- Autonomy: Desire to be causal agents of one's own life and act in harmony with one's integrated self; however, Deci and Vansteenkiste note this does not mean to be independent of others\n\nIntrinsic motivation is the natural, inherent drive to seek out challenges and new possibilities that SDT associates with cognitive and social development.\n\nExtrinsic motivation comes from external sources. Deci and Ryan developed organismic integration theory (OIT), as a sub-theory of SDT, to explain the different ways extrinsically motivated behaviour is regulated.", "Section::::New developments.:Vitality and self-regulation.\nAnother area of interest for SDT researchers is the relationship between subjective vitality and self-regulation. Ryan and Deci define vitality as energy available to the self, either directly or indirectly, from basic psychological needs. This energy allows individuals to act autonomously.\nMany theorists have posited that self-regulation depletes energy but SDT researchers have proposed and demonstrated that only controlled regulation depletes energy, autonomous regulation can actually be vitalizing.\nRyan, Bernstein, and Brown used SDT to explain the effect of weekends on the well-being of adult working population. The study determined that people felt higher well-being on weekends due to greater feelings of autonomy, and feeling closer to others (relatedness), in weekend activities."], "wikipedia-1875075": ["Self-control, an aspect of inhibitory control, is the ability to regulate one's emotions, thoughts, and behavior in the face of temptations and impulses. As an executive function, self-control is a cognitive process that is necessary for regulating one's behavior in order to achieve specific goals.\nA related concept in psychology is emotional self-regulation. Self-control is like a muscle. According to studies, self-regulation, whether emotional or behavioral, was proven to be a limited resource which functions like energy. In the short term, overuse of self-control will lead to depletion. However, in the long term, the use of self-control can strengthen and improve over time.\nDesire is an affectively charged motivation toward a certain object, person, or activity, but not limited to, that associated with pleasure or relief from displeasure. Desires vary in strength and duration. A desire becomes a temptation when it impacts or enters the individual's area of self-control, if the behavior resulting from the desire conflicts with an individual\u2019s values or other self-regulatory goals."], "wikipedia-232495": ["Motivation is the reason for people's actions, willingness and goals. Motivation is derived from the word \"motive\" which is defined as a need that requires satisfaction. These needs could be wants or desires that are acquired through influence of culture, society, lifestyle, etc. or generally innate. Motivation is one's direction to behaviour, or what causes a person to want to repeat a behaviour, a set of force that acts behind the motives. An individual's motivation may be inspired by others or events (extrinsic motivation) or it may come from within the individual (intrinsic motivation). Motivation has been considered as one of the most important reasons that inspires a person to move forward in life. Motivation results from the interaction of both conscious and unconscious factors. Mastering motivation to allow sustained and deliberate practice is central to high levels of achievement e.g. in the worlds of elite sport, medicine or music.", "In relation to motivation, classical conditioning might be seen as one explanation as to why an individual performs certain responses and behaviors in certain situations. For instance, a dentist might wonder why a patient does not seem motivated to show up for an appointment, with the explanation being that the patient has associated the dentist (conditioned stimulus) with the pain (unconditioned stimulus) that elicits a fear response (conditioned response), leading to the patient being reluctant to visit the dentist.\n\nIn operant conditioning, the type and frequency of behaviour is determined mainly by its consequences. If a certain behaviour, in the presence of a certain stimulus, is followed by a desirable consequence (a reinforcer), the emitted behaviour will increase in frequency in the future, in the presence of the stimulus that preceded the behaviour (or a similar one). Conversely, if the behaviour is followed by something undesirable (a punisher), the behaviour is less likely to occur in the presence of the stimulus. In a similar manner, removal of a stimulus directly following the behaviour might either increase or decrease the frequency of that behaviour in the future (negative reinforcement or punishment). For instance, a student that gained praise and a good grade after turning in a paper, might seem more motivated in writing papers in the future (positive reinforcement); if the same student put in a lot of work on a task without getting any praise for it, he or she might seem less motivated to do school work in the future (negative punishment). If a student starts to cause trouble in class gets punished with something he or she dislikes, such as detention (positive punishment), that behaviour would decrease in the future. The student might seem more motivated to behave in class, presumably in order to avoid further detention (negative reinforcement).\n\nIncentive theory is a specific theory of motivation, derived partly from behaviorist principles of reinforcement, which concerns an incentive or motive to do something. The most common incentive would be a compensation. Compensation can be tangible or intangible, It helps in motivating the employees in their corporate life, students in academics and inspire to do more and more to achieve profitability in every field. Studies show that if the person receives the reward immediately, the effect is greater, and decreases as delay lengthens. Repetitive action-reward combination can cause the action to become a habit.\n\nMotivating operations, MOs, relate to the field of motivation in that they help improve understanding aspects of behaviour that are not covered by operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, the function of the reinforcer is to influence \"future behavior\". The presence of a stimulus believed to function as a reinforcer does not according to this terminology explain the current behaviour of an organism \u2013 only previous instances of reinforcement of that behavior (in the same or similar situations) do. Through the behavior-altering effect of MOs, it is possible to affect current behaviour of an individual, giving another piece of the puzzle of motivation.", "Motivation can develop through an individuals involvement within their cultural group. Personal motivation often comes from activities a person believes to be central to the everyday occurrences in their community. An example of socio-cultural theory would be social settings where people work together to solve collective problems. Although individuals will have internalized goals, they will also develop internalized goals of others, as well as new interests and goals collectively with those that they feel socially connected to. Oftentimes, it is believed that all cultural groups are motivated in the same way. However, motivation can come from different child-rearing practices and cultural behaviors that greatly vary between cultural groups.\n\nIn some indigenous cultures, collaboration between children and adults in community and household tasks is seen as very important A child from an indigenous community may spend a great deal of their time alongside family and community members doing different tasks and chores that benefit the community. After having seen the benefits of collaboration and work, and also having the opportunity to be included, the child will be intrinsically motivated to participate in similar tasks. In this example, because the adults in the community do not impose the tasks upon the children, the children therefore feel self-motivated and a desire to participate and learn through the task. As a result of the community values that surround the child, their source of motivation may vary from a different community with different values.\n\nIn more Westernized communities, where segregation between adults and children participating in work related task is a common practice. As a result of this, these adolescents demonstrate less internalized motivation to do things within their environment than their parents. However, when the motivation to participate in activities is a prominent belief within the family, the adolescents autonomy is significantly higher. This therefore demonstrating that when collaboration and non-segregative tasks are norms within a child's upbringing, their internal motivation to participate in community tasks increases. When given opportunities to work collaboratively with adults on shared tasks during childhood, children will therefore become more intrinsically motivated through adulthood.\n\nSocial motivation is tied to one's activity in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and so people are much less likely to smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction does not need to be communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork. Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives. Examples of activities that may one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for social benefit are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.\n\nSection::::Psychological theories.:Push and pull.:Push.\nPush motivations are those where people push themselves towards their goals or to achieve something, such as the desire for escape, rest and relaxation, prestige, health and fitness, adventure, and social interaction.\nHowever, with push motivation it's also easy to get discouraged when there are obstacles present in the path of achievement. Push motivation acts as a willpower and people's willpower is only as strong as the desire behind the willpower.\nAdditionally, a study has been conducted on social networking and its push and pull effects. One thing that is mentioned is \"Regret and dissatisfaction correspond to push factors because regret and dissatisfaction are the negative factors that compel users to leave their current service provider.\" So from reading this, we now know that Push motivations can also be a negative force. In this case, that negative force is regret and dissatisfaction.\n\nSection::::Psychological theories.:Push and pull.:Pull.\nPull motivation is the opposite of push. It is a type of motivation that is much stronger. \"Some of the factors are those that emerge as a result of the attractiveness of a destination as it is perceived by those with the propensity to travel. They include both tangible resources, such as beaches, recreation facilities, and cultural attractions, and traveler's perceptions and expectation, such as novelty, benefit expectation, and marketing image.\" Pull motivation can be seen as the desire to achieve a goal so badly that it seems that the goal is pulling us toward it. That is why pull motivation is stronger than push motivation. It is easier to be drawn to something rather than to push yourself for something you desire.\nIt can also be an alternative force when compared to negative force. From the same study as previously mentioned, \"Regret and dissatisfaction with an existing SNS service provider may trigger a heightened interest toward switching service providers, but such a motive will likely translate into reality in the presence of a good alternative. Therefore, alternative attractiveness can moderate the effects of regret and dissatisfaction with switching intention\" And so, pull motivation can be an attracting desire when negative influences come into the picture.\n\nSection::::Psychological theories.:Self-control.\nThe self-control aspect of motivation is increasingly considered to be a subset of emotional intelligence; it is suggested that although a person may be classed as highly intelligent (as measured by many traditional intelligence tests), they may remain unmotivated to pursue intellectual endeavours. Vroom's \"expectancy theory\" provides an account of when people may decide to exert self-control in pursuit of a particular goal.\n\nSection::::Psychological theories.:Drives.\nA drive or desire can be described as a deficiency or need that activates behavior that is aimed at a goal or an incentive. These drives are thought to originate within the individual and may not require external stimuli to encourage the behavior. Basic drives could be sparked by deficiencies such as hunger, which motivates a person to seek food whereas more subtle drives might be the desire for praise and approval, which motivates a person to behave in a manner pleasing to others.\nAnother basic drive is the sexual drive which like food motivates us because it is essential to our survival. The desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all human beings as glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire. The hormone involved in the initial onset of sexual desire is called Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The hormonal basis of both men and women's sex drives is testosterone. Men naturally have more testosterone than women do and so are more likely than women to think about sex. \n\nSection::::Psychological theories.:Drive-reduction theory.\nDrive theory grows out of the concept that people have certain biological drives, such as hunger and thirst. As time passes the strength of the drive increases if it is not satisfied (in this case by eating). Upon satisfying a drive the drive's strength is reduced. Created by Clark Hull and further developed by Kenneth Spence, the theory became well known in the 1940s and 1950s. Many of the motivational theories that arose during the 1950s and 1960s were either based on Hull's original theory or were focused on providing alternatives to the drive-reduction theory, including Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which emerged as an alternative to Hull's approach.\nDrive theory has some intuitive or folk validity. For instance when preparing food, the drive model appears to be compatible with sensations of rising hunger as the food is prepared, and, after the food has been consumed, a decrease in subjective hunger. There are several problems, however, that leave the validity of drive reduction open for debate.\n\nSection::::Psychological theories.:Cognitive dissonance theory.\nSuggested by Leon Festinger, cognitive dissonance occurs when an individual experiences some degree of discomfort resulting from an inconsistency between two cognitions: their views on the world around them, and their own personal feelings and actions. For example, a consumer may seek to reassure themselves regarding a purchase, feeling that another decision may have been preferable. Their feeling that another purchase would have been preferable is inconsistent with their action of purchasing the item. The difference between their feelings and beliefs causes dissonance, so they seek to reassure themselves.\nWhile not a theory of motivation, per se, the theory of cognitive dissonance proposes that people have a motivational drive to reduce dissonance. The cognitive miser perspective makes people want to justify things in a simple way in order to reduce the effort they put into cognition. They do this by changing their attitudes, beliefs, or actions, rather than facing the inconsistencies, because dissonance is a mental strain. Dissonance is also reduced by justifying, blaming, and denying. It is one of the most influential and extensively studied theories in social psychology.\n\nSection::::Psychological theories.:Content theories.\nThe content theory was one of the earliest theories of motivation. Content theories can also be referred to needs theories, because the theory focuses on the importance of what motivates people (needs). In other words, they try to identify what are the \"needs\" and how they relate to motivation to fulfill those needs. Another definition could be defined by Pritchard and Ashwood, is the process used to allocate energy to maximize the satisfaction of needs.\n\nSection::::Psychological theories.:Content theories.:Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\nContent theory of human motivation includes both Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.", "where Motivation is the desire for a particular outcome, Expectancy or self-efficacy is the probability of success, Value is the reward associated with the outcome, Impulsiveness is the individual's sensitivity to delay and Delay is the time to realization.\n\nSocial-cognitive models of behavior change include the constructs of motivation and volition. Motivation is seen as a process that leads to the forming of behavioral intentions. Volition is seen as a process that leads from intention to actual behavior. In other words, motivation and volition refer to goal setting and goal pursuit, respectively. Both processes require self-regulatory efforts. Several self-regulatory constructs are needed to operate in orchestration to attain goals. An example of such a motivational and volitional construct is perceived self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is supposed to facilitate the forming of behavioral intentions, the development of action plans, and the initiation of action. It can support the translation of intentions into action.", "The symptoms of mental fatigue can range from low motivation and loss of concentration to the more severe symptoms of headaches, dizziness, and impaired decision making and judgment. Mental fatigue can affect an individual\u2019s life by causing a lack of motivation, avoidance of friends and family members and changes in one\u2019s mood. The control of motivation is only understood to a limited extent. There are many different approaches of \"motivation training\", but many of these are considered pseudoscientific by critics. To understand how to control motivation it is first necessary to understand why many people lack motivation.", "Motivation is of particular interest to educational psychologists because of the crucial role it plays in student learning. However, the specific kind of motivation that is studied in the specialized setting of education differs qualitatively from the more general forms of motivation studied by psychologists in other fields.\nMotivation in education can have several effects on how students learn and how they behave towards subject matter. It can:\nBULLET::::1. Direct behavior toward particular goals\nBULLET::::2. Lead to increased effort and energy\nBULLET::::3. Increase initiation of, and persistence in, activities\nBULLET::::4. Enhance cognitive processing\nBULLET::::5. Determine what consequences are reinforcing\nBULLET::::6. Lead to improved performance.\nBecause students are not always internally motivated, they sometimes need \"situated motivation\", which is found in environmental conditions that the teacher creates.\nGenerally, motivation is conceptualized as either \"intrinsic\" or \"extrinsic\". Classically, these categories are regarded as distinct. Today, these concepts are less likely to be used as distinct categories, but instead as two ideal types that define a continuum:\nBULLET::::1. Intrinsic motivation occurs when people are internally motivated to do something because it either brings them pleasure, they think it is important, or they feel that what they are learning is significant. It has been shown that intrinsic motivation for education drops from grades 3-9 though the exact cause cannot be ascertained. Also, in younger students it has been shown that contextualizing material that would otherwise be presented in an abstract manner increases the intrinsic motivation of these students.\nBULLET::::2. Extrinsic motivation comes into play when a student is compelled to do something or act a certain way because of factors external to him or her (like money or good grades)."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

(1997) report that more than one-third of the variation in final exam scores could be attributed to procrastination. The negative association between procrastination and academic performance is recurring and consistent. Howell et al. (2006) found that, though scores on two widely used procrastination scales were not significantly associated with the grade received for an assignment, self-report measures of procrastination on the assessment itself were negatively associated with grade.\n\nIn 2005, a study conducted by Angela Chu and Jin Nam Choi and published in the \"Journal of Social Psychology\" intended to understand task performance among procrastinators with the definition of procrastination as the absence of self-regulated performance, from the 1977 work of Ellis & Knaus. In their study they identified two types of procrastination: the traditional procrastination which they denote as passive, and active procrastination where the person finds enjoyment of a goal-oriented activity only under pressure. The study calls this active procrastination positive procrastination, as it is a functioning state in a self-handicapping environment. In addition, it was observed that active procrastinators have more realistic perceptions of time and perceive more control over their time than passive procrastinators, which is considered a major differentiator between the two types. But surprisingly, active and passive procrastinators showed similar levels of academic performance. The population of the study was college students and the majority of the sample size were women and Asian in origin. Comparisons with chronic pathological procrastination traits were avoided.\n\nDifferent findings emerge when observed and self-reported procrastination are compared. Steel et al. constructed their own scales based on Silver and Sabini's \"irrational\" and \"postponement\" criteria. They also sought to measure this behavior objectively. During a course, students could complete exam practice computer exercises at their own pace, and during the supervised class time could also complete chapter quizzes. A weighted average of the times at which each chapter quiz was finished formed the measure of observed procrastination, whilst observed irrationality was quantified with the number of practice exercises that were left uncompleted. Researchers found that there was only a moderate correlation between observed and self-reported procrastination (r = 0.35). There was a very strong inverse relationship between the number of exercises completed and the measure of postponement (r = \u22120.78). Observed procrastination was very strongly negatively correlated with course grade (r = \u22120.87), as was self-reported procrastination (though less so, r = \u22120.36). As such, self-reported measures of procrastination, on which the majority of the literature is based, may not be the most appropriate measure to use in all cases. It was also found that procrastination itself may not have contributed significantly to poorer grades. Steel et al. noted that those students who completed all of the practice exercises \"tended to perform well on the final exam no matter how much they delayed.\"\n\nA 2014 panel study from Germany among several thousand university students found that increasing academic procrastination increases the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct, i.e., using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, fabrication or falsification of data and the variety of academic misconduct.

Our measure also focuses on assignment submission in line with the conceptualization of procrastination as the delay of task completion [22], but we are aware that other aspects of assignment-related activities, such as the time of first access and the frequency of attempts, can also be leveraged to measure procrastination which might lead to different results. For instance, students who start early and consistently work on assignments until before the deadline would be considered as procrastinating with our measure, but not with measures based on the time of first access [35]. More broadly, online actions captured by log data are imperfect reflections of students\u2019 underlying psychological processes and the broader contexts of these actions.

The second important factor is inclusion, which refers to a comprehensive standard that applies to everyone in a certain education system. These two factors are closely related and depend on each other for an educational system's success.\nThe growing importance of education equity is based on the premise that an individual\u2019s level of education directly correlates to future quality of life. Therefore, an academic system that practices educational equity is a strong foundation of a society that is fair and thriving. However, inequity in education is challenging to avoid, and can be broken down into inequity due to socioeconomic standing, race, gender or disability. Educational equity is also based in the historical context of the location, people and structure. History shapes the outcome of individuals within the education system.\n\nEquity recognizes that some are at a larger disadvantage than others and aims at compensating for these peoples misfortunes and disabilities to ensure that everyone can attain the same type of healthy lifestyle.

Equity aims at making sure that everyone's lifestyle is equal even if it may come at the cost of unequal distribution of access and goods. Social justice leaders in education strive to ensure equitable outcomes for their students.\n\nThe American Library Association defines equality as: \u201caccess to channels of communication and sources of information that is made available on even terms to all--a level playing field--is derived from the concept of fairness as uniform distribution, where everyone is entitled to the same level of access and can avail themselves if they so choose.\u201d In this definition of equality no one person has an unfair advantage. Everyone is given equal opportunities and accessibility and are then free to do what they please with it. However, this is not to say that everyone is then inherently equal. Some people may choose to seize these open and equal opportunities while others let them pass by.\n\nIncome has always played an important role in shaping academic success.

Parents of a higher SES are more willing to donate large sums of money to a certain institution to better improve their child's chances of acceptance, along with other extravagant measures. This creates an unfair advantage and distinct class barrier.\n\nThe extraordinarily high cost of the many prestigious high schools and universities in the United States makes an attempt at a \"level playing field\" for all students not so level. High-achieving low-income students do not have the means to attend selective schools that better prepare a student for later success. Because of this, low-income students do not even attempt to apply to the top-tier schools for which they are more than qualified. In addition, neighborhoods generally segregated by class leave lower-income students in lower-quality schools. For higher-quality schooling, students in low-income areas would have to take public transport which they can't pay for. Fewer than 30 percent of students in the bottom quarter of incomes even enroll in a four-year school and among that group, fewer than half graduate.\n\nAnother contributor to the inequality in the education system is tracking. Tracking sorts students into different classes or groups based on ability or future plans. The point of tracking is to create an environment in which the student's abilities match both the curriculum as well as the other student's in the class. This separation, however, creates an inequality within itself. Starting at an extremely young age, the sorting of students mimics a hierarchy similar to what may form later in life.

The quality of teaching and curricula vary between tracks and as a result, those of the lower track are disadvantaged with inferior resources, teachers, etc. In many cases, tracking stunts students who may develop the ability to excel past their original placement.\n\nRacial equity in education means the assignment of students to public schools and within schools without regard to their race. This includes providing students with a full opportunity for participation in all educational programs regardless of their race.\n\nThe struggle for equality of access to formal education and equality of excellent educational outcomes is part of the history of education in this country and is tied up with the economic, political, social history of the peoples who are part of it. From the beginning of this nation, there were many barriers to the schooling and education of girls and racial, national origin, and language groups not from the dominant culture. Approaches and resources for achieving equality and equity in the public schooling of girls and ethnic, racial, and language minority groups are still evolving.\n\nGender equity in practicality refers to both male and female concerns, yet most of the gender bias is against women in the developing world. Gender discrimination in education has been very evident and underlying problem in many countries, especially in developing countries where cultural and societal stigma continue to hinder growth and prosperity for women. Global Campaign for Education (GCE) followed a survey called \"Gender Discrimination in Violation of Rights of Women and Girls\" states that one tenth of girls in primary school are 'unhappy' and this number increases to one fifth by the time they reach secondary schools. Some of the reasonings that girls provided include harassment, restorations to freedom, and an inherent lack of opportunities, compared to boys.", "The highest performing education systems are those that combine quality with equity. Equity in education means that personal or social circumstances such as gender, ethnic origin or family background, are not obstacles to achieving educational potential (definition of fairness) and that all individuals reach at least a basic minimum level of skills (definition of inclusion). In these education systems, the vast majority of students have the opportunity to attain high-level skills, regardless of their own personal and socio-economic circumstances."], "wikipedia-33541929": ["Section::::Theories about the origin of the racial achievement gap.:Education Debt.\nEducation debt is a theory developed by Gloria Ladson-Billings, a pedagogical theorist.  In her theory of education debt, she likens the focus of the achievement gap to the United States current focus on the national deficit. She argues that instead the true issue is debt rather than deficit: an education debt to African Americans, Native Americans, and Latino/as.  As defined by a colleague of Ladson-Billings, Professor Emeritus Robert Haveman, education debt is the \u201cforegone schooling resources that we could have (should have) been investing in (primarily) low income kids, which deficit leads to a variety of social problems (e.g. crime, low productivity, low wages, low labor force participation) that require on-going public investment\u201d. The education debt has historical, economic, sociopolitical and moral components; the structure of the education debt theory makes is a logical cause of the racial achievement gap.", "These factors directly determine the access of the parents to time and resources to dedicate to their children's development. These factors also indirectly determine the home environment and parents' educational expectations of their children. For example, children from poor families have lower academic performance in kindergarten than children from middle to upper-class backgrounds, but children from poor families who had cognitively stimulating materials in the home demonstrated higher rates of academic achievement in kindergarten. Additionally, parents of children living in poverty are less likely to have cognitively stimulating materials in the home for their children and are less likely to be involved in their child's school. The quality of language that the student uses is affected by family's socioeconomic backgrounds, which is another factor in the academic achievement gap.", "The stereotype threat both perpetuates and is caused by the achievement gap. Furthermore, students of low academic performance demonstrate low expectations for themselves and self-handicapping tendencies. Psychologists Claude Steele, Joshua Aronson, and Steven Spencer, have found that Microaggression such as passing reminders that someone belongs to one group or another (i.e.: a group stereotyped as inferior in academics) can affect test performance.\nSteele, Aronson and Spencer, have examined and performed experiments to see how stereotypes can threaten how students evaluate themselves, which then alters academic identity and intellectual performance. Steele tested the stereotype threat theory by giving Black and White college students a half-hour test using difficult questions from the verbal Graduate Record Examination (GRE). In the stereotype-threat condition, they told students the test diagnosed intellectual ability. In saying that the test diagnoses intellectual ability it can potentially elicit the stereotype that Blacks are less intelligent than Whites. In the no-stereotype-threat condition, they told students that the test was a problem-solving lab task that said nothing about ability. This made stereotypes irrelevant. In the stereotype threat condition, Blacks who were evenly matched with Whites in their group by SAT scores, performed worse compared to their White counterparts. In the experiments with no stereotype threat, Blacks performed slightly better than in those with a stereotype threat, though still significantly worse than whites. Aronson believes the study of stereotype threat offers some \"exciting and encouraging answers to these old questions [of achievement gaps] by looking at the psychology of stigma -- the way human beings respond to negative stereotypes about their racial or gender group\". When pressed, Steele, Aronson, and Spenser, acknowledge that their experiments on stereotype threat only explain a modest portion of test-score gaps. However, their findings have consistently been erroneously attributed to explaining the entirety of the test score gap. The American Psychological Association is one such institution that misuses the study to posit that stereotype threat undercuts the tendency of evolutionary psychologists to lay the blame on genetic and cultural factors, such as whether African Americans \"value\" education. Researchers from Heterodox Academy, a think tank dedicated to pursuing intellectual diversity in academia, posit that the tendency of some social scientists to over emphasise the potency of stereotype threat, has to do with their loyalty to politically correct clean slate ideology, rather than objective reasoning. Adherence to such dogma therefore permits these individuals to dismiss the possibility of less palatable explanations for racial group disparities, such as genetics and culture.\nSection::::Implications of the achievement gap.:Political representation.\nAnother consequence of the racial achievement gap can be seen in the lack of representation of minority groups in public office. Studies have shown that higher socioeconomic status\u2014in terms of income, occupation, and/or educational attainment\u2014is correlated with higher participation in politics. This participation is defined as \"individual or collective action at the national or local level that supports or opposes state structures, authorities, and/or decisions regarding allocation of public goods\"; this action ranges from engaging in activities such as voting in elections to running for public office.\nSince median income per capita for minority groups(Except Asians) is lower than that of White Americans, and since minority groups(Except Asians) are more likely to occupy less gainful employment and achieve lower education levels, there is a lowered likelihood of political participation among minority groups. Education attainment is highly correlated with earnings and occupation. And there is a proven disparity between educational attainment of White Americans and minority groups, with only 30% of bachelor's degrees awarded in 2009 to minority groups. Thus socioeconomic status\u2014and therefore political participation\u2014is correlated with race. Research has shown that African Americans, Latino Americans, and Asian Americans are less politically active, by varying degrees, than White Americans.\nA consequence of underrepresentation of minority groups in leadership is incongruence between policy and community needs. A study conducted by Kenneth J. Meier and Robert E. England of 82 of the largest urban school districts in the United States showed that African American membership on the school board of these districts led to more policies encouraging more African American inclusion in policy considerations. It has been shown that both passive and active representation of minority groups serves to align constituent policy preference and representation of these opinions, and thereby facilitate political empowerment of these groups.\nSection::::Implications of the achievement gap.:Special programs.\nAchievement gaps among students may also manifest themselves in the racial and ethnic composition of special education and gifted education programs. Typically, African American and Hispanic students are enrolled in greater numbers in special education programs than their numbers would indicate in most populations, while these groups are underrepresented in gifted programs. Research shows that these disproportionate enrollment trends may be a consequence of the differences in educational achievement among groups.\nSection::::Efforts to narrow the achievement gap.\nThe United States has seen a variety of different attempts to narrow the racial achievement gap. These attempts include focusing on the importance of early childhood education, using federal standards based reforms, and implementing institutional changes. Despite the fact that there are efforts to narrow the achievement gap, the consequences of the achievement gap will still be felt for many years. For instance, The Oakland achievement gap grew by 11 percent between 2011 and 2013. This rate is alarming because it is a quicker pace than 80 percent of other major nationwide cities. This means that Oakland's achievement gap is larger than half of California's cities."], "wikipedia-1040219": ["The achievement gap in the United States is the observed, persistent disparity in measures of educational performance among subgroups of U.S. students, especially groups defined by socioeconomic status (SES), race/ethnicity and gender.

It is widely accepted and noted by scholars that ideas around individual outcome in schools varies based on various demographics.

The Discourse is based on evidence and assumptions of why primarily poor students of color do not perform at the same levels as their more affluent White and certain Asian group counterparts- it creates language to how schools and communities can be organized more optimally to help students and schools produce more equitable and successful outcomes. The Achievement Gap also addresses a gender gap achievement, and standardized test score gaps broadly across countries, notably with standardized examinations on STEM subjects. The Discourse can also be seen as a turning away from traditional explanations of performance in school as individualistic, to the creation of cultural framework understanding to help explain what conventions hinder and produce successful students. \"Under performing, adequate yearly progress (AYP), highly qualified, below basic, and proficient\" are some terms used to mark good and bad aspects of schools, their teachers, and their students which in turn reifies the Achievement Gap theory.

Even as late as 1947, about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. However, by 1969, illiteracy as it had been traditionally defined, had been largely eradicated among African Americans\u2014the number of among young adults was less than one percent, though African Americans still lag in more stringent definitions of document literacy. Inability to read, write or speak English in America today is largely an issue for immigrants, mostly from Asia and Latin America.\n\nSection::::Racial achievement gap.:Immigrants.\nEducational attainment rates change when it comes to comparing the same races against immigrants or foreign born students. Black African and Caribbean immigrant groups to the U.S report having higher levels of education than any other group. Of all foreign-born U.S. residents, foreign born Africans (those who come from the African continent) nowadays have a higher level of educational attainment than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States. They tend to be highly educated and be fluent in English. This trend was first reported in the 1990s by the \"Journal of Blacks in Higher Education\", and still continues today.\nAccording to data from the 2000 United States Census, \"43.8 percent of African immigrants had achieved a college degree, compared with 42.5 of Asian Americans, 28.9 percent of immigrants from Europe, Russia and Canada and 23.1 percent of the U.S. population as a whole.\" The educational attainment amount varies by group. According to the U.S. Census, out of the African populations, Nigerians reported to having the highest level of education.\n\nSection::::Racial achievement gap.:High school graduation.\n\"Completed High School age 25-29 (1998)\"\nUS Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans age 25 to 29 had completed high school, lagging only slightly behind 93 percent for whites. For all over the age of 25, clear majorities of whites, Asian Americans and African Americans had graduated at 88 percent, 85 percent and 77 percent, respectively. 56 percent, or barely over half of Hispanics 25 and over, had completed high school.\n\nSection::::Racial achievement gap.:Income and class.\nSAT scores vs income and race\nSource: 1995 College Board SAT Profiles\nConservative African American scholars such as Thomas Sowell observe that while SAT scores are lower for students with less parental education and income. Asian Americans who took the SAT with incomes below $10,000 score 482 in math in 1995, comparable to whites earning $30\u201340,000 and higher and blacks over $70,000. Test scores in middle-income black communities, such as Prince George County, are still not comparable to those in non-black suburbs.\n\nSection::::Racial achievement gap.:State standards.\nMost state tests showing African American failure rates anywhere from two to four times the rate of whites, such as Washington State's WASL test, and only half to one-quarter as likely to achieve a high score, even though these tests were designed to eliminate the negative effects of bias associated with standardized multiple choice tests. It is a top goal of education reform to eliminate the \"Education gap\" between all races, though skeptics question whether legislation such as No Child Left Behind truly closes the gap just by raising expectations. Others, such as Alfie Kohn, observe it may merely penalize those who do not score as well as the most educated ethnic and income groups.\n\nSection::::Racial achievement gap.:Special programs.\nAchievement gaps among students may also manifest themselves in the racial and ethnic composition of special education and gifted education programs. Typically, African American and Hispanic students are enrolled in greater numbers in special education programs than their numbers would indicate in most populations, while these groups are underrepresented in gifted programs. Research shows that these disproportionate enrollment trends may be a consequence of the differences in educational achievement among groups.\n\nSection::::Gender achievement gap in the United States.\nFor the past fifty years, there has been a gap in the educational achievement of males and females in the United States, but which gender has been disadvantaged has fluctuated over the years. In the 1970s and 1980s, data showed girls trailing behind boys in a variety of academic performance measures, specifically in test scores in math and science.\nData in the last twenty years shows the general trend of girls outperforming boys in academic achievement in terms of class grades across all subjects and college graduation rates, but boys scoring higher on standardized tests and being better represented in the higher-paying and more prestigious STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math). Male students consistently achieved worse school marks than female students from 1913 to 2011 in all countries for which there is data."], "wikipedia-33541929": ["BULLET::::- In mathematics, a 21-point difference at the 4th grade level and a 26-point difference at the 8th grade level.\nBULLET::::- In reading, there is a 25-point difference at the 4th grade level and a 24-point difference at the 8th grade level (NAEP, 2011).\nData from the October 2001 Current Population Survey (CPS) show that black and Hispanic students were more likely to have dropped out of high school between October 2000 and October 2001 than were white or Asians/Pacific Islander students. During this period, 6.3% of black and 8.8% of Hispanic high school students dropped out compared to 4.1% of white and 2.3% of Asian/Pacific Islander high school students.\nAlso in 2001, the status dropout rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders ages 16\u201324 was lower than for any other 16- through 24-year-olds. Specifically, the status rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders was 3.6%, compared with 27.0% for Hispanics, 20.9% for blacks, and 7.3% for whites.\nIn 2015, the average SAT scores on the math section were 598 for Asian-Americans, 534 for whites, 457 for Hispanic Latinos and 428 for blacks.\nSpecifically, they found that about 72% of White students who have completed high school enrolled in college the same year, compared to 44% for Black students, and 50% for Hispanic students. Furthermore, trends in undergraduate and graduate enrollment have shown increases in all ethnicity groups, but the largest gap still exists for Black student enrollment.\nThe 6-year national college graduation rate is 59% for White students, 51% for Hispanic students, 46% for Black females, and 35% for Black males.", "The quality of language that the student uses is affected by family's socioeconomic backgrounds, which is another factor in the academic achievement gap.\n\nThese disparities in socioeconomic status between minority groups and White Americans help explain differences in parenting styles, family structure, and the resultant educational achievement of minority children. However, the racial gaps persists when comparing families with similar income. Whites from families with incomes below $10,000 had a mean SAT test score that was 61 points higher than blacks whose families had incomes of between $80,000 and $100,000.\n\nChildren growing up in single-parent homes are more likely to not finish school and generally obtain less years of schooling than those in two-parent homes. Specifically, boys growing in homes with only their mothers are more likely to receive poorer grades and display behavioral problems.\n\nIn particular, it has been found that minority students from cultures with views that generally do not align with the mainstream cultural views have a harder time in school. Furthermore, views of the value of education differ by minority groups as well as members within each group. Both Hispanic and African-American youths often receive mixed messages about the importance of education, and often end up performing below their academic potential.\n\nSurveys have shown that while Latino American families would like their children to have a formal education, they also place high value on getting jobs, marrying, and having children as early as possible, all of which conflict with the goal of educational achievement.\n\nThe quality of school that a student attends and the socioeconomic status of the student's residential neighborhood are two factors that can affect a student's academic performance.\n\nIn the United States, the financing of most public schools is based on local property taxes This system means that schools located in areas with lower real estate values have proportionately less money to spend per pupil than schools located in areas with higher real estate values. This system has also maintained a \"funding segregation:\" because minority students are much more likely to live in a neighborhood with lower property values, they are much more likely to attend a school that receives significantly lower funding.\n\nUsing property taxes to fund public schools contributes to school inequality. Lower-funded schools are more likely to have (1) lower-paid teachers; (2) higher student-teacher ratios, meaning less individual attention for each student; (3) older books; (4) fewer extracurricular activities, which have been shown to increase academic achievement; (5) poorly maintained school buildings and grounds; and (6) less access to services like school nursing and social workers. All of these factors can affect student performance and perpetuate inequalities between students of different races.", "Differences in the academic performance of African-American and White students exist even in schools that are desegregated and diverse, and studies have shown that a school's racial mix does not seem to have much effect on changes in reading scores after sixth grade, or on math scores at any age. In fact, minority students in segregated-minority schools have more optimism and greater educational aspirations as well as achievements than minority students in segregated-white schools. This can be attributed to various factors, including the attitudes of faculty and staff at segregated-white schools and the effect of stereotype threat.\nResearch has shown time and again that the wealth and income of parents is a primary factor influencing student achievement . A low socioeconomic background can have negative effects on a child's educational achievement before even starting school; indeed, research has shown that the achievement gap is present between races before starting formal education. On average, when entering kindergarten, African-American students are one year behind White students in terms of vocabulary and basic math skills, and this gap continues to grow as a child's education continues.", "The stereotype threat both perpetuates and is caused by the achievement gap. Furthermore, students of low academic performance demonstrate low expectations for themselves and self-handicapping tendencies. Psychologists Claude Steele, Joshua Aronson, and Steven Spencer, have found that Microaggression such as passing reminders that someone belongs to one group or another (i.e.: a group stereotyped as inferior in academics) can affect test performance.\nSteele, Aronson and Spencer, have examined and performed experiments to see how stereotypes can threaten how students evaluate themselves, which then alters academic identity and intellectual performance. Steele tested the stereotype threat theory by giving Black and White college students a half-hour test using difficult questions from the verbal Graduate Record Examination (GRE). In the stereotype-threat condition, they told students the test diagnosed intellectual ability. In saying that the test diagnoses intellectual ability it can potentially elicit the stereotype that Blacks are less intelligent than Whites. In the no-stereotype-threat condition, they told students that the test was a problem-solving lab task that said nothing about ability. This made stereotypes irrelevant. In the stereotype threat condition, Blacks who were evenly matched with Whites in their group by SAT scores, performed worse compared to their White counterparts. In the experiments with no stereotype threat, Blacks performed slightly better than in those with a stereotype threat, though still significantly worse than whites. Aronson believes the study of stereotype threat offers some \"exciting and encouraging answers to these old questions [of achievement gaps] by looking at the psychology of stigma -- the way human beings respond to negative stereotypes about their racial or gender group\". When pressed, Steele, Aronson, and Spenser, acknowledge that their experiments on stereotype threat only explain a modest portion of test-score gaps. However, their findings have consistently been erroneously attributed to explaining the entirety of the test score gap. The American Psychological Association is one such institution that misuses the study to posit that stereotype threat undercuts the tendency of evolutionary psychologists to lay the blame on genetic and cultural factors, such as whether African Americans \"value\" education. Researchers from Heterodox Academy, a think tank dedicated to pursuing intellectual diversity in academia, posit that the tendency of some social scientists to over emphasise the potency of stereotype threat, has to do with their loyalty to politically correct clean slate ideology, rather than objective reasoning. Adherence to such dogma therefore permits these individuals to dismiss the possibility of less palatable explanations for racial group disparities, such as genetics and culture.\nAnother consequence of the racial achievement gap can be seen in the lack of representation of minority groups in public office. Studies have shown that higher socioeconomic status\u2014in terms of income, occupation, and/or educational attainment\u2014is correlated with higher participation in politics. This participation is defined as \"individual or collective action at the national or local level that supports or opposes state structures, authorities, and/or decisions regarding allocation of public goods\"; this action ranges from engaging in activities such as voting in elections to running for public office.\nSince median income per capita for minority groups(Except Asians) is lower than that of White Americans, and since minority groups(Except Asians) are more likely to occupy less gainful employment and achieve lower education levels, there is a lowered likelihood of political participation among minority groups. Education attainment is highly correlated with earnings and occupation. And there is a proven disparity between educational attainment of White Americans and minority groups, with only 30% of bachelor's degrees awarded in 2009 to minority groups. Thus socioeconomic status\u2014and therefore political participation\u2014is correlated with race. Research has shown that African Americans, Latino Americans, and Asian Americans are less politically active, by varying degrees, than White Americans.\nAchievement gaps among students may also manifest themselves in the racial and ethnic composition of special education and gifted education programs. Typically, African American and Hispanic students are enrolled in greater numbers in special education programs than their numbers would indicate in most populations, while these groups are underrepresented in gifted programs.

In the U.S. in 2003, 72 percent of female students graduated, compared with 65 percent of male students. The gender gap in graduation rates is particularly large for minority students. Men are under-represented among both graduate students and those who successfully complete master's and doctoral degrees in the U.S. Causes include boys having worse self-regulation skills than girls and being more sensitive to school-quality and home environment than girls. Boys perceiving education as feminine and lacking educated male role-models also contributes to males being less likely to complete college. In the U.S., male students perform worse on reading tests and read less than their female counterparts in part because males are more physically active, more aggressive, less compliant, and because school reading curricula do not match their interests. Teacher Bias in grading accounts for 21% of the male deficit in grades.

It creates an inequality of learning between children from families of a high SES and children from families of a low SES.

It is significant because White students tend to achieve far more academically compared to Black and Latino students.

It is important to understand that these discrepancies have long-term achievement effects on Latino and Black students. There are several factors that can explain the achievement gap. Among some of the most studied and popular theories are that predominantly Black/Latino schools are concentrated in low SES neighborhoods that do not receive adequate resources to invest in their student\u2019s education (such as the ability to pay for qualified teachers) and that parental influence in Black and Latino families lags behind White families in terms of involvement in school.

Five out of every 100 students enrolled in high school in October 2000 left school before October 2001 without successfully completing a high school program. The percentage of students who were event dropouts decreased from 1972 through 1987. However, despite some year-to-year fluctuations, the percentage of students dropping out of school each year has stayed relatively the same since 1987. Data from the October 2001 Current Population Survey (CPS) show that black and Hispanic students were more likely to have dropped out of high school between October 2000 and October 2001 than were white or Asians/Pacific Islander students. During this period, 6.3% of black and 8.8% of Hispanic high school students dropped out compared to 4.1% of white and 2.3% of Asian/Pacific Islander high school students.\nAccording to the US Department of Education, status dropout rates measure the percentage of individuals who are not enrolled in high school and who lack a high school credential, independent of when they dropped out. Status rates are higher than event rates because they include all dropouts in this age range, regardless of when they last attended school or whether or not they ever entered the US education system. In October 2001, about 3.8 million 16- through 24-year-olds were not enrolled in a high school program and had not completed high school. These individuals accounted for 10.7% of the 35.2 million 16- through 24-year-olds in the United States in 2001. In 1972, the white status dropout rate was 40% and the black status dropout rate was 49%. Because the black rate declined more steeply than the white rate, there has been a narrowing of the gap between the dropout rates for blacks and whites. However, this narrowing occurred in the 1980s, and the gap between whites and blacks has remained fairly constant since 1990. The percentage of Hispanics who were status dropouts has remained higher than that of blacks and whites in every year since 1970. Even though Hispanics represented approximately the same percentage of the young adult population as did blacks, Hispanics were disproportionately represented among status dropouts in 2001. Also in 2001, the status dropout rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders ages 16\u201324 was lower than for any other 16- through 24-year-olds. Specifically, the status rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders was 3.6%, compared with 27.0% for Hispanics, 20.9% for blacks, and 7.3% for whites.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:High school completion rates.\nStatus completion rates measure the percentage of a given population that has a high school credential, regardless of when the credential was earned. In 2001, 86.5% of 18- through 24-year-olds not enrolled in elementary or secondary school had completed high school. Status completion rates increased from 82.8% in 1972 to 85.6% in 1990. Since 1991, the rate has shown no consistent trend and has fluctuated between 84.8% and 86.5%. High school status completion rates for white and black young adults increased between the early 1970s and 1990 but has remained relatively the same since 1990. Specifically, status completion rates for white students increased from 86.0% in 1972 to 89.6% in 1990. Since 1990, white completion rates have remained in the range of 89.4\u201391.8%. In 2001, 91.0% of white and 85.6% of black 18- through 24-year-olds had completed high school. The percentage of black students completing high school rose from 72.1% in 1972 to 85.6% in 2001. The gap between black and white completion rates narrowed between 1972 and 2001. In 2001, 65.7% of all Hispanic 18- through 24-year- olds completed high school. This percentage compares to 91.0% of whites, 85.6% of blacks, and 96.1% of Asians/Pacific Islanders. Essentially, in 2001, whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders were more likely than their black and Hispanic peers to have completed high school. Also, whites completed high school at a higher rate than both blacks and Hispanic students. Black students completed high school at a higher rate than Hispanics.\nThe four-year completion rate is the percentage of 9th-grade students who left school over a subsequent 4-year period while also completing a high school credential. Data for the 4-year completion rate calculations are taken from the Common Core of Data (CCD). The 4-year completion rate calculation is dependent on the availability of dropout estimates over a 4-year span, and current counts of completers. Because dropout rate information was missing for many states during the 4-year period considered by the US Department of Education, 4- year completion rate estimates for the 2000-01 school year are only available for 39 states. Since data were not available from all states, an overall national rate could not be calculated. However, among reporting states, the high school 4-year completion rates for public school students ranged from a high of 90.1% in North Dakota to a low of 65.0% in Louisiana.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:SAT scores.\nRacial and ethnic variations in SAT scores follow a similar pattern to other racial achievement gaps. In 1990, the average SAT was 528 for Asian-Americans, 491 for whites, 429 for Mexican Americans and 385 for blacks. 34% of Asians compared with 20% of whites, 3% of blacks, 7% of Mexican Americans, and 9% of Native Americans scored above a 600 on the SAT math section. On the SAT verbal section in 1990, whites scored an average of 442, compared with 410 for Asians, 352 for blacks, 380 for Mexican Americans, and 388 for Native Americans. \nIn 2015, the average SAT scores on the math section were 598 for Asian-Americans, 534 for whites, 457 for Hispanic Latinos and 428 for blacks. \nAdditionally, 10% of Asian-Americans, 8% of whites, 3% of Mexican Americans, 3% of Native Americans and 2% of blacks scored above 600 on the SAT verbal section in 1990.\nRace gaps on the SATs are especially pronounced at the tails of the distribution. In a perfectly equal distribution, the racial breakdown of scores at every point in the distribution should ideally mirror the demographic composition of test-takers as whole i.e. 51% whites, 21% Hispanic Latinos, 14% blacks, and 14% Asian-Americans. But ironically, among the highest top scorers, those scoring between a 750 and 800 (perfect scores) over 60% are East Asians of Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean and Han Chinese descent, while only 33% are white, compared to 5% Hispanic Latinos and 2% blacks.\nThere are some limitations to the data which may mean that, if anything, the race gap is being understated. The ceiling on the SAT score may, for example, understate the achievement and full potential of East Asians of Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean and Han Chinese descent. If the exam was redesigned to increase score variance (add harder and easier questions than it currently has), the achievement gap across racial groups could be even more wider and pronounced. In other words, if the math section was scored between 0 and 1000, we might see more complete tails on both the right and the left. More East Asians score between 750 and 800 than score between 700 and 750, suggesting that many East Asians of Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean and Han Chinese descent could be scoring high above 800 if the test allowed them to.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:College enrollment and graduation rates.\nThe US Department in Education demonstrates performance of different ethnic groups in colleges and universities. Specifically, they found that about 72% of White students who have completed high school enrolled in college the same year, compared to 44% for Black students, and 50% for Hispanic students. Furthermore, trends in undergraduate and graduate enrollment have shown increases in all ethnicity groups, but the largest gap still exists for Black student enrollment. Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islanders student enrollment have experienced the most growth since 1976.

In particular, our method quantifies what part of the genetic component of trait 1 is also causal for trait 2 using mixed fourth moments $E(\\alpha_1^2\\alpha_1\\alpha_2)$ and $E(\\alpha_2^2\\alpha_1\\alpha_2)$ of the bivariate effect size distribution.

We validated this approach in extensive simulations. Across 52 traits (average $N=331$k), we identified 30 putative genetically causal relationships, many novel, including an effect of LDL cholesterol on decreased bone mineral density.

This pursuit of equity is motivated by long-standing disparities in educational access, experiences, and outcomes across students from different sociodemographic groups [ 17] resulting from systemic injustice in society. In learning analytics, centering equity advances the promise of challenging inequitable structures and improving the education system [ 41]. This vision requires approaching learning analytics research and applications through a few different perspectives, such as algorithmic fairness [ 4, 23], value-sensitive and human-centered design [7, 10], and critical theories [45]. The foundation of these inquiries is that the identities of individual students involved are known, so that researchers or practitioners can observe the unique experience of vulnerable and marginalized student populations, which might differ from that of their majority counterparts and be masked in population-level analyses. However, due to administrative constraints, privacy concerns, and other limitations, a large share of existing learning analytics research does not analyze students\u2019 sociodemographic characteristics [ 30, 43] and therefore runs the risk of misunderstanding students from underserved communities and reproducing existing inequities even with technically sound models.

Given the multifaceted nature of procrastination established in psychological research [37], we acknowledge that any single behavioral measure can only capture certain aspects of procrastination, and that our approach might be a more scalable and convenient, but not necessarily more accurate, measure of procrastination. For example, even on the same platform, assignments have varying levels of importance, with some being frequent low-stakes quizzes attached to individual pieces of course material and others being high-stakes final project submissions. Our current approach quantifies procrastination without accounting for these assignment details and might overweight less problematic \u2018procrastination\u2019 in the pooled results. Our measure also focuses on assignment submission in line with the conceptualization of procrastination as the delay of task completion [22], but we are aware that other aspects of assignment-related activities, such as the time of first access and the frequency of attempts, can also be leveraged to measure procrastination which might lead to different results. For instance, students who start early and consistently work on assignments until before the deadline would be considered as procrastinating with our measure, but not with measures based on the time of first access [35]. More broadly, online actions captured by log data are imperfect reflections of students\u2019 underlying psychological processes and the broader contexts of these actions. Students identified as procrastinating might be preoccupied with other essential tasks and consciously plan a late start on the focal assignment.

This pursuit of equity is motivated by long-standing disparities in educational access, experiences, and outcomes across students from different sociodemographic groups [ 17] resulting from systemic injustice in society. In learning analytics, centering equity advances the promise of challenging inequitable structures and improving the education system [ 41]. This vision requires approaching learning analytics research and applications through a few different perspectives, such as algorithmic fairness [ 4, 23], value-sensitive and human-centered design [7, 10], and critical theories [45]. The foundation of these inquiries is that the identities of individual students involved are known, so that researchers or practitioners can observe the unique experience of vulnerable and marginalized student populations, which might differ from that of their majority counterparts and be masked in population-level analyses. However, due to administrative constraints, privacy concerns, and other limitations, a large share of existing learning analytics research does not analyze students\u2019 sociodemographic characteristics [ 30, 43] and therefore runs the risk of misunderstanding students from underserved communities and reproducing existing inequities even with technically sound models.

Given the multifaceted nature of procrastination established in psychological research [37], we acknowledge that any single behavioral measure can only capture certain aspects of procrastination, and that our approach might be a more scalable and convenient, but not necessarily more accurate, measure of procrastination. For example, even on the same platform, assignments have varying levels of importance, with some being frequent low-stakes quizzes attached to individual pieces of course material and others being high-stakes final project submissions. Our current approach quantifies procrastination without accounting for these assignment details and might overweight less problematic \u2018procrastination\u2019 in the pooled results. Our measure also focuses on assignment submission in line with the conceptualization of procrastination as the delay of task completion [22], but we are aware that other aspects of assignment-related activities, such as the time of first access and the frequency of attempts, can also be leveraged to measure procrastination which might lead to different results. For instance, students who start early and consistently work on assignments until before the deadline would be considered as procrastinating with our measure, but not with measures based on the time of first access [35]. More broadly, online actions captured by log data are imperfect reflections of students\u2019 underlying psychological processes and the broader contexts of these actions. Students identified as procrastinating might be preoccupied with other essential tasks and consciously plan a late start on the focal assignment. A more concerning situation might be that students procrastinate as a result of anxiety and depression caused by challenging life events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

If systematic differences in procrastination behavior exist across sociodemographic groups, they may also contribute to achievement gaps, considering that procrastination is largely negatively associated with academic performance in prior research. We therefore investigate these questions in the context of assignment submission using campus-wide learning management system (LMS) data from a large U.S. research university.

For example, racially minoritized students may experience increased anxiety and reduced self-efficacy due to prevailing stereotypes in their educational environment [29, 36, 39]; this may contribute to increased procrastination behavior and reduced performance, which in turn lowers self-efficacy and raises anxiety in a negative feedback loop [14, 27].

This complexity often exposes students from marginalized backgrounds to additional obstacles due to systemic issues of equity and inclusion, such as prevailing stereotypes on campus [ 29, 36, 39], experiences of cultural mismatch [ 40], and financial hardship [ 16, 18].

For example, racially minoritized students may experience increased anxiety and reduced self-efficacy due to prevailing stereotypes in their educational environment [29, 36, 39]; this may contribute to increased procrastination behavior and reduced performance, which in turn lowers self-efficacy and raises anxiety in a negative feedback loop [14, 27].

A course is usually an individual subject. Students may receive a grade and academic credit after completion of the course.\nIn India, United Kingdom, Australia and Singapore, as well as parts of Canada, a course is the entire programme of studies required to complete a university degree, and the word \"unit\" or \"module\" would be used to refer to an academic course as it is referred to in other parts of the world, for example North America and the rest of Europe.\nIn between the two, in South Africa, a course officially is the collection of all courses (in the American sense, these are often called \"modules\") over a year or semester, though the American usage is common. In the Philippines, a course can be an individual subject (usually referred to by faculty and school officials) or the entire programme (usually referred to by students and outsiders).\nCourses are time-limited in most universities worldwide, lasting anywhere between several weeks to several semesters. They can either be compulsory material or \"elective\". An elective is usually not a required course, but there are a certain number of non-specific electives that are required for certain majors.\nSection::::Types of courses.\nCourses are made up of individual sessions, typically on a fixed weekly schedule.\nThere are different formats of course in universities:\nBULLET::::- the lecture course, where the instructor gives lectures with minimal interaction;\nBULLET::::- the seminar, where students prepare and present their original written work for discussion and critique;\nBULLET::::- the colloquium or reading course, where the instructor assigns readings for each session which are then discussed by the members;\nBULLET::::- the tutorial course, where one or a small number of students work on a topic and meet with the instructor weekly for discussion and guidance.\nBULLET::::- the Directed Individual Study course, where a student requests to create and title an area of study for themselves which is more concentrated and in-depth than a standard course. It is directed under a tenured faculty member and approved by a department chair or possibly the dean within that specific college;\nBULLET::::- the laboratory course, where most work takes place in a laboratory.\nMany courses combine these formats. Lecture courses often include weekly discussion sections with smaller groups of students led by the principal instructor, another instructor, or teaching assistant. Laboratory courses often combine lectures, discussion sections, and laboratory sessions.\nStudents are expected to do various kinds of work for a course:\nBULLET::::- Attending course sessions.\nBULLET::::- Reading and studying course readings assigned in the course syllabus.\nBULLET::::- Discussing material they have read.\nBULLET::::- Writing short and long papers based on assigned reading and their own library research.\nBULLET::::- Completing homework or problem sets.\nBULLET::::- Completing laboratory exercises.\nBULLET::::- Taking quizzes and examinations.\nThe exact work required depends on the discipline, the course, and the particular instructor. Unlike most European university courses, grades are generally determined by all of these kinds of work, not only the final examination.\nSection::::Elective and required courses.\nAn elective course is one chosen by a student from a number of optional subjects or courses in a curriculum, as opposed to a required course which the student must take. While required courses (sometimes called \"core courses\" or \"general education courses\") are deemed essential for an academic degree, elective courses tend to be more specialized. Elective courses usually have fewer students than the required courses.\nThe term elective is also used for a period of medical study conducted away from the student's home medical school, often abroad. Motivations for choosing such a program include a wish to experience other cultures and to learn how to work in the clinical situations in other countries.\nTypically, North American universities require students to achieve both breadth of knowledge across disciplines and depth of knowledge in a particular chosen subject area, known as a major. Thus, students of the Arts or Humanities are required to take some science courses, and vice versa. Normally, students are free to choose their particular electives from among a wide range of courses offered by their university, as long as the students possess the prerequisite knowledge to understand the subject matter being taught. An English major, for example, might also study one or two years of chemistry, biology or physics as well as mathematics and a foreign language.\nElective courses are also offered in the third and fourth years of university, though the choice is more restrictive and will depend upon the particular major the student has chosen. For example, at the University of British Columbia, students intending to specialize in Sanskrit as part of a major in Asian language and culture will usually have to complete several Sanskrit and Hindustani or Punjabi courses during the first two years of university, as well as additional courses in other languages of India in the third and fourth years of study. In addition to these required courses, however, students would choose among several third- and fourth-year elective courses on topics not directly related to India, such as the history and culture of China, Japan or Indonesia.\nSection::::Course numbering system.\nIn the United States, most universities implement a course numbering system where each course is identified by the name of the major (or an abbreviation thereof) followed by a 3- or 4-digit number \u2212 for example, CS 123. This common numbering system was designed to make transfer between colleges easier. In theory, any numbered course in one academic institution should bring a student to the same standard as a similarly numbered course at other institutions.\nThe first digit of the course number is related to its level, or relative difficulty, of the course, and can roughly correspond the year of study in which the course is likely to be taken. It is common for the second digit to represent the subfield in the department within which the course is offered \u2212 for example, in a Physics department, all courses numbered PHYS 47xx may be about magnetism, while all PHYS 48xx courses may be about optics. The attribution of the third and fourth digits is less standardized, but in general, sequences of related courses tend to have consecutive course numbers, with gaps between such sequences to signal different sets of courses.\nThe course number 101 is often used for an introductory course at a beginner's level in a department's subject area."], "wikipedia-479983": ["Section::::Primary and secondary education.:The Netherlands.\nThe Dutch system is based on directives coming from the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW). Primary and secondary education use key objectives to create curricula. For primary education the total number of objectives has been reduced from 122 in 1993 to 58 in 2006. Starting in 2009 and 2010 all key objectives are obligatory for primary education. The key objectives are oriented towards subject areas such as language, mathematics, orientation towards self and the world, art, and physical education. All of the objectives have accompanying concrete activities. Also final exams are determined by the OCW and required. Parts of those exams are taken in a national setting, created by the Centrale Examencommissie Vaststelling Opgaven (CEVO). Furthermore, the OCW will determine the number of hours to be spent per subject. Apart from these directives every school can determine its own curriculum.\nSection::::Primary and secondary education.:Nigeria.\nIn 2005, the Nigerian government adopted a national Basic Education Curriculum for grades 1 through 9. The policy was an outgrowth of the Universal Basic Education program announced in 1999, to provide free, compulsory, continuous public education for these years. In 2014, the government implemented a revised version of the national curriculum, reducing the number of subjects covered from 20 to 10.\nSection::::Primary and secondary education.:Scotland.\nIn Scotland, the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) was introduced in August 2010 in all schools. The national qualifications were introduced in 2013 by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). The national qualifications include the Life Skills Coursework (SFL), National 3 (NAT3), National 4 (NAT4), National 5 (NAT5), Higher, and Advanced Higher.\nSection::::Primary and secondary education.:United Kingdom.\nThe National Curriculum was introduced into England, Wales and Northern Ireland as a nationwide curriculum for primary and secondary state schools following the Education Reform Act 1988. Notwithstanding its name, it does not apply to independent schools, which may set their own curricula, but it ensures that state schools of all local education authorities have a common curriculum. Academies, while publicly funded, have a significant degree of autonomy in deviating from the National Curriculum.\nThe purpose of the National Curriculum was to standardize the content taught across schools to enable assessment, which in turn enabled the compilation of league tables detailing the assessment statistics for each school. These league tables, together with the provision to parents of some degree of choice in assignment of the school for their child (also legislated in the same act) were intended to encourage a 'free market' by allowing parents to choose schools based on their measured ability to teach the National Curriculum.\nSection::::Primary and secondary education.:United States.\nIn the U.S., each state, with the individual school districts, establishes the curricula taught. Each state, however, builds its curriculum with great participation of national academic subject groups selected by the United States Department of Education such as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) for mathematical instruction.\nThe Common Core State Standards Initiative (CCSSI) promulgates a core set of standards which are specific information and skills a student needs to know at each grade level in order to graduate. States may adopt these standards in part or whole and expand upon them. Schools and states (depending on how much control a state gives to its local schools) then develop their curriculum to meet each of these standards. This coordination is intended to make it possible to use more of the same textbooks across states, and to move toward a more uniform minimum level of education attainment.\nAccording to the CCSSI, \u201c[d]ecisions on how to implement the standards, including the right supports to put in place, are made at the state and local levels. As such, states and localities are taking different approaches to implementing the standards and providing their teachers with the supports they need to help students successfully reach the standards.\u201d\nSection::::Higher education.\nMany educational institutions are currently trying to balance two opposing forces. On the one hand, some believe students should have a common knowledge foundation, often in the form of a core curriculum whereas others want students to be able to pursue their own educational interests, often through early specialty in a major or through the free choice of courses. This tension has received a large amount of coverage due to Harvard University's reorganization of its core requirements.\nAn essential feature of curriculum design, seen in every college catalog and at every other level of schooling, is the identification of prerequisites for each course. These prerequisites can be satisfied by taking particular courses, and in some cases by examination, or by other means, such as work experience. In general, more advanced courses in any subject require some foundation in basic courses, but some coursework requires study in other departments, as in the sequence of math classes required for a physics major, or the language requirements for students preparing in literature, music, or scientific research. A more detailed curriculum design must deal with prerequisites within a course for each topic taken up. This in turn leads to the problems of course organization and scheduling once the dependencies between topics are known.\nSection::::Higher education.:Russia.\nCore curriculum has typically been highly emphasized in Soviet and Russian universities and technical institutes.\nSection::::Higher education.:United States.\nSection::::Higher education.:United States.:Core curriculum.\nAt the undergraduate level, individual college and university administrations and faculties sometimes mandate core curricula, especially in the liberal arts. But because of increasing specialization and depth in the student's major field of study, a typical core curriculum in higher education mandates a far smaller proportion of a student's course work than a high school or elementary school core curriculum prescribes.\nAmong the best known and most expansive core curricula programs at leading American colleges and universities are those of Columbia University and the University of Chicago. Both can take up to two years to complete without advanced standing, and are designed to foster critical skills in a broad range of academic disciplines, including: the social sciences, humanities, physical and biological sciences, mathematics, writing and foreign languages.\nIn 1999, the University of Chicago announced plans to reduce and modify the content of its core curriculum, including lowering the number of required courses from 21 to 15 and offering a wider range of content. When \"The New York Times\", \"The Economist\", and other major news outlets picked up this story, the University became the focal point of a national debate on education. The National Association of Scholars released a statement saying, \"[i]t is truly depressing to observe a steady abandonment of the University of Chicago's once imposing undergraduate core curriculum, which for so long stood as the benchmark of content and rigor among American academic institutions.\" Simultaneously, however, a set of university administrators, notably then-President Hugo Sonnenschein, argued that reducing the core curriculum had become both a financial and educational imperative, as the university was struggling to attract a commensurate volume of applicants to its undergraduate division compared to peer schools as a result of what was perceived by the pro-change camp as a reaction by \u201cthe average eighteen-year-old\u201d to the expanse of the collegiate core.\nAs core curricula began to diminish over the course of the twentieth century at many American schools, some smaller institutions became famous for embracing a core curriculum that covers nearly the student\u2019s entire undergraduate education, often utilizing classic texts of the western canon to teach all subjects including science. Five Great Books colleges in the United States follow this approach: St. John\u2019s, Shimer, Thomas Aquinas, Gutenberg College and Thomas More.\nSection::::Higher education.:United States.:Distribution requirements.\nSome colleges opt for the middle ground of the continuum between specified and unspecified curricula by using a system of distribution requirements. In such a system, students are required to take courses in particular fields of learning, but are free to choose specific courses within those fields.\nSection::::Higher education.:United States.:Open curriculum.\nOther institutions have largely done away with core requirements in their entirety. Brown University offers the \"Open Curriculum,\" implemented after a student-led reform movement in 1969, which allows students to take courses without concern for any requirements except those in their chosen concentrations (majors), plus two writing courses. In this vein it is certainly possible for students to graduate without taking college-level science or math courses, or to take only science or math courses. Amherst College requires that students take one of a list of first-year seminars, but has no required classes or distribution requirements. Similarly, Grinnell College requires students to take a First-Year Tutorial in their first semester, and has no other class or distribution requirements. Others include Evergreen State College, Hamilton College, and Smith College.\nWesleyan University is another school that has not and does not require any set distribution of courses. However, Wesleyan does make clear \"General Education Expectations\" such that if a student does not meet these expectations, he/she would not be eligible for academic honors upon graduation."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Coursework in this field generally focuses on teaching, public service, and scholarship. Often at the master's level, curriculum and instruction majors (or curriculum and teaching at some schools) participate in educational research. This major is designed often for preparation to enter educational careers in schools, including classroom teaching.\nSection::::Categories of study.:Counselor education.\nThis is typically the area where students study to become mental health professionals and work toward state licensure in mental health counseling. Typically state licensure requires 90 credit hours on a quarter system.\nSection::::Categories of study.:School counseling.\nCandidates in school counseling typically study psychology, sociology, or social work as undergraduates. The master's degree, in addition to advanced courses of study, certifies an individual for employment as a school counselor.\nSection::::Categories of study.:Neuroscience interdisciplinary degree in education.\nHarvard University is notable for having an interdisciplinary neuroscience master's degree given as an M.Ed. The degree may have little instruction in teaching, with education referring to the learning process in humans versus the profession or institution of education.\nSection::::Categories of study.:Academic enrichment.\nThis is typically the area where teachers are increasing their knowledge in their specific field or branching to another area within teaching. Examples are subject related, such as mathematics, social studies, or science, or tiers of school, such as elementary or high school. These teachers may be maintaining their certification or moving into a more marketable bracket.\nSection::::Categories of study.:Higher education and student affairs.\nCoursework in this area is aimed at the study of colleges and universities (higher education) or the administrative operations of higher education (student affairs) in specific programmatic elements.\nSection::::Categories of study.:Adult education.\nThis focuses on the teaching of individuals 18 years or older. Some classes, such as adult literacy, high school diploma programs, English as a second language, parent education, and some job training classes, are sponsored by the government. Others, such as art and dance classes are fee-based. A B.Ed. degree or teacher's certificate is not usually a requirement for admission to an adult education program.\nSection::::Categories of study.:Special education.\nThis degree designed to develop the capabilities and resources of educators of children who require special education (for example, students with autism spectrum disorders, students with intellectual disabilities).\nSection::::Categories of study.:Religious education.\nA terminal degree in preparation for teaching religious studies.\nSection::::Categories of study.:Media & technology.\nThe purpose of the Master of Education (M.Ed.) in media & technology is to address the learner in the classroom and requires integration of instructional design principles into multimedia presentations with an emphasis in assessment. As classroom instructors across a range of academic disciplines integrate technology into their classrooms, there is an expanding need to have pedagogy and skills that drive this integration. Some will use this degree to design instructional technologies, and others will serve as technology facilitators in schools.\nSection::::Categories of study.:Prep for Ed.D. or Ph.D..\nThis is typically the area where teachers study for continuing work into the doctoral programs. Candidates in this area would study specific educational issues and often begin educational research in preparation for doctoral work. This is the broadest area of master's work for education."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

We define the procrastination score for each submission \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 as \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50) / |\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50| (1) where \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 is the timestamp of the submission, |\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50| is the total number of submissions to the same assignment, and \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50) = |\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 \u2264 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50; \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc61 \u2208 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50| is the rank order in terms of the submission time. Ties between submission times are assigned their average rank. By this definition, the later the submission, the more the student procrastinates on this assignment, and the higher this score. We also illustrate in Figure 1 how this assignment-level procrastination score varies for three arbitrary students in a course with 30 assignments. Compared to, for instance, the absolute time difference between the submission and deadline, this approach is highly scalable for two reasons. First, it does not rely on information about due dates, which instructors across thousands of courses may implement in inconsistent ways. Second, a percentile rank is normalized for assignments and courses, which makes it easy to aggregate and compare them across assignments, courses, and students."], "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/31": ["The way we operationalize procrastination differs from prior work in that it solely relies on task submission times without having to know detailed information about the tasks per se, but the findings are consistent with previous studies that measured procrastination based on more task-specific information (e.g., difference between assignment deadline and submission time) [15, 21, 26, 33]. Given the multifaceted nature of procrastination established in psychological research [37], we acknowledge that any single behavioral measure can only capture certain aspects of procrastination, and that our approach might be a more scalable and convenient, but not necessarily more accurate, measure of procrastination. Our measure also focuses on assignment submission in line with the conceptualization of procrastination as the delay of task completion [22], but we are aware that other aspects of assignment-related activities, such as the time of first access and the frequency of attempts, can also be leveraged to measure procrastination which might lead to different results."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-29527490": 1, "wikipedia-731658": 1, "wikipedia-29992969": 1, "wikipedia-149973": 1, "wikipedia-43070184": 1, "wikipedia-32539277": 1, "wikipedia-5855043": 1, "wikipedia-5005222": 1, "wikipedia-14451712": 1, "wikipedia-36281866": 1, "arxiv-1809.03006": 1, "arxiv-1909.09682": 1, "arxiv-1507.02342": 1, "arxiv-0901.1073": 1, "arxiv-2107.05343": 1, "arxiv-2409.08489": 1, "arxiv-2011.02901": 1, "arxiv-2401.00681": 1, "arxiv-1004.3277": 1, "arxiv-2204.09165": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/13": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/31": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/34": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/18": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-29527490": 1, "wikipedia-731658": 1, "wikipedia-29992969": 1, "wikipedia-149973": 1, "wikipedia-43070184": 1, "wikipedia-32539277": 1, "wikipedia-5855043": 1, "wikipedia-5005222": 1, "wikipedia-14451712": 1, "wikipedia-36281866": 1, "arxiv-1809.03006": 1, "arxiv-1909.09682": 1, "arxiv-1507.02342": 1, "arxiv-0901.1073": 1, "arxiv-2107.05343": 1, "arxiv-2409.08489": 1, "arxiv-2011.02901": 1, "arxiv-2401.00681": 1, "arxiv-1004.3277": 1, "arxiv-2204.09165": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/13": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/31": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/34": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/7": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/18": 1}}}

Most workers want to know how they are doing on the job. Workers need performance feedback to work effectively. Accessing an employee timely, accurate, constructive feedback is key to effective performance. Motivational strategies such as goal setting depend upon regular performance updates. While there are many sources of error with performance ratings, error can be reduced through rater training and through the use of behaviorally anchored rating scales. In industrial and organizational psychology such scales are used to clearly define the behaviors that constitute poor, average, and superior performance.\nThere are several methods of performance rating. The simplest and most common method is based on speed or pace. Dexterity and effectiveness are also important considerations when assessing performance. Standard performance is denoted as 100. A performance rating greater than 100 means the worker's performance is more than standard, and less than 100 means the worker's performance is less than standard. It is important to note that standard performance is not necessarily the performance level expected of workers, the term standard can be misleading. For example, a standard performance rating of a worker walking is 4.5 miles/hour. The ratings is used in conjunction with a timing study to level out actual time (observed time) taken by the worker under observation. This leads to a basic minute value (observed time/100*rating). This balances out fast and slow workers to get to a standard/average time. Standard at a 100 is not a percentage, it simply makes the calculations easier.

We visually inspect group differences by graphing the distribution of the procrastination score in Figure 2. We find that procrastination scores are normally distributed and centered around 0.5, but the distribution is shifted up for male students, first-generation college students, and especially URM students. This suggests that these groups of students exhibit more procrastination behavior on average compared to their peers.\nTo understand the magnitude of these differences, we plot the mean procrastination score for each subgroup on the same scale in Figure 3. A mean procrastination score of 0.5 indicates that, on average, students in this group tend to submit their assignments neither early nor late relative to others; for instance, in a class of 40 students, they tend to be the 20th person to submit. We find that this is the case for female students, continuing-generation college students, and non-URM students, but not their counterparts. For instance, the mean procrastination score among URM students is 5 percentage points higher (\ud835\udc43 = 0.55). Moreover, disaggregating ethnic and racial groups shows substantial variation in procrastination behavior, with the highest average score among Black students (\ud835\udc43 = 0.59) and the lowest among White students (\ud835\udc43 = 0.49).\nWe identify several identity-based sources of variation in procrastination. To understand their concurrent relationship with procrastination behavior, we fit a multiple regression model predicting the procrastination score with all the student characteristics in Figure 2 except for the URM indicator due to its collinearity with the specific racial and ethnic categories. Table 2 reports the model estimates. The predictors are coded such that the intercept represents the largest subgroup, which also happens to have the lowest mean procrastination score: White female continuing-generation college students. We find that the gaps in average procrastination visualized in Figure 3 are all statistically significant with similar magnitude. Overall, sociodemographic characteristics do not have strong predictive power, accounting for just 3% of variation in procrastination scores, but this is common in complex social systems and does not itself reduce the significance of the finding [20]."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

However, an \"R\" close to 1 does not guarantee that the model fits the data well: as Anscombe's quartet shows, a high \"R\" can occur in the presence of misspecification of the functional form of a relationship or in the presence of outliers that distort the true relationship.\n\nSection::::Analysis of residuals.\nThe residuals from a fitted model are the differences between the responses observed at each combination of values of the explanatory variables and the corresponding prediction of the response computed using the regression function. Mathematically, the definition of the residual for the \"i\" observation in the data set is written\nwith \"y\" denoting the \"i\" response in the data set and \"x\" the vector of explanatory variables, each set at the corresponding values found in the \"i\" observation in the data set.\nIf the model fit to the data were correct, the residuals would approximate the random errors that make the relationship between the explanatory variables and the response variable a statistical relationship. Therefore, if the residuals appear to behave randomly, it suggests that the model fits the data well. On the other hand, if non-random structure is evident in the residuals, it is a clear sign that the model fits the data poorly. The next section details the types of plots to use to test different aspects of a model and gives the correct interpretations of different results that could be observed for each type of plot.\n\nSection::::Out-of-sample evaluation.\nCross-validation is the process of assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. If the model has been estimated over some, but not all, of the available data, then the model using the estimated parameters can be used to predict the held-back data. If, for example, the out-of-sample mean squared error, also known as the mean squared prediction error, is substantially higher than the in-sample mean square error, this is a sign of deficiency in the model."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Researchers have suggested that this occurs due to the closer comparison between the individual and the average peer, however use of this method means that it is impossible to know whether a participant has overestimated themselves, underestimated the average peer, or both.\nThe indirect method of comparison involves participants rating themselves and the average peer on separate scales and the illusory superiority effect is found by taking the average peer score away from the individual's score (with a higher score indicating a greater effect).

They usually don't have the modern fashion sense of other groups, and they usually prefer chess to hoops. \"Geeky\" interests and hobbies usually include: fantasy movies and shows, role-playing games and technical hobbies and activities (which in some cases can include technology knowledge). Geeks are smart, but they sometimes have a hard time socially, as many teens view them as being more boring to be around than others.\nBULLET::::- Jocks \u2013 live for athletics, tend to be popular with many of their peers. They may be the male equivalent of \"mean girls\".\nBULLET::::- Thespians \u2013 the teens who are obsessed with Broadway musicals and more than likely aspire to do theatre professionally. They typically have a very busy and complicated schedule, spending most of their time in rehearsal for the school show or working on their craft. They generally do well academically and have a good sense of responsibility. Their hobbies include learning all the songs and dances to all their favourite musicals, singing randomly at any given time, and obsessing over a new favourite Broadway show every week. They are usually very kind and sweet to those outside of their own clique, except for the occasional diva. They are also creative and very funny, but have a unique sense of humor which is only funny to those who understand musical theatre references; their preferred subjects are in the performing arts\u2014drama, singing, dance, acting, and musical theatre. They may also be involved in other performing arts activities, such as choir or dancing.\nBULLET::::- Skaters \u2013 skateboarders who came along and borrowed the long hair and slacker trappings of the surf scene, but they have always been more rebellious.\nBULLET::::- Outsiders \u2013 may be socially challenged and unable to fit in, or they may be independent and feel no need to join any one group exclusively. They tend to have an \"I don't care about anything\" attitude, and will oftentimes get in trouble for it.\nBULLET::::- Hipsters \u2013 make a big effort to assemble a wardrobe that seems effortless. They challenge traditional norms and modern trends. All genders wear tight jeans, flannel shirts, Buddy Holly glasses and vintage clothing. They follow the latest trends in fashion and like to be independent from the other cliques and often do what is \"uncool\" before it becomes \"cool\".\nBULLET::::- Greasers - A rather uncommon clique but can be spotted in high schools all over the globe. This clique started in the late 40s and was popular up until the mid 60s but there are small cliques you can find who are greasers. Hated by lots of kids and are teased but tease back (Give none take none is a motto by the greasers meaning; don't take crap or create crap). Greasers wear leather jackets, dickies jackets, etc. and jeans cuffed 1-3 inches and grease their hair using pomade or a similar substance. They also can be spotted wearing vintage looking converse and \"buckle boots\" otherwise known as engineer boots.\nBULLET::::- Scenesters \u2013 Also known as Trendies, they are ever eager to fit in. They are dedicated followers of fashion, devoted to a particular band, club or style. They dress in tight, fashionable clothing, wear sunglasses and sport wild but styled hairdos (striped, streaked or spiked). Social media platforms are totally essential to them. Scenesters sometimes get labeled posers or wannabes.\nBULLET::::- Preps \u2013 a subgenre of the popular clique. Preps tend to be good at being social and having fun and usually come from an upper middle class or upper-class family. Sometimes they overlap with jocks, especially when it comes to sports. In most high schools, preps are those most commonly chosen to have important positions for school events such as Class Officers, Extracurricular Activities, Home Coming King/Queen, Prom King/Queen and Prom Court. Maintaining the right image may even make them vulnerable. Unlike the stereotype of \"mean girls\", preps often get along with everyone.\nBULLET::::- Nerds \u2013 they are obsessed and often have superior knowledge or devotion to something, usually aren't fashion-conscious, may be introverted, and they often do well in school.\nBULLET::::- Mean girls \u2013 the 2004 movie \"Mean Girls\", starring Lindsay Lohan as a girl negotiating the jungles of teenage subcultures, put a new label on this type of teen. They always embrace the latest fashions. They form exclusive cliques and frequently engage in gossip. They crave popularity, often because they feel insecure; yet they have a hard time with genuine relationships.\nBULLET::::- Emo kids \u2013 highly emotional. Their emotions are reflected in their appearance: dark clothing, streaked bangs, and tattoos and piercings. The emo style has its roots in punk culture, which tended to be more rebellious, and goth, which was darker and gloomier. Some emos are described as scene kids because they wear brighter neon clothes. These kids are more vulnerable to depression or bipolar tendencies. They are known for experiments with self-injury and cutting, though not all of them do this. Emo kids tend to be mistaken for goth due to their dark outfits, or sometimes rockers being they often wear band t-shirts and have a lot of musical interests.\nBULLET::::- Rockers \u2013 tend to stay away from the crowd and in small groups with similar interests in music. This is a very large clique because of how diverse it is. They tend to wear band T-shirts, lots of jewelry, and baggy or tight jeans and are usually listening to music. Many of them will be in a band or know an instrument. They live according to the Rock and Roll lifestyle: Sex, drugs, and music.\nBULLET::::- Drifters \u2013 individuals that are capable of simultaneous interactions with one or more groups non-exclusively, or being independent at their own accord. They don't demand attention, often opting to blend in the background to avoid potential conflict or being labeled as part of a group. However, some usually don't mind being in the know with most gossips or rumors or learning things that no one else is aware of. All-Rounders play the neutral role most of the time.

Perceptual stimuli are what the individual picks up from his or her surroundings, such as sensations of pain or pleasure, perception of facial expression (Smith & Kirby 2000). In addition to these stimuli, the process model is composed to two main appraisal processes. Associative processing is a memory-based process that makes quick connections and provides appraisal information based on activated memories that are quickly associated with the given stimulus (Marsella & Gratch 2009). Reasoning is a slower, more deliberate, and thorough process that involves logical, critical thinking about the stimulus and/or situation (Marsella & Gratch 2009). In the two-process model of appraisal theory, associative processing and reasoning work in parallel in reaction to perceptual stimuli, thus providing a more complex and cognitively based appraisal of the emotional encounter (Smith & Kirby 2000)."], "wikipedia-14662436": ["Part-based models refers to a broad class of detection algorithms used on images, in which various parts of the image are used separately in order to determine if and where an object of interest exists. Amongst these methods a very popular one is the constellation model which refers to those schemes which seek to detect a small number of features and their relative positions to then determine whether or not the object of interest is present.\nThese models build on the original idea of Fischler and Elschlager of using the relative position of a few template matches and evolve in complexity in the work of Perona and others. These models will be covered in the constellation models section. To get a better idea of what is meant by constellation model an example may be more illustrative. Say we are trying to detect faces. A constellation model would use smaller part detectors, for instance mouth, nose and eye detectors and make a judgment about whether an image has a face based on the relative positions in which the components fire.\n\nNon-constellation models.\n Many overlapping ideas are included under the title part-based models even after having excluded those models of the constellation variety. The uniting thread is the use of small parts to build up to an algorithm that can detect/recognize an item (face, car, etc.)\nLater efforts such as those by Poggio and Brunelli focus on building specific detectors for each feature. They use successive detectors to estimate scale, position, etc. and narrow the search field to be used by the next detector. As such it is a part-based model, however, they seek more to recognize specific faces rather than to detect the presence of a face. They do so by using each detector to build a 35 element vector of characteristics of a given face. These characteristic can then be compared to recognize specific faces, however cut-offs can also be used to detect whether a face is present at all.\nCootes, Lanitis and Taylor build on this work in constructing a 100 element representation of the primary features of a face. The model is more detailed and robust however, given the additional complexity (100 elements compared to 35) this might be expected. The model essentially computes deviations from a mean face in terms of shape, orientation and gray level. The model is matched by the minimization of an error function. These three classes of algorithms naturally fall within the scope of template matching\nOf the non-constellation perhaps the most successful is that of Leibe and Schiele. Their algorithm finds templates associated with positive examples and records both the template (an average of the feature in all positive examples where it is present) and the position of the center of the item (a face for instance) relative to the template. The algorithm then takes a test image and runs an interest point locater (hopefully one of the scale invariant variety). These interest points are then compared to each template and the probability of a match is computed. All templates then cast votes for the center of the detected object proportional to the probability of the match, and the probability the template predicts the center. These votes are all summed and if there are enough of them, well enough clustered, the presence of the object in question (i.e. a face or car) is predicted.\nThe algorithm is effective because it imposes much less constellational rigidity the way the constellation model does. Admittedly the constellation model can be modified to allow for occlusions and other large abnormalities but this model is naturally suited to it. Also it must be said that sometimes the more rigid structure of the constellation is desired."], "wikipedia-22016953": ["The J1\u2013J2 model is a quantum spin model like the Heisenberg model but also includes a term for the interaction between next-nearest neighbor spins.\nIn this model, the term formula_1 represents the usual nearest-neighbor interaction as seen in the Heisenberg model, and formula_2 represents the exchange interaction to the next nearest-neighbor."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

It works by breaking the word down and states that when a word is heard all words that begin with the first sound of the target word are activated. This set of words is considered the cohort. Once the first cohort has been activated, the other information, or sounds in the word narrow down the choices. The person recognizes the word when you are left with a single choice; this is considered the \"recognition point\".\nBULLET::::- checking modelThis model was developed by Norris in 1986. In this particular model, he took the approach that any word that partially matches the input is analyzed and checked to see if it fits with the context of the situation.\nBULLET::::- interactive-activation modelThis model is considered a connectionist model. Proposed by McClelland and Rumelhart in the 1981 to 1982 period, it is based around nodes, which are visual features, and positions of letters within a given word. They also act as word detectors which have inhibitory and excitatory connections between them. This model starts with first letter and suggests that all the words with that first letter are activated at first and then going through the word one can determine what the word is they are looking at. The main principle is that mental phenomena can be described by interconnected networks of simple units.\nBULLET::::- verification modelThe model was developed by Curtis Becker in 1970. The main idea is that a small number of candidates that are activated in parallel are subject to a serial-verification process. This model starts the word-recognition process with a basic representation of the stimulus. Then, sensory trace, consisting of line features is used to activate word detectors. When an acceptable number of detectors are activated these are used to generate a search set. These items are drawn from the lexicon on the basis of similarity to the sensory trace, which help with the identity of the stimulus.

This is obtained through numerical maximization via expectation\u2013maximization of a \"fit criterion\" as provided by maximum likelihood estimation, quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, weighted least squares or asymptotically distribution-free methods. This is often accomplished by using a specialized SEM analysis program, of which several exist.\nSection::::General approach to SEM.:Assessment of model and model fit.\nHaving estimated a model, analysts will want to interpret the model. Estimated paths may be tabulated and/or presented graphically as a path model. The impact of variables is assessed using path tracing rules (see path analysis).\nIt is important to examine the \"fit\" of an estimated model to determine how well it models the data. This is a basic task in SEM modeling: forming the basis for accepting or rejecting models and, more usually, accepting one competing model over another. The output of SEM programs includes matrices of the estimated relationships between variables in the model. Assessment of fit essentially calculates how similar the predicted data are to matrices containing the relationships in the actual data.\nFormal statistical tests and fit indices have been developed for these purposes. Individual parameters of the model can also be examined within the estimated model in order to see how well the proposed model fits the driving theory. Most, though not all, estimation methods make such tests of the model possible.\nOf course as in all statistical hypothesis tests, SEM model tests are based on the assumption that the correct and complete relevant data have been modeled. In the SEM literature, discussion of fit has led to a variety of different recommendations on the precise application of the various fit indices and hypothesis tests.\nThere are differing approaches to assessing fit. Traditional approaches to modeling start from a null hypothesis, rewarding more parsimonious models (i.e. those with fewer free parameters), to others such as AIC that focus on how little the fitted values deviate from a saturated model (i.e. how well they reproduce the measured values), taking into account the number of free parameters used. Because different measures of fit capture different elements of the fit of the model, it is appropriate to report a selection of different fit measures. Guidelines (i.e., \"cutoff scores\") for interpreting fit measures, including the ones listed below, are the subject of much debate among SEM researchers.\nSome of the more commonly used measures of fit include:\nBULLET::::- Chi-squared\nBULLET::::- A fundamental measure of fit used in the calculation of many other fit measures. Conceptually it is a function of the sample size and the difference between the observed covariance matrix and the model covariance matrix.\nBULLET::::- Akaike information criterion (AIC)\nBULLET::::- A test of relative model fit: The preferred model is the one with the lowest AIC value.\nBULLET::::- formula_1\nBULLET::::- where \"k\" is the number of parameters in the statistical model, and \"L\" is the maximized value of the likelihood of the model.\nBULLET::::- Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)\nBULLET::::- Fit index where a value of zero indicates the best fit. While the guideline for determining a \"close fit\" using RMSEA is highly contested, most researchers concur that an RMSEA of .1 or more indicates poor fit.\nBULLET::::- Standardized Root Mean Residual (SRMR)\nBULLET::::- The SRMR is a popular absolute fit indicator. Hu and Bentler (1999) suggested .08 or smaller as a guideline for good fit. Kline (2011) suggested .1 or smaller as a guideline for good fit.\nBULLET::::- Comparative Fit Index (CFI)\nBULLET::::- In examining baseline comparisons, the CFI depends in large part on the average size of the correlations in the data. If the average correlation between variables is not high, then the CFI will not be very high. A CFI value of .95 or higher is desirable.\nFor each measure of fit, a decision as to what represents a good-enough fit between the model and the data must reflect other contextual factors such as sample size, the ratio of indicators to factors, and the overall complexity of the model. For example, very large samples make the Chi-squared test overly sensitive and more likely to indicate a lack of model-data fit. )\nSection::::General approach to SEM.:Model modification.\nThe model may need to be modified in order to improve the fit, thereby estimating the most likely relationships between variables. Many programs provide modification indices which may guide minor modifications. Modification indices report the change in \u03c7\u00b2 that result from freeing fixed parameters: usually, therefore adding a path to a model which is currently set to zero. Modifications that improve model fit may be flagged as potential changes that can be made to the model. Modifications to a model, especially the structural model, are changes to the theory claimed to be true. Modifications therefore must make sense in terms of the theory being tested, or be acknowledged as limitations of that theory. Changes to measurement model are effectively claims that the items/data are impure indicators of the latent variables specified by theory.\nModels should not be led by MI, as Maccallum (1986) demonstrated: \"even under favorable conditions, models arising from specification searches must be viewed with caution.\"\nSection::::General approach to SEM.:Sample size and power.\nWhile researchers agree that large sample sizes are required to provide sufficient statistical power and precise estimates using SEM, there is no general consensus on the appropriate method for determining adequate sample size. Generally, the considerations for determining sample size include the number of observations per parameter, the number of observations required for fit indexes to perform adequately, and the number of observations per degree of freedom. Researchers have proposed guidelines based on simulation studies, professional experience, and mathematical formulas.\nSample size requirements to achieve a particular significance and power in SEM hypothesis testing are similar for the same model when any of the three algorithms (PLS-PA, LISREL or systems of regression equations) are used for testing.\nSection::::General approach to SEM.:Interpretation and communication.\nThe set of models are then interpreted so that claims about the constructs can be made, based on the best fitting model.\nCaution should always be taken when making claims of causality even when experimentation or time-ordered studies have been done. The term \"causal model\" must be understood to mean \"a model that conveys causal assumptions\", not necessarily a model that produces validated causal conclusions. Collecting data at multiple time points and using an experimental or quasi-experimental design can help rule out certain rival hypotheses but even a randomized experiment cannot rule out all such threats to causal inference. Good fit by a model consistent with one causal hypothesis invariably entails equally good fit by another model consistent with an opposing causal hypothesis. No research design, no matter how clever, can help distinguish such rival hypotheses, save for interventional experiments.\nAs in any science, subsequent replication and perhaps modification will proceed from the initial finding."], "wikipedia-44411716": ["The PLS structural equation model is composed of two sub-models: the measurement model and structural model.

This encourages future research on how specific course and task characteristics affect this relationship, especially in small classes where this relationship varies the most and instructors have more flexibility in instructional design and policies. Such insights can inform dynamic interventions to counteract undesirable procrastination behavior. Second, using the same modeling approach, researchers can study within-individual variation (or stability) in procrastination behavior over time and across concurrent courses. Students sometimes procrastinate due to busy course schedules, new learning environments (e.g., first year of college), or other contextual factors. Students may also develop self-regulated learning skills throughout their college experience that reduce the chance of procrastination. In any case, tracking procrastination behavior at the individual level may shed light on students\u2019 educational contexts and development of study habits and help improve institutional policies to better support student success. Finally, this study exemplifies equity-oriented learning analytics research, which is a growing area of research [30, 41]. Future contributions to this research area can examine other aspects of learning behavior across demographic groups of students and in the broader context of social injustice. An understanding of how behavioral inequalities arise and contribute to gaps in educational access, experiences and outcomes can inform ways to improve justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in education."], "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/4": ["This study contributes to the literature on procrastination in several ways. First, we propose a procrastination index based on students\u2019 behavioral traces in learning management systems (LMS) relative to their classmates, without having to know the details of individual tasks and courses. Given the widespread deployment of LMS at higher education institutions [19], this index can be applied to a variety of institutional and instructional contexts to depict students\u2019 time management. Second, we unveil sociodemographic inequalities in academic procrastination and connect them to inequality in educational outcomes in one of the largest and most granular datasets on this topic. We position issues of educational inequalities in the procrastination literature to model and stimulate more computational behavioral science research on social inequalities in education. Insights from this study can inform the development of more equitable learning analytics interventions to support self-regulation and mitigate negative consequences of procrastination."], "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": ["Our study revisits the prevalent phenomenon of academic procrastination and reaffirms on an unprecedented scale the established negative relationship between procrastination and performance [22]. More importantly, we incorporate an equity lens and extend some earlier, survey-based findings about demographic differences in procrastination and more broadly, self-regulation [5, 42]. The systematic sociodemographic gaps in the prevalence of procrastination that we identify echo existing disparities in the educational experiences across sociodemographic groups and highlight this phenomenon in broader social contexts. Social injustice, prejudice, and stereotypes based on students\u2019 different visible and invisible social identities further affect their levels of confidence, self-efficacy, academic engagement, and social interaction during their college experience. In this context, procrastination is a symptom of systemic issues in education, rather than an individual failure or a root cause of academic underperformance as early research tends to assume. On the other hand, the link between inequality in in-class procrastination and end-of-course performance gaps highlights procrastination as a behavioral antecedent of educational inequality. This micro-level behavioral factor, susceptible to structural external forces and grounded in research on meta-cognition [37], can add granular insights about the development of macro-level achievement gaps through the depiction of associated psychological processes. Practically, the behavioral nature also suggests that procrastination is a malleable factor on which educators can intervene to mitigate the negative consequences on student success and educational equity. While in our results procrastination only explains a small portion of achievement gaps, it is still desirable to reduce procrastination behavior as it shows a consistent negative relationship with performance across different sociodemographic groups."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-31558152": 1, "wikipedia-2007748": 1, "wikipedia-52839405": 1, "wikipedia-12634266": 1, "wikipedia-306543": 1, "wikipedia-31970118": 1, "wikipedia-5799154": 1, "wikipedia-60330183": 1, "wikipedia-644504": 1, "wikipedia-17982039": 1, "arxiv-1612.05994": 1, "arxiv-2409.05630": 1, "arxiv-1103.0612": 1, "arxiv-2412.19242": 1, "arxiv-2503.20072": 1, "arxiv-2412.04614": 1, "arxiv-1705.01568": 1, "arxiv-1206.5289": 1, "arxiv-2210.00239": 1, "arxiv-2005.13179": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/20": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/19": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/29": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/32": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/2": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-31558152": 1, "wikipedia-2007748": 1, "wikipedia-52839405": 1, "wikipedia-12634266": 1, "wikipedia-306543": 1, "wikipedia-31970118": 1, "wikipedia-5799154": 1, "wikipedia-60330183": 1, "wikipedia-644504": 1, "wikipedia-17982039": 1, "arxiv-1612.05994": 1, "arxiv-2409.05630": 1, "arxiv-1103.0612": 1, "arxiv-2412.19242": 1, "arxiv-2503.20072": 1, "arxiv-2412.04614": 1, "arxiv-1705.01568": 1, "arxiv-1206.5289": 1, "arxiv-2210.00239": 1, "arxiv-2005.13179": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/20": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/19": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/29": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/32": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/4": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/2": 1}}}

As a result, these children enter school with decreased word knowledge that can affect their language skills, influence their experience with books, and create different perceptions and expectations in the classroom context.\nStudies show that when students have parental assistance with homework, they perform better in school. This is a problem for many minority students due to the large number of single-parent households (67% of African-American children are in a single-parent household) and the increase in non-English speaking parents. Students from single-parent homes often find it difficult to find time to receive help from their parent. Similarly, some Hispanic students have difficulty getting help with their homework because there is not an English speaker at home to offer assistance.\nDisadvantages in a child's early life can cultivate into achievement gaps in their education. Poverty, coupled with the environment they are raised in, can lead to shortcomings in educational achievement. Despite strong standards and beliefs in education, Hispanic children consistently perform poorly, reflected by a low average of math and reading scores, as compared to other groups except African American. Hispanic and African American children have been shown to be more likely to be raised in poverty, with 33% of Hispanic families living below the economic poverty level, compared to African American (39%), Asian (14%) and White (13%) counterparts. Children who are raised in poverty are less likely to be enrolled in nursery or preschool. Though researchers are seeing improvements in achievement levels, such as a decrease in high school dropout rates (from 24% to 17%) and a steady increase in math and reading scores over the past 10 years, there are still issues that must be addressed.\nDifferent schools have different effects on similar students. Children of color tend to be concentrated in low-achieving, highly segregated schools. In general, minority students are more likely to come from low-income households, meaning minority students are more likely to attend poorly funded schools based on the districting patterns within the school system. Schools in lower-income districts tend to employ less qualified teachers and have fewer educational resources. Research shows that teacher effectiveness is the most important in-school factor affecting student learning. Good teachers can actually close or eliminate the gaps in achievement on the standardized tests that separate white and minority students.\nSchools also tend to place students in tracking groups as a means of tailoring lesson plans for different types of learners. However, as a result of schools placing emphasis on socioeconomic status and cultural capital, minority students are vastly over-represented in lower educational tracks. Similarly, Hispanic and African American students are often wrongly placed into lower tracks based on teachers\u2019 and administrators\u2019 expectations for minority students. Such expectations of a race within school systems are a form of institutional racism. Some researchers compare the tracking system to a modern form of racial segregation within the schools.\nStudies on tracking groups within schools have also proven to be detrimental for minority students. Once students are in these lower tracks, they tend to have less-qualified teachers, a less challenging curriculum, and few opportunities to advance into higher tracks. There is also some research that suggests students in lower tracks suffer from social psychological consequences of being labeled as a slower learner, which often leads children to stop trying in school.\nAdditionally, poor and minority students have disproportionately less access to high-quality early childhood education, which has been shown to have a strong impact on early learning and development. One study found that although black children are more likely to attend preschool than white children, they may experience lower-quality care. The same study also found that Hispanic children in the U.S. are much less likely to attend preschool than white children. Another study conducted in Illinois in 2010 found that only one in three Latino parents could find a preschool slot for his or her child, compared to almost two thirds of other families."], "wikipedia-33541929": ["The Hispanic White Gap demonstrates:\nBULLET::::- In mathematics, a 21-point difference at the 4th grade level and a 26-point difference at the 8th grade level.\nBULLET::::- In reading, there is a 25-point difference at the 4th grade level and a 24-point difference at the 8th grade level (NAEP, 2011).\n\nData from the October 2001 Current Population Survey (CPS) show that black and Hispanic students were more likely to have dropped out of high school between October 2000 and October 2001 than were white or Asians/Pacific Islander students. During this period, 6.3% of black and 8.8% of Hispanic high school students dropped out compared to 4.1% of white and 2.3% of Asian/Pacific Islander high school students.\n\nIn October 2001, about 3.8 million 16- through 24-year-olds were not enrolled in a high school program and had not completed high school. These individuals accounted for 10.7% of the 35.2 million 16- through 24-year-olds in the United States in 2001. In 1972, the white status dropout rate was 40% and the black status dropout rate was 49%. Because the black rate declined more steeply than the white rate, there has been a narrowing of the gap between the dropout rates for blacks and whites. However, this narrowing occurred in the 1980s, and the gap between whites and blacks has remained fairly constant since 1990. The percentage of Hispanics who were status dropouts has remained higher than that of blacks and whites in every year since 1970. Even though Hispanics represented approximately the same percentage of the young adult population as did blacks, Hispanics were disproportionately represented among status dropouts in 2001. Also in 2001, the status dropout rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders ages 16\u201324 was lower than for any other 16- through 24-year-olds. Specifically, the status rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders was 3.6%, compared with 27.0% for Hispanics, 20.9% for blacks, and 7.3% for whites.\n\nRacial and ethnic variations in SAT scores follow a similar pattern to other racial achievement gaps. In 1990, the average SAT was 528 for Asian-Americans, 491 for whites, 429 for Mexican Americans and 385 for blacks. 34% of Asians compared with 20% of whites, 3% of blacks, 7% of Mexican Americans, and 9% of Native Americans scored above a 600 on the SAT math section. On the SAT verbal section in 1990, whites scored an average of 442, compared with 410 for Asians, 352 for blacks, 380 for Mexican Americans, and 388 for Native Americans.\nIn 2015, the average SAT scores on the math section were 598 for Asian-Americans, 534 for whites, 457 for Hispanic Latinos and 428 for blacks.", "Overall, the White-Hispanic and the White-Black gap for NAEP scores have significantly decreased since the 1970s.\nThe Black-White Gap demonstrates:\nBULLET::::- In mathematics, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 14 points from 1973 to 2008.\nBULLET::::- In reading, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 24 points from 1971 to 2008.\nThe Hispanic-White Gap demonstrates:\nBULLET::::- In mathematics, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 12 points from 1973 to 2008.\nBULLET::::- In reading, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 15 points from 1975 to 2008.\nFurthermore, subgroups showed predominant gains in 4th grade at all achievement levels. In terms of achieving proficiency, gaps between subgroups in most states have narrowed across grade levels, yet had widened in 23% of instances. The progress made in elementary and middle schools was greater than that in high schools, which demonstrates the importance of early childhood education. Greater gains were seen in lower-performing subgroups rather than in higher-performing subgroups. Similarly, greater gains were seen in Latino and African American subgroups than for low-income and Native American subgroups."], "wikipedia-2449242": ["The achievement gap refers to the academic disparity between certain groups, including African-Americans, Latinos, students whose first language is not English, and students living in poverty, that perform significantly below others. This gap extends beyond the results of standardized test scores and also applies to the disparity between certain groups regarding dropout rates, participation in honors classes and Advanced Placement (AP) exams, and numbers of students admitted to colleges. Due to Berkeley High School's racially, ethnically and socio-economically diverse student population, it has been called the \"most integrated high school in America.\" However an achievement gap continues to exist between the white students and black and Latino students. For example, for the 2017-18 school year, the percentages of white students who graduated with the requirements for the UC application fulfilled was 86%, compared to 40% of black students and 50% of Latino students. In 2015, the graduation rate for English learners was 68%--much lower than any other group.

While this article focuses on the achievement gap in the United States, the gap in achievement between lower income students and higher income students exists in all nations and it has been studied extensively in the U.S. and other countries, including the U.K. Various other gaps between groups exist around the globe as well.\n\nThe education of African Americans and some other minorities lags behind those of other U.S. ethnic groups, such as Whites and Asian Americans, as reflected by test scores, grades, urban high school graduation rates, rates of disciplinary action, and rates of conferral of undergraduate degrees. Indeed, high school graduation rates and college enrollment rates are comparable to those of whites 25 or 30 years ago. It should also be noted that the category of African immigrant population (excluding Haitians and other foreign-born blacks born outside of Africa) has the highest educational attainment of any group in the United States, but they represent a small group within the larger African American population.\n\nEast Asian Americans of Taiwanese, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean descent score the highest, with thousands of East Asians scoring perfect scores, in all scholastic standardized tests such as the SAT, GRE, MCAT, USMLE exams and IQ tests followed by caucasian White people who score in the intermediate range followed by African-American and Hispanic students who tend to score in the lower ranges.

Black African and Caribbean immigrant groups to the U.S report having higher levels of education than any other group. Of all foreign-born U.S. residents, foreign born Africans (those who come from the African continent) nowadays have a higher level of educational attainment than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States. They tend to be highly educated and be fluent in English. This trend was first reported in the 1990s by the \"Journal of Blacks in Higher Education\", and still continues today.\nAccording to data from the 2000 United States Census, \"43.8 percent of African immigrants had achieved a college degree, compared with 42.5 of Asian Americans, 28.9 percent of immigrants from Europe, Russia and Canada and 23.1 percent of the U.S. population as a whole.\" The educational attainment amount varies by group. According to the U.S. Census, out of the African populations, Nigerians reported to having the highest level of education.\nUS Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans age 25 to 29 had completed high school, lagging only slightly behind 93 percent for whites. For all over the age of 25, clear majorities of whites, Asian Americans and African Americans had graduated at 88 percent, 85 percent and 77 percent, respectively. 56 percent, or barely over half of Hispanics 25 and over, had completed high school.\nConservative African American scholars such as Thomas Sowell observe that while SAT scores are lower for students with less parental education and income. Asian Americans who took the SAT with incomes below $10,000 score 482 in math in 1995, comparable to whites earning $30\u201340,000 and higher and blacks over $70,000. Test scores in middle-income black communities, such as Prince George County, are still not comparable to those in non-black suburbs.\nMost state tests showing African American failure rates anywhere from two to four times the rate of whites, such as Washington State's WASL test, and only half to one-quarter as likely to achieve a high score, even though these tests were designed to eliminate the negative effects of bias associated with standardized multiple choice tests.\nThe amount of education completed varies greatly between members of religions in the United States. Hindus and Jews, for example, are more likely than general population to have completed a college education, whereas members of Evangelical churches, historically Black Protestant churches and Jehovah's Witness are less likely (21%, 15% and 12% respectively).\nAs a whole, students in the United States lagged the best Asian and European nations in the TIMSS international math and science test. However, broken down by race, US Asians scored comparably to Asian nations, white Americans scored comparably to the best European nations. Although some racial generally score lower than whites in the US, they scored as well as whites in other European nations. Hispanic Americans averaged 505, comparable to students Austria and Sweden, while African Americans at 482 were comparable to Norway and Ukraine.\nAchievement gaps among students may also manifest themselves in the racial and ethnic composition of special education and gifted education programs. Typically, African American and Hispanic students are enrolled in greater numbers in special education programs than their numbers would indicate in most populations, while these groups are underrepresented in gifted programs. Research shows that these disproportionate enrollment trends may be a consequence of the differences in educational achievement among groups.\nFor the past fifty years, there has been a gap in the educational achievement of males and females in the United States, but which gender has been disadvantaged has fluctuated over the years. In the 1970s and 1980s, data showed girls trailing behind boys in a variety of academic performance measures, specifically in test scores in math and science.\nData in the last twenty years shows the general trend of girls outperforming boys in academic achievement in terms of class grades across all subjects and college graduation rates, but boys scoring higher on standardized tests and being better represented in the higher-paying and more prestigious STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math). Male students consistently achieved worse school marks than female students from 1913 to 2011 in all countries for which there is data.", "Traditionally, girls have outperformed boys in reading and writing. Although this gap may be minimal in kindergarten, it grows as students continue their education. According to the 2004 National Reading Assessment measured by the US Department of Education, the gap between boys and girls, only slightly noticeable in 4th grade, left boys 14 points behind girls during their 12th grade year. On the 2008 test, female students continued to have higher average reading scores than male students at all three ages. The gap between male and female 4th graders was 7 points in 2008. By 12th grade, there was an 11-point gap between males and females.\nOn the 2002 National Writing Assessment, boys scored on average 17 points lower than girls in 4th grade. The average gap increased to 21 points by 8th grade and widened to 24 points by senior year in high school. In the more recent 2007 National Assessment of Writing Skills, female students continued to score higher than male students, though margins closed slightly from previous assessments. The average score for female eighth-graders was 20 points higher than males, down 1 point from the 2002 score. For twelfth-graders, females outscored males by 18 points as opposed to 21 points in 2002.\nAll of these assessments were conducted on a 100-point scale.\nWhich gender is disadvantaged by the gap in math and science achievement largely depends on how academic achievement is being measured. Female students generally have better grades in their math classes, and this gap starts off very minimal but increases with age. However, males score higher on standardized math tests, and these score gaps also increase with age. Male students also score higher on measures of college readiness, such as the AP Calculus exams and the math section of the SAT.\nThe differences in National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP) math scores between boys and girls nearly double from the 9-year-olds to the 17-year-olds. This inconsistency in which gender shows more achievement could be due to the fact that class grades, especially in middle and high school, usually depend on a student's completion of homework assignments, and studies have shown that girls report spending more time on homework than boys. The gender gap in mathematics is particularly large among the highest-achieving students; for example, there is a 2.1 to 1 male-female ratio among students who score an 800 on the math portion of the SAT.\nAt least one study has challenged the existence of the gender gap in mathematics. In 2008 Janet Hyde and others published a study showing that male and female students did equally well on No Child Left Behind standardized tests that were administered in second through eleventh grades in ten states. However, Hyde and her team did find gaps that favored males at the upper end of the achievement distribution and tried to examine gaps on more difficult test questions (previous research has shown that males outperform females on more challenging items), but the tests they examined lacked adequately challenging items. This raised questions about whether there is still a gender gap in math achievement.\nThere is also a large discrepancy between the number of men and women working in STEM fields. Women have been, and continue to be, underrepresented in these fields. This underrepresentation is evident in the distribution of college majors among men and women; from 1997 to 2007, women earned only 18% of engineering bachelor's degrees.\nAccording to recent data, 55 percent of college students are females and 45 percent are males. From 1995 until 2005, the number of males enrolled in college increased by 18 percent, while the number of female students rose by 27 percent. Males are enrolling in college in greater numbers than ever before, yet fewer than two-thirds of them are graduating with a bachelor's degree. The numbers of both men and women receiving a bachelor's degree have increased significantly, but the increasing rate of female college graduates exceeds the increasing rate for males.\nIn 2014, the percentage of women with bachelor's degrees was higher than the percentage of men with bachelor's degrees for the first time in America. Women also earn more master's degrees and doctorates than men.\nAlthough more women are graduating with undergraduate degrees, men are still earning disproportionately more in their lifetimes. This could be due to many factors, including different types of jobs for males and females. Females are greatly underrepresented in science and engineering fields, which are typically correlated with high lifetime earnings. Males and females also have vastly different labor market histories based on type of job and time spent in each job."], "wikipedia-33541929": ["The racial achievement gap in the United States refers to the educational disparities between various ethnic groups. It manifests itself in a variety of ways: among students, blacks and Hispanics are more likely to receive lower grades, score lower on standardized tests, drop out of high school, and they are less likely to enter and complete college than whites, while whites score lower than Asian Americans.\n\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.\nOver the past 45 years, students in the United States have made notable gains in academic achievement. However, racial achievement gaps remain because not all groups of students are advancing at the same rates. Evidence of the racial achievement gaps have been manifested through standardized test scores, high school dropout rates, high school completion rates, college acceptance and retention rates, as well as through longitudinal trends. While efforts to close racial achievement gaps have increased over the years with varying success, studies have shown that disparities still exist between achievement levels of differing ethnic groups.\n\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:Early schooling years.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:Early schooling years.:Kindergarten through fifth grade.\nRacial achievement gaps have been found to exist before students enter kindergarten for their first year of schooling. At the start of kindergarten, Hispanic and black students have math and reading scores substantially lower than those of white students. While both Hispanics and blacks scores have significantly lower test scores than their white counterparts, Hispanic and black have scores that are roughly equal to each other. In a study published in 2009, Reardon and Galindo (2009) specifically examine test scores by race and ethnicity. The data Reardon and Galindo (2009) use comes from the ECLS-K, sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics. The ECLS-K contains data on a nationally representative sample of approximately 21,400 students from the kindergarten class of 1998\u20131999. Students in the sample were assessed in reading and mathematics skills six times from 1998 to 2004. The content areas of the tests are based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) fourth-grade content areas, adapted to be age appropriate at each grade level. The assessments were scored using a three-parameter Item Response Theory (IRT) model. Reardon and Galindo (2009) found that average Hispanic and black students begin kindergarten with math scores three quarters of a standard deviation lower than those of white students and with reading scores a half standard deviation lower than those of white students. Six years later, Hispanic-white gaps narrow by roughly a third, whereas black-white gaps widen by about a third. More specifically, the Hispanic-white gap is a half standard deviation in math, and three-eighths in reading at the end of fifth grade. The trends in the Hispanic-white gaps are especially interesting because of the rapid narrowing that occurs between kindergarten and first grade. Specifically, the estimated math gap declines from 0.77 to 0.56 standard deviations, and the estimated reading gap from 0.52 to 0.29 in the roughly 18 months between the fall of kindergarten and the spring of first grade. In the four years from the spring of first grade through the spring of fifth grade, the Hispanic-white gaps narrow slightly to 0.50 standard deviations in math and widening slightly to 0.38 deviations in reading.\nChildren of Latino, Native, and African American heritage arrive to kindergarten and first grade with lower levels of oral language, reading, and mathematics skill than Caucasian and Asian American children. It is estimated that the achievement gap could drastically be shortened if the performance gap at school entrance is addressed.\n\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:Early schooling years.:Third through eighth grade.\nIn a 2009 study Clotfelter et al. examine test scores of elementary and middle school students by race. The data used in the study comes from administrative records created by North Carolina's Department of Public Instruction and maintained by the North Carolina Education Research Data Center and are not nationally representative. North Carolina requires all students to take standardized achievement tests in both math and reading at the end of every grade between grades 3 and 8. In order to make comparisons across years, Clotfelter et al. (2009) normalized the scaled scores for each test in every year over all students in the state who took the test so that each test would have a mean score of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. On this normalized scale, positive scores denote above-average performances relative to the statewide average, and negative scores denote below-average performance. Analysis by Clotfelter et al. (2009) found gaps between four different racial groups: whites, Asians, Hispanics, and blacks. Essentially, while the black-white gaps are substantial, both Hispanic and Asian students tend to gain on whites as they progress in school. The white-black achievement gap in math scores is about half a standard deviation, and the white-black achievement gap in reading is a little less than half a standard deviation. By fifth grade, Hispanic and white students have roughly the same math and reading scores. By eighth grade, scores for Hispanic students in North Carolina surpassed those of observationally equivalent whites by roughly a tenth of a standard deviation. Asian students surpass whites on math and reading tests in all years except third and fourth grade reading. In both fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math, African American students are about two and a half times as likely as white students to lack basic skills and only about one-third as likely to be proficient or advanced.\n\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:Early schooling years.:Secondary school.\nIn a 2006 study, LoGerfo, Nichols, and Reardon (2006) found that, starting in the eighth grade, white students have an initial advantage in reading achievement over black and Hispanic students but not Asian students. Using nationally representative data from by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)\u2014the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) and the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88), LoGerfo, Nichols, and Reardon (2006) claim that black students score 5.49 points lower than white students and Hispanic students score 4.83 points lower than white students on reading tests. These differences in initial status are compounded by differences in reading gains made during high school. Specifically, between ninth and tenth grades, white students gain slightly more than black students and Hispanic students, but white students gain less than Asian students. Between tenth and twelfth grades, white students gain at a slightly faster rate than black students, but white students gain at a slower rate than Hispanic students and Asian students.\nIn eighth grade, white students also have an initial advantage over black and Hispanic students in math tests. However, Asian students have an initial 2.71 point advantage over white students and keep pace with white students throughout high school. Between eighth and tenth grade, black students and Hispanic students make slower gains in math than white students, and black students fall farthest behind. Asian students gain 2.71 points more than white students between eight and tenth grade. Some of these differences in gains persist later in high school. For example, between tenth and twelfth grades, white students gain more than black students, and Asian students gain more than white students. There are no significant differences in math gains between white students and Hispanic students. By the end of high school, gaps between groups increase slightly. Specifically, the initial 9-point advantage of white students over black students increases by about a point, and the initial advantage of Asian students over white students also increases by about a point. Essentially, by the end of high school, Asian students are beginning to learn intermediate-level math concepts, whereas black and Hispanic students are far behind, learning fractions and decimals, which are math concepts that the white and Asian students learned in the eighth grade. Black and Hispanic students end twelfth grade with scores 11 and 7 points behind those of white students, while the male-female difference in math scores is only around 2 points.\n\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:Standardized test scores.\nThe racial group differences across admissions tests, such as the SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, MCAT, LSAT, Advanced Placement Program examinations and other measures of educational achievement, have been fairly consistent. Since the 1960s, the population of students taking these assessments has become increasingly diverse. Consequently, the examination of ethnic score differences have been more rigorous. Specifically, the largest gaps exist between white and African American students. On average, they score about .82 to 1.18 standard deviations lower than white students in composite test scores. Following closely behind is the gap between white and Hispanic students. Asian American students overall performance were higher than those of White students except Asian American students performed one quarter standard deviation unit lower on the SAT verbal section, and about one half a standard deviation unit higher in the GRE Quantitative test.\nHowever, in the new current version of the SAT, Asian-American students of Taiwanese, Korean, Japanese, Indian and Han Chinese descent have scored higher on both the verbal and math sections of the new SAT test than whites and all other student racial groups.\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress reports the national Black-White gap and the Hispanic-White Gap in math and reading assessments, measured at the 4th and 8th grade level. The trends show both gaps widen in mathematics as students grow older, but tend to stay the same in reading. Furthermore, the NAEP measures the widening and narrowing of achievement gaps on a state level. From 2007 to 2009, the achievement gaps for the majority of states stayed the same, although more fluctuations were seen at the 8th grade level than the 4th grade level.\nThe Black-White Gap demonstrates:\nBULLET::::- In mathematics, a 26-point difference at the 4th grade level and a 31-point difference at the...", "BULLET::::- In mathematics, a 21-point difference at the 4th grade level and a 26-point difference at the 8th grade level.\nBULLET::::- In reading, there is a 25-point difference at the 4th grade level and a 24-point difference at the 8th grade level (NAEP, 2011).\nThe National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS, 1988) demonstrates similar findings in their evaluation of assessments administered to 12th graders in reading and math.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:Standardized test scores.:Mathematics.\nResults of the mathematics achievement test:\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:Standardized test scores.:Reading.\nResults of the reading achievement test:\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:High school dropout rates.\nAccording to the US Department of Education, event dropout rate is the percentage of high school students who dropped out of high school between the beginning of one school year and the beginning of the next school year. Five out of every 100 students enrolled in high school in October 2000 left school before October 2001 without successfully completing a high school program. The percentage of students who were event dropouts decreased from 1972 through 1987. However, despite some year-to-year fluctuations, the percentage of students dropping out of school each year has stayed relatively the same since 1987. Data from the October 2001 Current Population Survey (CPS) show that black and Hispanic students were more likely to have dropped out of high school between October 2000 and October 2001 than were white or Asians/Pacific Islander students. During this period, 6.3% of black and 8.8% of Hispanic high school students dropped out compared to 4.1% of white and 2.3% of Asian/Pacific Islander high school students.\nAccording to the US Department of Education, status dropout rates measure the percentage of individuals who are not enrolled in high school and who lack a high school credential, independent of when they dropped out. Status rates are higher than event rates because they include all dropouts in this age range, regardless of when they last attended school or whether or not they ever entered the US education system. In October 2001, about 3.8 million 16- through 24-year-olds were not enrolled in a high school program and had not completed high school. These individuals accounted for 10.7% of the 35.2 million 16- through 24-year-olds in the United States in 2001. In 1972, the white status dropout rate was 40% and the black status dropout rate was 49%. Because the black rate declined more steeply than the white rate, there has been a narrowing of the gap between the dropout rates for blacks and whites. However, this narrowing occurred in the 1980s, and the gap between whites and blacks has remained fairly constant since 1990. The percentage of Hispanics who were status dropouts has remained higher than that of blacks and whites in every year since 1970. Even though Hispanics represented approximately the same percentage of the young adult population as did blacks, Hispanics were disproportionately represented among status dropouts in 2001. Also in 2001, the status dropout rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders ages 16\u201324 was lower than for any other 16- through 24-year-olds. Specifically, the status rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders was 3.6%, compared with 27.0% for Hispanics, 20.9% for blacks, and 7.3% for whites.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:High school completion rates.\nStatus completion rates measure the percentage of a given population that has a high school credential, regardless of when the credential was earned. In 2001, 86.5% of 18- through 24-year-olds not enrolled in elementary or secondary school had completed high school. Status completion rates increased from 82.8% in 1972 to 85.6% in 1990. Since 1991, the rate has shown no consistent trend and has fluctuated between 84.8% and 86.5%. High school status completion rates for white and black young adults increased between the early 1970s and 1990 but has remained relatively the same since 1990. Specifically, status completion rates for white students increased from 86.0% in 1972 to 89.6% in 1990. Since 1990, white completion rates have remained in the range of 89.4\u201391.8%. In 2001, 91.0% of white and 85.6% of black 18- through 24-year-olds had completed high school. The percentage of black students completing high school rose from 72.1% in 1972 to 85.6% in 2001. The gap between black and white completion rates narrowed between 1972 and 2001. In 2001, 65.7% of all Hispanic 18- through 24-year- olds completed high school. This percentage compares to 91.0% of whites, 85.6% of blacks, and 96.1% of Asians/Pacific Islanders. Essentially, in 2001, whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders were more likely than their black and Hispanic peers to have completed high school. Also, whites completed high school at a higher rate than both blacks and Hispanic students. Black students completed high school at a higher rate than Hispanics.\nThe four-year completion rate is the percentage of 9th-grade students who left school over a subsequent 4-year period while also completing a high school credential. Data for the 4-year completion rate calculations are taken from the Common Core of Data (CCD). The 4-year completion rate calculation is dependent on the availability of dropout estimates over a 4-year span, and current counts of completers. Because dropout rate information was missing for many states during the 4-year period considered by the US Department of Education, 4- year completion rate estimates for the 2000-01 school year are only available for 39 states. Since data were not available from all states, an overall national rate could not be calculated. However, among reporting states, the high school 4-year completion rates for public school students ranged from a high of 90.1% in North Dakota to a low of 65.0% in Louisiana.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:SAT scores.\nRacial and ethnic variations in SAT scores follow a similar pattern to other racial achievement gaps. In 1990, the average SAT was 528 for Asian-Americans, 491 for whites, 429 for Mexican Americans and 385 for blacks. 34% of Asians compared with 20% of whites, 3% of blacks, 7% of Mexican Americans, and 9% of Native Americans scored above a 600 on the SAT math section. On the SAT verbal section in 1990, whites scored an average of 442, compared with 410 for Asians, 352 for blacks, 380 for Mexican Americans, and 388 for Native Americans. \nIn 2015, the average SAT scores on the math section were 598 for Asian-Americans, 534 for whites, 457 for Hispanic Latinos and 428 for blacks. \nAdditionally, 10% of Asian-Americans, 8% of whites, 3% of Mexican Americans, 3% of Native Americans and 2% of blacks scored above 600 on the SAT verbal section in 1990.\nRace gaps on the SATs are especially pronounced at the tails of the distribution. In a perfectly equal distribution, the racial breakdown of scores at every point in the distribution should ideally mirror the demographic composition of test-takers as whole i.e. 51% whites, 21% Hispanic Latinos, 14% blacks, and 14% Asian-Americans. But ironically, among the highest top scorers, those scoring between a 750 and 800 (perfect scores) over 60% are East Asians of Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean and Han Chinese descent, while only 33% are white, compared to 5% Hispanic Latinos and 2% blacks.\nThere are some limitations to the data which may mean that, if anything, the race gap is being understated. The ceiling on the SAT score may, for example, understate the achievement and full potential of East Asians of Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean and Han Chinese descent. If the exam was redesigned to increase score variance (add harder and easier questions than it currently has), the achievement gap across racial groups could be even more wider and pronounced. In other words, if the math section was scored between 0 and 1000, we might see more complete tails on both the right and the left. More East Asians score between 750 and 800 than score between 700 and 750, suggesting that many East Asians of Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean and Han Chinese descent could be scoring high above 800 if the test allowed them to.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:College enrollment and graduation rates.\nThe US Department in Education demonstrates performance of different ethnic groups in colleges and universities. Specifically, they found that about 72% of White students who have completed high school enrolled in college the same year, compared to 44% for Black students, and 50% for Hispanic students. Furthermore, trends in undergraduate and graduate enrollment have shown increases in all ethnicity groups, but the largest gap still exists for Black student enrollment. Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islanders student enrollment have experienced the most growth since 1976. The...", "Because of small population size in the 1970s, similar trend data are not available for Asian Americans. Data from the 1990 NAEP Mathematics Assessment Tests show that among twelfth graders, Asians scored an average of 315 points compared with 301 points for whites, 270 for blacks, 278 for Hispanics, and 290 for Native Americans. Racial and ethnic differentiation is most apparent at the highest achievement levels. Specifically, 13% of Asians performed at level of 350 points or higher, 6% of whites, less than 1% of blacks, and 1% of Hispanics did so.\nThe NAEP has since collected and analyzed data through 2008. Overall, the White-Hispanic and the White-Black gap for NAEP scores have significantly decreased since the 1970s.\nThe Black-White Gap demonstrates:\nBULLET::::- In mathematics, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 14 points from 1973 to 2008.\nBULLET::::- In reading, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 24 points from 1971 to 2008.\nThe Hispanic-White Gap demonstrates:\nBULLET::::- In mathematics, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 12 points from 1973 to 2008.\nBULLET::::- In reading, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 15 points from 1975 to 2008.\nFurthermore, subgroups showed predominant gains in 4th grade at all achievement levels. In terms of achieving proficiency, gaps between subgroups in most states have narrowed across grade levels, yet had widened in 23% of instances. The progress made in elementary and middle schools was greater than that in high schools, which demonstrates the importance of early childhood education. Greater gains were seen in lower-performing subgroups rather than in higher-performing subgroups. Similarly, greater gains were seen in Latino and African American subgroups than for low-income and Native American subgroups.", "In the United States, most minority groups are more likely to live in poverty than White Americans. Unemployment rate and mortgages for African and Latin Americans are usually higher than White Americans'. And although Asian American families earn, on average, more income than White American families do, there are usually more family members working in the Asian American family than the White American family. These disparities in socioeconomic status between minority groups and White Americans help explain differences in parenting styles, family structure, and the resultant educational achievement of minority children. However, the racial gaps persists when comparing families with similar income. Whites from families with incomes below $10,000 had a mean SAT test score that was 61 points higher than blacks whose families had incomes of between $80,000 and $100,000.", "Differences in the academic performance of African-American and White students exist even in schools that are desegregated and diverse, and studies have shown that a school's racial mix does not seem to have much effect on changes in reading scores after sixth grade, or on math scores at any age. In fact, minority students in segregated-minority schools have more optimism and greater educational aspirations as well as achievements than minority students in segregated-white schools. This can be attributed to various factors, including the attitudes of faculty and staff at segregated-white schools and the effect of stereotype threat."], "wikipedia-56970574": ["The Discourse is based on evidence and assumptions of why primarily poor students of color do not perform at the same levels as their more affluent White and certain Asian group counterparts- it creates language to how schools and communities can be organized more optimally to help students and schools produce more equitable and successful outcomes. The Achievement Gap also addresses a gender gap achievement, and standardized test score gaps broadly across countries, notably with standardized examinations on STEM subjects. The Discourse can also be seen as a turning away from traditional explanations of performance in school as individualistic, to the creation of cultural framework understanding to help explain what conventions hinder and produce successful students. \"Under performing, adequate yearly progress (AYP), highly qualified, below basic, and proficient\" are some terms used to mark good and bad aspects of schools, their teachers, and their students which in turn reifies the Achievement Gap theory. As a broader Discourse, it is an idea which is multimodally shared and accepted as common belief between parents, policy makers, teachers and students through various means according to James Paul Gee\u2019s idea of Discourse in socio-linguistic analysis.\n\nThe Achievement Gap Discourse initiated with two primary modes in American educational studies: Achievement Gap among races, and gap among socioeconomic status (SES). \"The gap Discourse\" does not typically extend across generations or other forms of demographics that have been studied, and further study of Achievement Gap among different dimensions faces the initial stigmatization as a result of the gap Discourse in various studies around the turn of the 21st Century, pin-headed by the 30 million Word Gap. Among critics are many linguists, anthropologists, and social discipline specialists, as well as organizations such as the Linguistic Society of America.\n\nThe achievement gap became an especially strong interest for study in the turn of the century, and the early 2000s when a plethora of studies looked at factors such as standardized test scores, presence in class, GPA, enrollment, and dropout rates in secondary and post-secondary education. The problem came in the analyses of the studies which were criticized for looking at race and socioeconomic explanations to explain educational outcome without taking into account others such as S. J. Lee, 2005, Pang, Kiang, & Pak, 2004, and Rothstein 2004 which provided broad postulations as to why race and SES accounted for varied success."], "wikipedia-20381835": ["Unequal educational outcomes are attributed to several variables, including family of origin, gender, and social class. Achievement, earnings, health status, and political participation also contribute to educational inequality within the United States and other countries.\n\nSection::::Family background.\nIn Harvard's \"Civil Rights Project\", Lee and Orfield identify family background as the most influential factor in student achievement. A correlation exists between the academic success of parents with the academic success of their children. Only 11% of children from the bottom fifth earn a college degree while 80% of the top fifth earn one. Linked with resources, white students tend to have more educated parents than students from minority families. This translates to a home-life that is more supportive of educational success. This often leads to them receiving more at-home help, have more books in their home, attend more libraries, and engage in more intellectually intensive conversations. Children, then, enter school at different levels. Poor students are behind in verbal memory, vocabulary, math and reading achievement, and have more behavior problems. This leads to their placement in different level classes that tracks them. These courses almost always demand less from their students, creating a group that is conditioned to lack educational drive. These courses are generally non-college bound and are taught by less qualified teachers.\n\nAlso, family background influences cultural knowledge and perceptions. Middle class knowledge of norms and customs allows students with this background to better navigate the school system. Parents from this class and above also have social networks that prove to be more beneficial than networks based in lower classes. These connections may help students gain access to the right schools, activities, etc. Additionally, children from poorer families, who are often minorities, come from families that distrust institutions. America's history of racism and discrimination has created a perceived and/or existent ceiling on opportunities for many poor and minority citizens. This ceiling muffles academic inspirations and muffles growth.\n\nThe recent and drastic increase of Latino immigrants has created another major factor in educational inequality. As more and more students come from families where English is not spoken at home, they often struggle with overcoming a language barrier in addition to simply learning subjects. They more frequently lack assistance at home because it is common for the parents to not understand the work that is in English.\n\nFurthermore, research reveals summer months as crucial time for the educational development of children. Students from disadvantaged families experience greater losses in skills during summer vacation. Students from lower socioeconomic classes come disproportionately from single-parent homes and dangerous neighborhoods. 15% of white children are raised in single-parent homes and 10% of Asian children are. 27% of Latinos are raised in single-parent homes and 54% of African American children are. Less resources, less parental attention, and more stress all influence the performance of children in school.\n\nSection::::Gender.\nThroughout the world, educational achievement varies by gender. The exact relationship differs across cultural and national contexts.\n\nSection::::Gender.:Female disadvantage.\nObstacles preventing females' ability to receive a quality education include traditional attitudes towards gender roles, poverty, geographical isolation, gender-based violence, and early marriage and pregnancy. Throughout the world, there is an estimated 7 million more girls than boys out of school. This \"girls gap\" is concentrated in several countries including Somalia, Afghanistan, Togo, the Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, girls are outnumbered two to one.\n\nSocialized gender roles affect females' access to education. For example, in Nigeria, children are socialized into their specific gender role as soon as their parents know their gender. Men are the preferred gender and are encouraged to engage in computer and scientific learning while the women learn domestic skills. These gender roles are deep rooted within the state, however, with the increase of westernized education within Nigeria, there has been a recent increase in women having the ability to receive an equal education. There is still much to be changed, though. Nigeria still needs policies that encourage educational attainment for men and women based on merit, rather than gender.\n\nFemales are shown to be at risk of being attacked in at least 15 countries. Attacks can occur because individuals within those countries do not believe women should receive an education. Attacks include kidnappings, bombings, torture, rape and murder. In Somalia, girls have been abducted. In Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Libya students were reported to have been raped and harassed. In Pakistan and Afghanistan, schools and busses have been bombed and gassed.\n\nEarly marriage affects females' ability to receive an education.\n\n\"The gap separating men and women in the job market remains wide in many countries, whether in the North or the South. With marginal variables between most countries, women have a lower employment rate, are unemployed longer, are paid less and have less secure jobs.\" \"Young women, particularly suffer double discrimination. First for being young, in the difficult phase of transition between training and working life, in an age group that has, on an average, twice the jobless rate or older workers and are at the mercy of employers who exploit them under the pretext of enabling them to acquire professional experience. Secondly they are discriminated against for being women and are more likely to be offered low paying or low status jobs.\" \"Discrimination is still very much in evidence and education and training policies specially targeting young women are needed to restore a balance.\" \"Although young women are increasingly choosing typically 'male' professions, they remain over-represented in traditionally female jobs, such as secretaries, nurses, and under represented in jobs with responsibility and the professions.\"\n\nIn early grades, boys and girls perform equally in mathematics and science, but boys score higher on advanced mathematics assessments such as the SAT college entrance examination. Girls are also less likely to participate in class discussions and more likely to be silent in the classroom. Some believe that females have a way of thinking and learning that is different than males. Belenky and colleagues (1986) conducted research which found that there was an inconsistency between the kind of knowledge appealing to women and the kind of knowledge being taught in most educational institutions. Another researcher, Gilligan (1982), found that the knowledge appealing to females was caring, interconnection, and sensitivity to the needs of others, while males found separation and individualism appealing. Females are more field dependent, or group oriented, than males, which could explain why they may experience problems in schools that primarily teach using an individualistic learning environment.\n\nSection::::Gender.:Male disadvantage.\nIn 51 countries, girls are enrolled at higher rates than boys. Particularly in Latin America, the difference is attributed to prominence of gangs and violence attracting male youth. The gangs pull the males in, distracting them from school and causing them to drop out.\n\nIn some countries, female high school and graduation rates are higher than for males. In the United States for example, 33% more bachelor's degrees were conferred on females than males in 2010\u20132011. This gap is projected to increase to 37% by 2021\u20132022, and is over 50% for master's and associate degrees. Dropout rates for males has also increased over the years in all racial groups, especially in African Americans. They have exceeded the number of high school and college dropout rates than any other racial ethnicity for the past 30 years. A majority of the research found that males were primarily the most \"left behind\" in education because of higher graduation dropout rates, lower test scores, and failing grades. They found that as males get older, primarily from ages 9 to 17, they are less likely to be labeled \"proficient\" in reading and mathematics than girls were.\n\nIn general, males arrive in kindergarten much less ready and prepared for schooling than females. This creates a gap that continually increases over time into middle and high school. Nationally, there", "Males get worse grades than females do regardless of year or country examined in most subjects. In the U.S. Women are more likely to have earned a bachelor's degree than men by the age of 29. Female students graduate high school at a higher rate than male students. In the U.S. in 2003, 72 percent of female students graduated, compared with 65 percent of male students.\nThe gender gap in graduation rates is particularly large for minority students. Men are under-represented among both graduate students and those who successfully complete master's and doctoral degrees in the U.S. Causes include boys having worse self-regulation skills than girls and being more sensitive to school-quality and home environment than girls. Boys perceiving education as feminine and lacking educated male role-models also contributes to males being less likely to complete college. In the U.S., male students perform worse on reading tests and read less than their female counterparts in part because males are more physically active, more aggressive, less compliant, and because school reading curricula do not match their interests. Teacher Bias in grading accounts for 21% of the male deficit in grades. The male disadvantage in education is independent of inequality in social and economic participation.\nSection::::Race.\nSection::::Race.:United States only.\nRace and ethnics have played a major role in the inequalities of the American Education system.\nDifferences of academic skills in children of different race starts at an early age, according to National Assessment of Educational Progress there is a remaining gap showing Black and Latino children being able to demonstrate cognitive proficiency compared to their White counterparts. In the data 89 percent of White children presented the ability to understand written and spoken words while only 79 and 78 percent of Black and Latino children were able to comprehend written and spoken words the trend would continue into ages 4\u20136. Experts believe that the racial differences in academic achievement fall under three major categories: genetic, cultural, and structural. For example, in the 1980s minorities experienced a cultural phenomenon called \"fear of acting White\", minorities would shun and ridicule those in their social groups who had shown a higher intelligence than others. Shown in a graph comparing popularity to grade point average among Blacks, Latinos, and Whites built based on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health popularity of White students increased as their grades increased, for Black and Latino students popularity would drop as grades would rise. Race and ethnics will continue to play a major role in the disbursement of education through the American public school system, through diversity placement programs such as SEO and MLT, grants and social and cultural changes the education gap has slowly been closing between Whites and minorities in more recent years.\nSection::::Immigration status.\nSection::::Immigration status.:In the United States.\nThe Immigrant paradox states that immigrants, who are disadvantaged by inequality, may use their disadvantages as a source of motivation. A study from New York showed that children of immigrant descent outperformed their native student counterparts.The paradox explains that the gratefulness of immigrant children allows them to enjoy academic advantages that may not have been accessible at one time. This in turn allows for more effort and better outcomes from these students. This was also evident in the National Education Longitudinal Study which showed that immigrant children many times outperformed on math and science tests. Grace Keo reported that \u201cevidence of the immigrant advantage was stronger from Asian immigrant families than for youth from Latin American\u201d, which may cause some inequality in itself. This may vary depending on differences between pre and post migration conditions.\nIn 2010, researchers from Brown University published research on immigrants. Some of their conclusions were that first-generation immigrant children show lower levels of delinquency and bad behaviors than second or third generation children, and that first-generation immigrant children often start behind American-born children in school, but they catch up quickly and have high rates of learning growth."], "wikipedia-53734674": ["Due to poverty being a significant factor in determining academic achievement, students who reside in impoverished communities historically perform lower than students from affluent communities as a result of lack of parental and school resources, quality teachers, and updated teaching materials. Moreover, students who reside in communities with a low socioeconomic status are often students of color. In more recent research within the 21st century regarding education inequality there is evidence that students who come from low socioeconomic backgrounds and communities of color are more likely to experience the juvenile justice system or incarceration at some point in their life; this is referred to as the school-to-prison pipeline.", "The achievement gap describes the inconsistencies in standardized test scores, rates of high school and college completion, grade point average between students of color (Black and Latino) and White students. It is significant because White students tend to achieve far more academically compared to Black and Latino students. Latino and Black students have some of the lowest college school completion rates in the United States, on average, they also have lower literacy rates in school, and lag behind White students in terms of math and science proficiency. It is important to understand that these discrepancies have long-term achievement effects on Latino and Black students.\nThere are several factors that can explain the achievement gap. Among some of the most studied and popular theories are that predominantly Black/Latino schools are concentrated in low SES neighborhoods that do not receive adequate resources to invest in their student\u2019s education (such as the ability to pay for qualified teachers) and that parental influence in Black and Latino families lags behind White families in terms of involvement in school. Family influence is significant as is seen by a study that demonstrated how high levels of parental involvement in low income communities can actually assist in mitigating the achievement gap."], "wikipedia-3363994": ["The loss in learning varies across grade level, subject matter, and family income. A common finding across numerous studies is that on average, students score lower on standardized tests at the end of the summer than they do at the beginning of summer (on the same test). Summer loss for all students is estimated to be equal to about 1 month (Cooper 1996), but this varies across subject matter:\nBULLET::::- Mathematics - 2.6 months of grade-level equivalency loss\nBULLET::::- Reading- Varies across SES. Low income students generally lose about 2 months of reading achievement. Middle income students experience slight gains in reading performances.\nFor over a century, scholars have recognized that summer vacation is a period when students\u2019 rate of academic development declines relative to the school year. All children lose academic skills during the summer months, and family socioeconomic status (SES) is highly correlated to the level of academic growth or decline in the summer months. Two-thirds of the academic achievement gap in reading and language found among high school students has been explained through the learning loss that occurs during the summer months of the primary school years.\nA meta-analysis of 39 studies conducted since 1978 found that in the absence of school, all students score lower on standardized math tests at the end of the summer as compared to their performance on the same tests at the beginning of summer. This loss was most acute in factual and procedural learning such as mathematical computation, where an average setback of more than two months of grade-level equivalency was observed among both middle- and lower-class students. In reading and language, however, substantial differences were found between middle- and lower-class students. Whereas middle-class students showed a nonsignificant gain in reading scores, lower-class students showed a significant loss that represented a gap of about three months of grade-level equivalent reading skills between middle- and lower-class students.\nThese results are consistent with other researcher's findings that a family\u2019s socioeconomic status affects children\u2019s achievement scores almost exclusively when school is closed. Barbara Heyns\u2019 1978 landmark study of 2,978 6th and 7th graders in the Atlanta city public schools was the first thorough investigation of summer learning. Heyns found that while poor children and black children came close to keeping up with middle-class children in cognitive growth when school was in session, they lagged far behind during the summer.\nResearchers Doris Entwistle and Karl Alexander extended Barbara Heyns\u2019 line of research through the Beginning School Study (BSS) in 1982. BSS compared the school-year and summer achievement gains of 790 youth across 20 of Baltimore\u2019s public schools from the beginning of first grade in 1982 through the end of elementary school. The study also tracked these students\u2019s progress through high school and college. They found that in year nine, the low-socioeconomic status (SES) group\u2019s Reading Comprehension average lagged 73 points behind the high-SES group\u2019s on the California Achievement Test (CAT-V). About a third of the 73 points difference (27 points) was in place when the students started first grade. After the first grade, the low-SES students fall farther behind each year, with the gap reaching a plateau of around 70 points in the 5th grade. The remaining two-thirds of the 73 point gap accumulate over the course of the elementary and middle school years, with a staggering 48.5 points being attributed to the cumulative summer learning gap from the five elementary years. As this data shows, virtually the entire achievement gap reflects differences between low-SES and high-SES students\u2019 home environments, with cognitive gains during the school year being relatively equal between both groups.\nResearchers from The Ohio State University extended summer learning gap research further by conducting a national study of 17,000 kindergarten and first grade children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study. The authors confirmed earlier findings of an unequal starting point, showing that a standard deviation\u2019s advantage in SES predicts a 1.77 month advantage in initial reading skill on the first day of kindergarten. The authors also confirmed that the SES achievement gap continues to grow after schooling starts, with summer learning accounting for the vast majority of the difference. While the average kindergarten learning rate was 1.65 test points per month, a standard deviation\u2019s advantage in SES predicted a relative gain of 0.16 points per month during summer, 0.07 points per month during kindergarten, and 0.05 points per month during first grade."], "wikipedia-2449242": ["The achievement gap refers to the academic disparity between certain groups, including African-Americans, Latinos, students whose first language is not English, and students living in poverty, that perform significantly below others. This gap extends beyond the results of standardized test scores and also applies to the disparity between certain groups regarding dropout rates, participation in honors classes and Advanced Placement (AP) exams, and numbers of students admitted to colleges. Due to Berkeley High School's racially, ethnically and socio-economically diverse student population, it has been called the \"most integrated high school in America.\" However an achievement gap continues to exist between the white students and black and Latino students. For example, for the 2017-18 school year, the percentages of white students who graduated with the requirements for the UC application fulfilled was 86%, compared to 40% of black students and 50% of Latino students. In 2015, the graduation rate for English learners was 68%--much lower than any other group. Beyond academics and looking at student performance and behavior, \"white and hispanic students are suspended less frequently than African-American students,\" and black students are much more frequently expelled, drop out, are absent, and/or are enrolled in remedial classes and special education. Regarding post-graduation, \"many white and Asian students graduate with honors and attend elite colleges and universities, while few blacks and Latino students follow a similar path.\""]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

In this context, procrastination is a symptom of systemic issues in education, rather than an individual failure or a root cause of academic underperformance as early research tends to assume. On the other hand, the link between inequality in in-class procrastination and end-of-course performance gaps highlights procrastination as a behavioral antecedent of educational inequality. This micro-level behavioral factor, susceptible to structural external forces and grounded in research on meta-cognition [37], can add granular insights about the development of macro-level achievement gaps through the depiction of associated psychological processes.

We define the procrastination score for each submission \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 as \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50) / |\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50| (1) where \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 is the timestamp of the submission, |\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50| is the total number of submissions to the same assignment, and \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50) = |\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 \u2264 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50; \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc61 \u2208 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50| is the rank order in terms of the submission time. Ties between submission times are assigned their average rank. By this definition, the later the submission, the more the student procrastinates on this assignment, and the higher this score. We also illustrate in Figure 1 how this assignment-level procrastination score varies for three arbitrary students in a course with 30 assignments. Compared to, for instance, the absolute time difference between the submission and deadline, this approach is highly scalable for two reasons. First, it does not rely on information about due dates, which instructors across thousands of courses may implement in inconsistent ways. Second, a percentile rank is normalized for assignments and courses, which makes it easy to aggregate and compare them across assignments, courses, and students. For the main analysis, we aggregate the procrastination score to the student-course level by averaging over assignments in a course: \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50 = 1 / |\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc50| \u2211 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 (2) where \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc50 = {\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50} is the set of all assignments in course \ud835\udc50 and |\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc50| is the count of these assignments."], "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/0": ["We analyze 2,631,893 submission records by 25,659 students across 2,153 courses and propose a context-agnostic procrastination score for each student in each course based on their assignment submission times relative to classmates."], "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/18": ["To understand the magnitude of these differences, we plot the mean procrastination score for each subgroup on the same scale in Figure 3.

We find that this is the case for female students, continuing-generation college students, and non-URM students, but not their counterparts.

He showed that, in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, and apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, and thereby lower levels of growth. He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment. Perotti concluded that, \"more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher rates of investment in education. Both are reflected in higher rates of growth. Also, very unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable, which is reflected in lower rates of investment and therefore growth.\"\n\nAccording to International Monetary Fund economists, inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells (not the rate of growth). High levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity, but also the quality of a country's institutions and high levels of education. According to IMF staff economists, \"if the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth. The poor and the middle class matter the most for growth via a number of interrelated economic, social, and political channels.\"\n\nAn OECD study in 2015, found that internationally \"countries where income inequality is decreasing grow faster than those with rising inequality\", and noted that \"a lack of investment in education by the poor is the main factor behind inequality hurting growth\"\n\nA 2017 study argued that there were both positive and negative effects of inequality: \"When inequality is associated with political instability and social unrest, rent seeking and distortive policies, lower capacities for investment in human capital, and a stagnant domestic market, it is mostly expected to harm long-run economic performance, as suggested by many authors. Accordingly, improving income distribution is expected to foster long-run economic growth, especially in low-income countries where the levels of inequality are usually very high. However, some degree of inequality can also be good, as has been theoretically argued in the literature and as empirically suggested in this study. A degree of inequality can play a beneficial role for economic growth when that inequality is driven by market forces and related to hard work and growth-enhancing incentives like risk taking, innovation, capital investment, and agglomeration economies. The challenge for policy makers is to control structural inequality, which reduces the country's capacities for economic development, while at the same time keeping in place those positive incentives that are also necessary for growth.\"", "While acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development, poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, it is becoming widely understood among the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth. The effect of economic growth on poverty reduction \u2013 the growth elasticity of poverty \u2013 can depend on the existing level of inequality. For instance, with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2% per head and 40% of its population living in poverty, can halve poverty in ten years, but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction. In the words of the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon: \"While economic growth is necessary, it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty.\" Competition policy intending to prevent companies from abusing market power contributes to inclusive growth."], "wikipedia-2023648": ["Nevertheless, inequalities related to class, gender, communities hinder the extent of human freedom and thus decrease our ability to function.

In addition, most patents related to nanotechnology are concentrated amongst few multinational corporations, including IBM, Micron Technologies, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. This has led to fears that it will be unlikely that developing countries will have access to the infrastructure, funding and human resources required to support nanotechnology research and development, and that this is likely to exacerbate such inequalities.\n\nProducers in developing countries could also be disadvantaged by the replacement of natural products (including rubber, cotton, coffee and tea) by developments in nanotechnology. These natural products are important export crops for developing countries, and many farmers' livelihoods depend on them. It has been argued that their substitution with industrial nano-products could negatively impact the economies of developing countries, that have traditionally relied on these export crops.\n\nIt is proposed that nanotechnology can only be effective in alleviating poverty and aid development \"when adapted to social, cultural and local institutional contexts, and chosen and designed with the active participation by citizens right from the commencement point\" (Invernizzi et al. 2008, p. 132)."], "wikipedia-45108666": ["Globalizing organizations and institutions such as the United Nations, and the World Bank have worked to promote gender equality.

For example, \u201cThe Beijing + 5 process provides an opportunity to reflect on the impact of Globalization in determining further actions and initiatives for the full implementation of the Beijing commitments\u201d. Furthermore, the ability to promote awareness is by default facilitated because, for example, in the nonagricultural sector, the total share percentage of women employed is at 48% from a 2012 report. Thus, when the gender binaries of male and female in the U.S. constitute half of the entire workforce respectively, the females that receive unequal treatment have the ability to speak out against the cause with the understanding that a high proportion of the public backs them.\n\nIt is only through a collective effort that gender equality can flourish.

This vision requires approaching learning analytics research and applications through a few different perspectives, such as algorithmic fairness [ 4, 23], value-sensitive and human-centered design [7, 10], and critical theories [45].

For the top 21 industrialised countries, counting each person equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = -.907). A similar relationship exists among US states (r = -.620).\n2013 Economics Nobel prize winner Robert J. Shiller said that rising inequality in the United States and elsewhere is the most important problem.\nThe economic stratification of society into \"elites\" and \"masses\" played a central role in the collapse of other advanced civilizations such as the Roman, Han, and Gupta empires.\nBritish researchers Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have found higher rates of health and social problems (obesity, mental illness, homicides, teenage births, incarceration, child conflict, drug use), and lower rates of social goods (life expectancy by country, educational performance, trust among strangers, women's status, social mobility, even numbers of patents issued) in countries and states with higher inequality. Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US, they found social/health problems lower in countries like Japan and Finland and states like Utah and New Hampshire with high levels of equality, than in countries (US and UK) and states (Mississippi and New York) with large differences in household income.\nPickett and Wilkinson argue that inequality and social stratification lead to higher levels of psychosocial stress and status anxiety which can lead to depression, chemical dependency, less community life, parenting problems and stress-related diseases.\nIn their book, Social Epidemiology, Ichiro Kawachi and S.V. Subramanian found that impoverished individuals simply cannot lead healthy lives as easily as the wealthy. They are unable to secure adequate nutrition for their families, cannot pay utility bills to keep themselves warm during the winter or cold during heat waves, and lack sufficient housing.\nResearch has shown an inverse link between income inequality and social cohesion. In more equal societies, people are much more likely to trust each other, measures of social capital (the benefits of goodwill, fellowship, mutual sympathy and social connectedness among groups who make up a social units) suggest greater community involvement, and homicide rates are consistently lower.\nThe economist Joseph Stiglitz has argued that economic inequality has led to distrust of business and government.\nCrime rate has also been shown to be correlated with inequality in society. Most studies looking into the relationship have concentrated on homicides \u2013 since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions. There have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger. Research has been conducted comparing developed countries with undeveloped countries, as well as studying areas within countries. Daly et al. 2001 found that among U.S. states and Canadian provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality. They estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state. Fajnzylber et al. (2002) found a similar relationship worldwide.\nFollowing the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number \u2013 economic inequality is problematic. A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, is an example of reduced \"distributive efficiency\" within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility. An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person (\"the additional dollar\") decreases as a person becomes richer. From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.", "Oxfam asserts that worsening inequality is impeding the fight against global poverty.

Oxfam Executive Director Jeremy Hobbs said that \"We can no longer pretend that the creation of wealth for a few will inevitably benefit the many \u2013 too often the reverse is true.\" The 2018 Oxfam report said that the income of the world's billionaires in 2017, $762 billion, was enough to end extreme global poverty seven times over.\nJared Bernstein and Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Institute suggest that poverty in the United States could have been significantly mitigated if inequality had not increased over the last few decades.\n\nIncome inequality has been the driving factor in the growing household debt, as high earners bid up the price of real estate and middle income earners go deeper into debt trying to maintain what once was a middle class lifestyle.\n\nCentral Banking economist Raghuram Rajan argues that \"systematic economic inequalities, within the United States and around the world, have created deep financial 'fault lines' that have made [financial] crises more likely to happen than in the past\" \u2013 the Financial crisis of 2007\u201308 being the most recent example. To compensate for stagnating and declining purchasing power, political pressure has developed to extend easier credit to the lower and middle income earners \u2013 particularly to buy homes \u2013 and easier credit in general to keep unemployment rates low. This has given the American economy a tendency to go \"from bubble to bubble\" fueled by unsustainable monetary stimulation.", "A 1999 review in the \"Journal of Economic Literature\" states high inequality lowers growth, perhaps because it increases social and political instability. The article also says:\nSomewhat unusually for the growth literature, studies have tended to concur in finding a negative effect of high inequality on subsequent growth. The evidence has not been accepted by all: some writers point out the concentration of richer countries at the lower end of the inequality spectrum, the poor quality of the distribution data, and the lack of robustness to fixed effects specifications. At least, though, it has become extremely difficult to build a case that inequality is good for growth. This in itself represents a considerable advance. Given the indications that inequality is harmful for growth, attention has moved on to the likely mechanisms... the literature seems to be moving ... towards an examination of the effects of inequality on fertility rates, investment in education, and political stability.\n\nAccording to International Monetary Fund economists, inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells (not the rate of growth). High levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity, but also the quality of a country's institutions and high levels of education. According to IMF staff economists, \"if the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth. The poor and the middle class matter the most for growth via a number of interrelated economic, social, and political channels.\"\n\nEconomist Joseph Stiglitz presented evidence in 2009 that both global inequality and inequality within countries prevent growth by limiting aggregate demand. Economist Branko Milanovic, wrote in 2001 that, \"The view that income inequality harms growth \u2013 or that improved equality can help sustain growth \u2013 has become more widely held in recent years. ... The main reason for this shift is the increasing importance of human capital in development. When physical capital mattered most, savings and investments were key. Then it was important to have a large contingent of rich people who could save a greater proportion of their income than the poor and invest it in physical capital. But now that human capital is scarcer than machines, widespread education has become the secret to growth.\"\n\nIMF economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries with high inequality have \"succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years\" but \"longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution.\"\n\nAn OECD study in 2015, found that internationally \"countries where income inequality is decreasing grow faster than those with rising inequality\", and noted that \"a lack of investment in education by the poor is the main factor behind inequality hurting growth\"\n\nA 2017 study argued that there were both positive and negative effects of inequality: \"When inequality is associated with political instability and social unrest, rent seeking and distortive policies, lower capacities for investment in human capital, and a stagnant domestic market, it is mostly expected to harm long-run economic performance, as suggested by many authors. Accordingly, improving income distribution is expected to foster long-run economic growth, especially in low-income countries where the levels of inequality are usually very high. However, some degree of inequality can also be good, as has been theoretically argued in the literature and as empirically suggested in this study. A degree of inequality can play a beneficial role for economic growth when that inequality is driven by market forces and related to hard work and growth-enhancing incentives like risk taking, innovation, capital investment, and agglomeration economies. The challenge for policy makers is to control structural inequality, which reduces the country's capacities for economic development, while at the same time keeping in place those positive incentives that are also necessary for growth.\"", "The view that income inequality harms growth \u2013 or that improved equality can help sustain growth \u2013 has become more widely held in recent years. ...

With the exception of Ireland, the countries at risk of default in 2011 (Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal) were notable for their high Gini-measured levels of income inequality compared to other European countries. As measured by the Gini index, Greece as of 2008 had more income inequality than the economically healthy Germany.\nSection::::Economic growth.:Equitable growth.\nWhile acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development, poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, it is becoming widely understood among the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth. The effect of economic growth on poverty reduction \u2013 the growth elasticity of poverty \u2013 can depend on the existing level of inequality. For instance, with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2% per head and 40% of its population living in poverty, can halve poverty in ten years, but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction. In the words of the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon: \"While economic growth is necessary, it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty.\" Competition policy intending to prevent companies from abusing market power contributes to inclusive growth."], "wikipedia-2023648": ["Nevertheless, inequalities related to class, gender, communities hinder the extent of human freedom and thus decrease our ability to function. That is why a good society ought to mitigate such discrimination, promoting people's freedom which, is the most valuable element of a satisfactory life."], "wikipedia-1271730": ["Many approaches have been used that consider the concepts of identity, societal structures, and representation to be mutually exclusive, but the introduction of Patricia Hill Collins\u2019 matrix of domination addresses the interlocking patterns of privilege and marginalization along the lines of race, class, gender, and class inside social institutions as well as at the community level. With this work has come greater recognition of the various effects that each identity holds in different societal contexts, in both the micro- and macro-level structures within the systems of oppression that exist.\n\nIn April Bernard's article, \u201cThe Intersectional Alternative: Explaining Female Criminality\u201d, Bernard applies Patricia Hill Collins\u2019 work to the study of feminist criminology, as a means of explaining the cumulative effects of identity in a system of oppression on women's decisions to commit a crime. Bernard employs an intersectional approach to dissect the complexities that act as determinant factors in a woman's decision to partake in criminal activities, and more specifically, the limiting pressures of a patriarchal society. In particular, this article is framed in response to Robert Merton's claims about deviance as a response to a lack of adequate resources to achieve cultural goals, as Bernard employs an intersectional paradigm model that explores female criminality as an expression of constraint and circumscription, rather than a \u201cstrained reality\u201d. With this alternative framework, Bernard suggests that societal goals are not unanimous, and are instead shaped by individuals\u2019 experiences in economic, political, and social spaces; for marginalized women, access to the means through which they build success are impacted by micro- and macro-level norms and histories that have created indicators of class (e.g. racial, economic, political, sexual) and subjugated them to limited networks. Thus, identity makes women with marginalized identities more vulnerable in the legal system, subjugates to oppressive states within multiple institutions, and creating a need for policies that move toward creating an equitable reality for them.\n\nIn the United States, especially, the matrix of domination has implications within the welfare state. Several sociological studies on the welfare state take note of state-market relations while ignoring the salient roles held by other identities such as gender, race, class, language, and age, among others. Due to the nature of the welfare state, there has not been much regard for exploring the existence of multiple axes of oppression which has led to lineation of categories of race, class, and gender. In \u201c\"Politics, Gender, and Concepts\"\u201d, Gary Goertz and Amy Mazur assert that literature about the welfare state should focus on the relationship between social positions and social policies, as well as provide a framework for investigations into the causal effects of class, gender, and race.

Nanoethicists posit that such a transformative technology could exacerbate the divisions of rich and poor \u2013 the so-called \u201cnano divide.\u201d However nanotechnology makes the production of technology, e.g. computers, cellular phones, health technology etcetera, cheaper and therefore accessible to the poor.

Some have put forth that international institutions dedicated specifically to nanotechnology (perhaps analogously to the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA) or general arms control may also be designed. One may also jointly make differential technological progress on defensive technologies. The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology also suggest some technical restrictions. Improved transparency regarding technological capabilities may be another important facilitator for arms-control.", "Concerns are frequently raised that the claimed benefits of nanotechnology will not be evenly distributed, and that any benefits (including technical and/or economic) associated with nanotechnology will only reach affluent nations. The majority of nanotechnology research and development - and patents for nanomaterials and products - is concentrated in developed countries (including the United States, Japan, Germany, Canada and France). In addition, most patents related to nanotechnology are concentrated amongst few multinational corporations, including IBM, Micron Technologies, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. This has led to fears that it will be unlikely that developing countries will have access to the infrastructure, funding and human resources required to support nanotechnology research and development, and that this is likely to exacerbate such inequalities.\nProducers in developing countries could also be disadvantaged by the replacement of natural products (including rubber, cotton, coffee and tea) by developments in nanotechnology. These natural products are important export crops for developing countries, and many farmers' livelihoods depend on them. It has been argued that their substitution with industrial nano-products could negatively impact the economies of developing countries, that have traditionally relied on these export crops.\nIt is proposed that nanotechnology can only be effective in alleviating poverty and aid development \"when adapted to social, cultural and local institutional contexts, and chosen and designed with the active participation by citizens right from the commencement point\" (Invernizzi et al. 2008, p. 132)."], "wikipedia-29621505": ["Furthermore, there are implications of the people accounting hypothesis toward the affirmative action policy discussion.

While some argue that globalization is beneficial, it is also claimed that not everyone is benefiting from globalization equally. In particular, females often do not benefit to the extent of their male counterparts. Contemporary globalizing forces such as the World Bank and the United Nations have worked to deconstruct the barriers of inequality and existing gender gaps. As a result, this article is focused on the 21st century economic transformation that has emerged through globalization as it has impacted not only global markets, but also, the overall landscape at an individual level. At the same time, there is a need to present the various struggles and existing realities of gender inequality in America\u2019s workforce, which still finds itself on the path towards full equality.\n\nGlobalization has brought increased access to economic opportunities. Most of these opportunities have come as a result of trade openness and the spread of information and communication technologies (ICTs). This has led to an increase in women's access to economic opportunities and in some cases increased their wages relative to men's. More specifically, the World Bank claims, \u201ctrade openness and the diffusion of new information and technologies have translated into more jobs and stronger connections to markets for many women\u201d. Increased access to information, primarily through television and the Internet, allows the general American public to learn about social mores in other places, which can change perceptions and promote the establishment of egalitarian attitudes. Instead, egalitarian attitudes are currently hindered by the existing reality of woman making up the majority of the low-wage workforce industry. More specifically, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), in a recent report shows that \u201cin 2010, women constituted 59 percent of the low-wage workforce\u201d.\n\nGlobalizing organizations and institutions such as the United Nations, and the World Bank have worked to promote gender equality. The task has not been easy given the need to undo many institutionalized and systemic influences on gender equality. Thus, the ability to override these forms of oppression stems from spreading awareness. Globalizing institutions have used increased awareness to shed light issues of gender inequality, particularly in the work force. For example, \u201cThe Beijing + 5 process provides an opportunity to reflect on the impact of Globalization in determining further actions and initiatives for the full implementation of the Beijing commitments\u201d. Furthermore, the ability to promote awareness is by default facilitated because, for example, in the nonagricultural sector, the total share percentage of women employed is at 48% from a 2012 report. Thus, when the gender binaries of male and female in the U.S. constitute half of the entire workforce respectively, the females that receive unequal treatment have the ability to speak out against the cause with the understanding that a high proportion of the public backs them.\n\nPublic opinion in the USA on Globalization and its impacts on gender inequality has been shaped by denial of basic human rights in the workforce abroad. The World Bank states that \u201cPublic opinion in developed countries generally connects globalization with sweatshops where child labor is common and workers are denied the most basic rights\u201d. Similarly, the issue of sweatshops is acute in the informal sector. For example, the arrangements such as sub-contracting and outsourcing have become an integral part of the contemporary market economy. Thus, issues of unfair pay and poor working environments are commonly interpreted as issues abroad. However, there remains high contestation against transnationals that allow these issues to happen in the first place through the act of shifting their manufacturing bases away from the U.S. and into other countries with lenient regulations and restrictions.\n\nGlobalization's impact on gender inequality has also had its fair share of benefits in the U.S. to the extent that the \u201cdemand for female workers in the export and ICT-enabled sectors has increased, and as women have filled these new jobs\u201d. The U.S. has been on the forefront of the technological advancements around the world. As a result, the ICT industry impacts and reflects both a benefit, and a hindrance to gender inequality. This is mostly due to the reality that forces of globalization are real and their influences are felt everywhere. More specifically, the Inter-agency network on women and gender equality by the United Nations claims, \u201cEquitable access to information and Communication technologies can be an important tool for empowering women.\u201d ICT can empower women through increasing their activity, as well as help reduce gender inequalities by \u201creducing women\u2019s and girls\u2019 time demands, increasing their access to income-generating activities, and allowing them to benefit from technological advances\u201d. However, it is also argued that ICT sectors have not necessarily helped women. Instead, \u201cwomen are under-represented in ICT decision making structures including policy and regulatory institutions\u201d. Thus, the workforce continues to fluctuate between becoming increasingly viewed as supportive of gender equality as well as the belief that it has promoted precisely the opposite.\n\nWhile there is a strong concentration around the role of women, they are the ones that mostly suffer from gender inequality. However, there are also masculine organizations that also promote the need to fix the issue of gender inequality. There is an existing belief that \u201cMen and boys are thus, in several ways, gatekeepers for gender equality and should be targeted and included in efforts to promote gender equality so as to ensure men\u2019s support and partnership\u201d. It is only through a collective effort that gender equality can flourish. However, it should be noted that the reality of gender inequality in the U.S. is one where men also \u201cface vulnerabilities because of gender inequality, such as experiencing stress from being regarded, and regarding themselves, as the main breadwinner\u201d. Moreover, failing to get a job, or losing their job and the inability to earn enough money can also lead to an erosion of their self-worth as men.\n\nThere are various studies available that depict globalization as a hindrance toward gender inequality. For example, shortly before the transition into the 21st century, \u201crecent studies such as UNCTAD\u2019s Trade and Development Report (1997) and the UNDP\u2019s Human Development Reports (1997 and 1999) suggest that economic growth fostered by recent liberalization policies can be accompanied by increased inequality and a decline in living standards\". However, on the other hand, positive effects may include \u201cincreased employment opportunities for women in non-traditional sectors\u201d thus enabling them to earn and control income\" \n\nWhile the USA serves as one of the key players in the international system that is not to say that it is immune to the gender pay gaps that exist around the world. In fact, the great recession and financial crisis of 2007-2008 demonstrates the reality of these inequalities given that men and women were affected differently. Statistically, in the U.S. alone, men lost more jobs than women in the recession. But at the same time, men also experienced a steadier recovery. \u201cOne in five women are working part time because they cannot find full time work while at the start of the recession less than one in ten women were doing so\u201d. Despite these developments, the overall unemployment rate for women is lower than men\u2019s and they are also less likely to be among the long-term unemployed.\n\n21st century globalization and its impact on gender equality remains highly influenced by the past. The World Bank openly admitted to the influence of the past by claiming, \u201ceven among those who have benefited from higher access to economic opportunities, old patterns of employment segregation by gender can emerge\u201d. Furthermore, the ability to undermine these old patterns is by continually raising awareness. The ability to raise awareness and counter old patterns is prominent in the U.S. and visible through globalizing organization-sponsored groups. One important group that has worked to raise awareness is known as WomenWatch, a United Nations inter-agency website on gender equality reducing women\u2019s and girls\u2019 time demands, increasing their access to income-generating activities, and allowing them to benefit from technological advances\u201d. Their mission is essentially to shed light to the various ways gender equality can become a reality if everyone\u2019s concerns converge and coalesce.\n\nGlobalization on its own cannot end gender inequality. There should be an understanding that the Globalization process as a whole offers both opportunities, as well as challenges for human development. Consequently, a collective effort implies an understanding that \u201cthe specific gender-related needs of men are overlooked, as well as the important role that men can play in achieving gender equality and empowering women\u201d. It is precisely through understanding the dynamics of gender inequality while incorporating both males and females into the playing field that equality can ultimately be achieved."], "wikipedia-29864197": ["Housing inequality is directly related to racial, social, income and wealth inequality. It is often the result of market forces, discrimination and segregation.\nIt is also a cause and an effect of poverty. Residential inequality is especially relevant when considering Amartya Sen\u2019s definition of poverty as \"the deprivation of core capabilities\".\n\nDisparities in housing explain variations in the conversion of income into human capabilities in different social climates. Income does not always translate into desirable outcomes such as healthcare, education, and housing quality is a factor which determines if those outcomes are readily available to an individual. According to economist and philosopher Amartya Sen, an individual's freedoms (or capabilities) are significant indicators of the kind of life they value or have a reason to value. As economic equality varies by economic system, historical period and society, so does housing inequality.\n\nEconomic inequality is a primary contributing factor to housing inequality. The distribution of wealth in a region affects who has access to housing, and at what level.\n\nSocial inequality is the difference in access to social goods brought about by social constructs such as power, religion, kinship, prestige, race, ethnicity, gender, age, and class. Social goods include the labor market, a source of income, healthcare, freedom of speech, education and political representation and participation. Social inequality may be a factor of housing inequality, as when individuals are denied access to housing based on social characteristics. Conversely, social inequality can be a result of housing inequality (such as social stigma associated with living in a certain neighborhood or type of home).\n\nThe most direct effect of housing inequality is an inequality of neighborhood amenities, which include the condition of surrounding houses, the availability of social networks, the amount of air pollution, the crime rate, and the quality of local schools. A neighborhood with a certain quality of amenities typically includes individual residences of corresponding quality. Those with lower incomes usually live in areas with poor amenities to win the spatial competition for housing. A neighborhood amenity includes satisfaction derived from living in a nice area, and many studies suggest that growing up in a high-poverty neighborhood affects social and economic outcomes later in life. \nAnother way the poor compete for housing is by renting homes rather than buying them, which furthers the negative effects of housing inequality by restricting access to household wealth.\n\nProposals to remedy the adverse effects of housing inequality include:\nBULLET::::- Subsidized housing, also known as affordable housing.

Such insights can inform dynamic interventions to counteract undesirable procrastination behavior.

This vision requires approaching learning analytics research and applications through a few different perspectives, such as algorithmic fairness [ 4, 23], value-sensitive and human-centered design [7, 10], and critical theories [45]. The foundation of these inquiries is that the identities of individual students involved are known, so that researchers or practitioners can observe the unique experience of vulnerable and marginalized student populations, which might differ from that of their majority counterparts and be masked in population-level analyses.

It manifests itself in a variety of ways: among students, blacks and Hispanics are more likely to receive lower grades, score lower on standardized tests, drop out of high school, and they are less likely to enter and complete college than whites, while whites score lower than Asian Americans.\n\nEvidence of the racial achievement gaps have been manifested through standardized test scores, high school dropout rates, high school completion rates, college acceptance and retention rates, as well as through longitudinal trends.", "The Hispanic White Gap demonstrates:\nBULLET::::- In mathematics, a 21-point difference at the 4th grade level and a 26-point difference at the 8th grade level.\nBULLET::::- In reading, there is a 25-point difference at the 4th grade level and a 24-point difference at the 8th grade level (NAEP, 2011).\nThe National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS, 1988) demonstrates similar findings in their evaluation of assessments administered to 12th graders in reading and math.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:Standardized test scores.:Mathematics.\nResults of the mathematics achievement test:\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:Standardized test scores.:Reading.\nResults of the reading achievement test:\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:High school dropout rates.\nAccording to the US Department of Education, event dropout rate is the percentage of high school students who dropped out of high school between the beginning of one school year and the beginning of the next school year. Five out of every 100 students enrolled in high school in October 2000 left school before October 2001 without successfully completing a high school program. The percentage of students who were event dropouts decreased from 1972 through 1987. However, despite some year-to-year fluctuations, the percentage of students dropping out of school each year has stayed relatively the same since 1987. Data from the October 2001 Current Population Survey (CPS) show that black and Hispanic students were more likely to have dropped out of high school between October 2000 and October 2001 than were white or Asians/Pacific Islander students. During this period, 6.3% of black and 8.8% of Hispanic high school students dropped out compared to 4.1% of white and 2.3% of Asian/Pacific Islander high school students.\nAccording to the US Department of Education, status dropout rates measure the percentage of individuals who are not enrolled in high school and who lack a high school credential, independent of when they dropped out. Status rates are higher than event rates because they include all dropouts in this age range, regardless of when they last attended school or whether or not they ever entered the US education system. In October 2001, about 3.8 million 16- through 24-year-olds were not enrolled in a high school program and had not completed high school. These individuals accounted for 10.7% of the 35.2 million 16- through 24-year-olds in the United States in 2001. In 1972, the white status dropout rate was 40% and the black status dropout rate was 49%. Because the black rate declined more steeply than the white rate, there has been a narrowing of the gap between the dropout rates for blacks and whites. However, this narrowing occurred in the 1980s, and the gap between whites and blacks has remained fairly constant since 1990. The percentage of Hispanics who were status dropouts has remained higher than that of blacks and whites in every year since 1970. Even though Hispanics represented approximately the same percentage of the young adult population as did blacks, Hispanics were disproportionately represented among status dropouts in 2001. Also in 2001, the status dropout rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders ages 16\u201324 was lower than for any other 16- through 24-year-olds. Specifically, the status rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders was 3.6%, compared with 27.0% for Hispanics, 20.9% for blacks, and 7.3% for whites.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:High school completion rates.\nStatus completion rates measure the percentage of a given population that has a high school credential, regardless of when the credential was earned. In 2001, 86.5% of 18- through 24-year-olds not enrolled in elementary or secondary school had completed high school. Status completion rates increased from 82.8% in 1972 to 85.6% in 1990. Since 1991, the rate has shown no consistent trend and has fluctuated between 84.8% and 86.5%. High school status completion rates for white and black young adults increased between the early 1970s and 1990 but has remained relatively the same since 1990. Specifically, status completion rates for white students increased from 86.0% in 1972 to 89.6% in 1990. Since 1990, white completion rates have remained in the range of 89.4\u201391.8%. In 2001, 91.0% of white and 85.6% of black 18- through 24-year-olds had completed high school. The percentage of black students completing high school rose from 72.1% in 1972 to 85.6% in 2001. The gap between black and white completion rates narrowed between 1972 and 2001. In 2001, 65.7% of all Hispanic 18- through 24-year-olds completed high school. This percentage compares to 91.0% of whites, 85.6% of blacks, and 96.1% of Asians/Pacific Islanders. Essentially, in 2001, whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders were more likely than their black and Hispanic peers to have completed high school. Also, whites completed high school at a higher rate than both blacks and Hispanic students. Black students completed high school at a higher rate than Hispanics.\nThe four-year completion rate is the percentage of 9th-grade students who left school over a subsequent 4-year period while also completing a high school credential. Data for the 4-year completion rate calculations are taken from the Common Core of Data (CCD). The 4-year completion rate calculation is dependent on the availability of dropout estimates over a 4-year span, and current counts of completers. Because dropout rate information was missing for many states during the 4-year period considered by the US Department of Education, 4- year completion rate estimates for the 2000-01 school year are only available for 39 states. Since data were not available from all states, an overall national rate could not be calculated. However, among reporting states, the high school 4-year completion rates for public school students ranged from a high of 90.1% in North Dakota to a low of 65.0% in Louisiana.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:SAT scores.\nRacial and ethnic variations in SAT scores follow a similar pattern to other racial achievement gaps. In 1990, the average SAT was 528 for Asian-Americans, 491 for whites, 429 for Mexican Americans and 385 for blacks. 34% of Asians compared with 20% of whites, 3% of blacks, 7% of Mexican Americans, and 9% of Native Americans scored above a 600 on the SAT math section. On the SAT verbal section in 1990, whites scored an average of 442, compared with 410 for Asians, 352 for blacks, 380 for Mexican Americans, and 388 for Native Americans. \nIn 2015, the average SAT scores on the math section were 598 for Asian-Americans, 534 for whites, 457 for Hispanic Latinos and 428 for blacks. \nAdditionally, 10% of Asian-Americans, 8% of whites, 3% of Mexican Americans, 3% of Native Americans and 2% of blacks scored above 600 on the SAT verbal section in 1990.\nRace gaps on the SATs are especially pronounced at the tails of the distribution. In a perfectly equal distribution, the racial breakdown of scores at every point in the distribution should ideally mirror the demographic composition of test-takers as whole i.e. 51% whites, 21% Hispanic Latinos, 14% blacks, and 14% Asian-Americans. But ironically, among the highest top scorers, those scoring between a 750 and 800 (perfect scores) over 60% are East Asians of Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean and Han Chinese descent, while only 33% are white, compared to 5% Hispanic Latinos and 2% blacks.\nThere are some limitations to the data which may mean that, if anything, the race gap is being understated. The ceiling on the SAT score may, for example, understate the achievement and full potential of East Asians of Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean and Han Chinese descent. If the exam was redesigned to increase score variance (add harder and easier questions than it currently has), the achievement gap across racial groups could be even more wider and pronounced. In other words, if the math section was scored between 0 and 1000, we might see more complete tails on both the right and the left. More East Asians score between 750 and 800 than score between 700 and 750, suggesting that many East Asians of Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean and Han Chinese descent could be scoring high above 800 if the test allowed them to.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:College enrollment and graduation rates.\nThe US Department in Education demonstrates performance of different ethnic groups in colleges and universities. Specifically, they found that about 72% of White students who have completed high school enrolled in college the same year, compared to 44% for Black students, and 50% for Hispanic students. Furthermore, trends in undergraduate and graduate enrollment have shown increases in all ethnicity groups, but the largest gap still exists for Black student enrollment. Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islanders student enrollment have experienced the most growth since 1976. The 6-year national college graduation rate is 59% for White students, 51% for Hispanic students, 46% for Black females, and 35% for Black males. Furthermore, even at prestigious institutions, the graduation rate of white students is higher than that of black student.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:Long-term trends.\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has been testing seventeen-year-olds since 1971. From 1971 to 1996, the black-white reading gap shrank by almost one half and the math gap by almost one third. Specifically, blacks scored an average of 239 points, and whites scored an average of 291 points on the NAEP reading tests in 1971. In 1990, blacks scored an average of 267", "On NAEP math tests in 1973, blacks scored an average of 270, and whites scored 310. In 1990, black average score was 289 and whites scored an average of 310 points. For Hispanics, the average NAEP math score for seventeen-year-olds in 1973 was 277 and 310 for whites. In 1990, the average score among Hispanics was 284 compared with 310 for whites.\nThe Black-White Gap demonstrates:\nBULLET::::- In mathematics, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 14 points from 1973 to 2008.\nBULLET::::- In reading, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 24 points from 1971 to 2008.\nThe Hispanic-White Gap demonstrates:\nBULLET::::- In mathematics, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 12 points from 1973 to 2008.\nBULLET::::- In reading, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 15 points from 1975 to 2008.\nFurthermore, subgroups showed predominant gains in 4th grade at all achievement levels. In terms of achieving proficiency, gaps between subgroups in most states have narrowed across grade levels, yet had widened in 23% of instances. The progress made in elementary and middle schools was greater than that in high schools, which demonstrates the importance of early childhood education.", "The quality of language that the student uses is affected by family's socioeconomic backgrounds, which is another factor in the academic achievement gap.\nWhites from families with incomes below $10,000 had a mean SAT test score that was 61 points higher than blacks whose families had incomes of between $80,000 and $100,000.", "Psychologists Claude Steele, Joshua Aronson, and Steven Spencer, have found that Microaggression such as passing reminders that someone belongs to one group or another (i.e.: a group stereotyped as inferior in academics) can affect test performance.\nSteele tested the stereotype threat theory by giving Black and White college students a half-hour test using difficult questions from the verbal Graduate Record Examination (GRE). In the stereotype-threat condition, they told students the test diagnosed intellectual ability. In saying that the test diagnoses intellectual ability it can potentially elicit the stereotype that Blacks are less intelligent than Whites. In the no-stereotype-threat condition, they told students that the test was a problem-solving lab task that said nothing about ability. This made stereotypes irrelevant. In the stereotype threat condition, Blacks who were evenly matched with Whites in their group by SAT scores, performed worse compared to their White counterparts. In the experiments with no stereotype threat, Blacks performed slightly better than in those with a stereotype threat, though still significantly worse than whites. Aronson believes the study of stereotype threat offers some \"exciting and encouraging answers to these old questions [of achievement gaps] by looking at the psychology of stigma -- the way human beings respond to negative stereotypes about their racial or gender group\". When pressed, Steele, Aronson, and Spenser, acknowledge that their experiments on stereotype threat only explain a modest portion of test-score gaps. However, their findings have consistently been erroneously attributed to explaining the entirety of the test score gap.", "The No Child Left Behind Act(NCLB) legislation was signed by President Bush in January 2002 and dramatically expanded federal influence over the nation's more than 90,000 public schools. The main implications of this legislation was states had to conduct annual student assessments linked to state standards to identify schools failing to make \"adequate yearly progress\" (AYP) toward the stated goal of having all students achieve proficiency in reading and math by 2013\u20132014 and to institute sanctions and rewards based on each school's AYP status.\n\nNCLB has shown mixed success in eliminating the racial achievement gap. Although test scores are improving, they are improving equally for all races, which means that minority students are still behind whites.\n\nA disparity between achievement gaps in private and public schools can be seen using a U.S. Department of Education database to compute the average National Assessment of Educational Progress test score differences between black students and white students in both public and private schools.\nThe table on White/Black NAEP Achievement Differences for Public and Private Schools above, shows a sizeable achievement gap between black and white fourth-graders in both public and private schools. However, the private-sector achievement gap is narrower in the 12th grade than the fourth grade for all of the core NAEP subjects. Public schools, on the other hand, see a larger gap in both writing and mathematics at the 12th-grade level than at the fourth. Averaged across subjects, the public school racial achievement gap is virtually unchanged between fourth and 12th grades, while the gap in private schools is an average of 27.5 percentage points smaller in the 12th grade than the fourth."], "wikipedia-1040219": ["The achievement gap can be observed on a variety of measures, including standardized test scores, grade point average, dropout rates, and college enrollment and completion rates.", "Disadvantages in a child's early life can cultivate into achievement gaps in their education. Poverty, coupled with the environment they are raised in, can lead to shortcomings in educational achievement. Despite strong standards and beliefs in education, Hispanic children consistently perform poorly, reflected by a low average of math and reading scores, as compared to other groups except African American. Hispanic and African American children have been shown to be more likely to be raised in poverty, with 33% of Hispanic families living below the economic poverty level, compared to African American (39%), Asian (14%) and White (13%) counterparts.", "Sociologists Christopher Jencks and Meredith Phillips have argued that narrowing the black-white test score gap \"would do more to move [the United States] toward racial equality than any politically plausible alternative\".\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics, it noted that African American 12th grade male students had the lowest reading scores among other racial and ethnic group. Reading gaps between African Americans and Whites have increased from 1992 to present (National Center for Education Statistics, 2016).\nHigh performing Black schools are not unique to the twentieth century. In Washington, DC in the late 19th century, a predominantly low income Black school performed higher than three White schools in yearly testing. This trend continued until the mid 20th century, and during that time the M Street School exceeded national norms on standardized tests.", "Section::::Racial achievement gap.:High school graduation.\n\"Completed High School age 25-29 (1998)\"\nUS Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans age 25 to 29 had completed high school, lagging only slightly behind 93 percent for whites. For all over the age of 25, clear majorities of whites, Asian Americans and African Americans had graduated at 88 percent, 85 percent and 77 percent, respectively. 56 percent, or barely over half of Hispanics 25 and over, had completed high school.\nSection::::Racial achievement gap.:Income and class.\nSAT scores vs income and race\nSource: 1995 College Board SAT Profiles\nConservative African American scholars such as Thomas Sowell observe that while SAT scores are lower for students with less parental education and income. Asian Americans who took the SAT with incomes below $10,000 score 482 in math in 1995, comparable to whites earning $30\u201340,000 and higher and blacks over $70,000. Test scores in middle-income black communities, such as Prince George County, are still not comparable to those in non-black suburbs.\nSection::::Racial achievement gap.:State standards.\nMost state tests showing African American failure rates anywhere from two to four times the rate of whites, such as Washington State's WASL test, and only half to one-quarter as likely to achieve a high score, even though these tests were designed to eliminate the negative effects of bias associated with standardized multiple choice tests. It is a top goal of education reform to eliminate the \"Education gap\" between all races, though skeptics question whether legislation such as No Child Left Behind truly closes the gap just by raising expectations. Others, such as Alfie Kohn, observe it may merely penalize those who do not score as well as the most educated ethnic and income groups.\nSection::::Racial achievement gap.:Special programs.\nAchievement gaps among students may also manifest themselves in the racial and ethnic composition of special education and gifted education programs. Typically, African American and Hispanic students are enrolled in greater numbers in special education programs than their numbers would indicate in most populations, while these groups are underrepresented in gifted programs. Research shows that these disproportionate enrollment trends may be a consequence of the differences in educational achievement among groups.", "Gender gap in literacy.\nTraditionally, girls have outperformed boys in reading and writing. Although this gap may be minimal in kindergarten, it grows as students continue their education. According to the 2004 National Reading Assessment measured by the US Department of Education, the gap between boys and girls, only slightly noticeable in 4th grade, left boys 14 points behind girls during their 12th grade year. On the 2008 test, female students continued to have higher average reading scores than male students at all three ages. The gap between male and female 4th graders was 7 points in 2008. By 12th grade, there was an 11-point gap between males and females.\nOn the 2002 National Writing Assessment, boys scored on average 17 points lower than girls in 4th grade. The average gap increased to 21 points by 8th grade and widened to 24 points by senior year in high school.

Five out of every 100 students enrolled in high school in October 2000 left school before October 2001 without successfully completing a high school program. The percentage of students who were event dropouts decreased from 1972 through 1987. However, despite some year-to-year fluctuations, the percentage of students dropping out of school each year has stayed relatively the same since 1987. Data from the October 2001 Current Population Survey (CPS) show that black and Hispanic students were more likely to have dropped out of high school between October 2000 and October 2001 than were white or Asians/Pacific Islander students. During this period, 6.3% of black and 8.8% of Hispanic high school students dropped out compared to 4.1% of white and 2.3% of Asian/Pacific Islander high school students.\nAccording to the US Department of Education, status dropout rates measure the percentage of individuals who are not enrolled in high school and who lack a high school credential, independent of when they dropped out. Status rates are higher than event rates because they include all dropouts in this age range, regardless of when they last attended school or whether or not they ever entered the US education system. In October 2001, about 3.8 million 16- through 24-year-olds were not enrolled in a high school program and had not completed high school. These individuals accounted for 10.7% of the 35.2 million 16- through 24-year-olds in the United States in 2001. In 1972, the white status dropout rate was 40% and the black status dropout rate was 49%. Because the black rate declined more steeply than the white rate, there has been a narrowing of the gap between the dropout rates for blacks and whites. However, this narrowing occurred in the 1980s, and the gap between whites and blacks has remained fairly constant since 1990. The percentage of Hispanics who were status dropouts has remained higher than that of blacks and whites in every year since 1970. Even though Hispanics represented approximately the same percentage of the young adult population as did blacks, Hispanics were disproportionately represented among status dropouts in 2001. Also in 2001, the status dropout rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders ages 16\u201324 was lower than for any other 16- through 24-year-olds. Specifically, the status rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders was 3.6%, compared with 27.0% for Hispanics, 20.9% for blacks, and 7.3% for whites.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:High school completion rates.\nStatus completion rates measure the percentage of a given population that has a high school credential, regardless of when the credential was earned. In 2001, 86.5% of 18- through 24-year-olds not enrolled in elementary or secondary school had completed high school. Status completion rates increased from 82.8% in 1972 to 85.6% in 1990. Since 1991, the rate has shown no consistent trend and has fluctuated between 84.8% and 86.5%. High school status completion rates for white and black young adults increased between the early 1970s and 1990 but has remained relatively the same since 1990. Specifically, status completion rates for white students increased from 86.0% in 1972 to 89.6% in 1990. Since 1990, white completion rates have remained in the range of 89.4\u201391.8%. In 2001, 91.0% of white and 85.6% of black 18- through 24-year-olds had completed high school. The percentage of black students completing high school rose from 72.1% in 1972 to 85.6% in 2001. The gap between black and white completion rates narrowed between 1972 and 2001. In 2001, 65.7% of all Hispanic 18- through 24-year- olds completed high school. This percentage compares to 91.0% of whites, 85.6% of blacks, and 96.1% of Asians/Pacific Islanders. Essentially, in 2001, whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders were more likely than their black and Hispanic peers to have completed high school. Also, whites completed high school at a higher rate than both blacks and Hispanic students. Black students completed high school at a higher rate than Hispanics.\nThe four-year completion rate is the percentage of 9th-grade students who left school over a subsequent 4-year period while also completing a high school credential. Data for the 4-year completion rate calculations are taken from the Common Core of Data (CCD). The 4-year completion rate calculation is dependent on the availability of dropout estimates over a 4-year span, and current counts of completers. Because dropout rate information was missing for many states during the 4-year period considered by the US Department of Education, 4- year completion rate estimates for the 2000-01 school year are only available for 39 states. Since data were not available from all states, an overall national rate could not be calculated. However, among reporting states, the high school 4-year completion rates for public school students ranged from a high of 90.1% in North Dakota to a low of 65.0% in Louisiana.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:SAT scores.\nRacial and ethnic variations in SAT scores follow a similar pattern to other racial achievement gaps. In 1990, the average SAT was 528 for Asian-Americans, 491 for whites, 429 for Mexican Americans and 385 for blacks. 34% of Asians compared with 20% of whites, 3% of blacks, 7% of Mexican Americans, and 9% of Native Americans scored above a 600 on the SAT math section. On the SAT verbal section in 1990, whites scored an average of 442, compared with 410 for Asians, 352 for blacks, 380 for Mexican Americans, and 388 for Native Americans. \nIn 2015, the average SAT scores on the math section were 598 for Asian-Americans, 534 for whites, 457 for Hispanic Latinos and 428 for blacks. \nAdditionally, 10% of Asian-Americans, 8% of whites, 3% of Mexican Americans, 3% of Native Americans and 2% of blacks scored above 600 on the SAT verbal section in 1990.\nRace gaps on the SATs are especially pronounced at the tails of the distribution. In a perfectly equal distribution, the racial breakdown of scores at every point in the distribution should ideally mirror the demographic composition of test-takers as whole i.e. 51% whites, 21% Hispanic Latinos, 14% blacks, and 14% Asian-Americans. But ironically, among the highest top scorers, those scoring between a 750 and 800 (perfect scores) over 60% are East Asians of Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean and Han Chinese descent, while only 33% are white, compared to 5% Hispanic Latinos and 2% blacks.\nThere are some limitations to the data which may mean that, if anything, the race gap is being understated. The ceiling on the SAT score may, for example, understate the achievement and full potential of East Asians of Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean and Han Chinese descent. If the exam was redesigned to increase score variance (add harder and easier questions than it currently has), the achievement gap across racial groups could be even more wider and pronounced. In other words, if the math section was scored between 0 and 1000, we might see more complete tails on both the right and the left. More East Asians score between 750 and 800 than score between 700 and 750, suggesting that many East Asians of Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean and Han Chinese descent could be scoring high above 800 if the test allowed them to.\nSection::::Evidence of the racial achievement gap.:College enrollment and graduation rates.\nThe US Department in Education demonstrates performance of different ethnic groups in colleges and universities. Specifically, they found that about 72% of White students who have completed high school enrolled in college the same year, compared to 44% for Black students, and 50% for Hispanic students. Furthermore, trends in undergraduate and graduate enrollment have shown increases in all ethnicity groups, but the largest gap still exists for Black student enrollment. Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islanders student enrollment have experienced the most growth since 1976. The 6-year national college graduation rate is 59% for White students, 51% for Hispanic students, 46% for...", "The NAEP has since collected and analyzed data through 2008. Overall, the White-Hispanic and the White-Black gap for NAEP scores have significantly decreased since the 1970s.\nThe Black-White Gap demonstrates:\nBULLET::::- In mathematics, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 14 points from 1973 to 2008.\nBULLET::::- In reading, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 24 points from 1971 to 2008.\nThe Hispanic-White Gap demonstrates:\nBULLET::::- In mathematics, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 12 points from 1973 to 2008.\nBULLET::::- In reading, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 15 points from 1975 to 2008.", "For example, children from poor families have lower academic performance in kindergarten than children from middle to upper-class backgrounds, but children from poor families who had cognitively stimulating materials in the home demonstrated higher rates of academic achievement in kindergarten. Additionally, parents of children living in poverty are less likely to have cognitively stimulating materials in the home for their children and are less likely to be involved in their child's school. The quality of language that the student uses is affected by family's socioeconomic backgrounds, which is another factor in the academic achievement gap.\nIn the United States, most minority groups are more likely to live in poverty than White Americans. Unemployment rate and mortgages for African and Latin Americans are usually higher than White Americans'. And although Asian American families earn, on average, more income than White American families do, there are usually more family members working in the Asian American family than the White American family. These disparities in socioeconomic status between minority groups and White Americans help explain differences in parenting styles, family structure, and the resultant educational achievement of minority children. However, the racial gaps persists when comparing families with similar income. Whites from families with incomes below $10,000 had a mean SAT test score that was 61 points higher than blacks whose families had incomes of between $80,000 and $100,000.", "Differences in the academic performance of African-American and White students exist even in schools that are desegregated and diverse, and studies have shown that a school's racial mix does not seem to have much effect on changes in reading scores after sixth grade, or on math scores at any age. In fact, minority students in segregated-minority schools have more optimism and greater educational aspirations as well as achievements than minority students in segregated-white schools. This can be attributed to various factors, including the attitudes of faculty and staff at segregated-white schools and the effect of stereotype threat.", "The stereotype threat both perpetuates and is caused by the achievement gap. Furthermore, students of low academic performance demonstrate low expectations for themselves and self-handicapping tendencies. Psychologists Claude Steele, Joshua Aronson, and Steven Spencer, have found that Microaggression such as passing reminders that someone belongs to one group or another (i.e.: a group stereotyped as inferior in academics) can affect test performance.", "NCLB has shown mixed success in eliminating the racial achievement gap. Although test scores are improving, they are improving equally for all races, which means that minority students are still behind whites. There has also been some criticism as to whether an increase in test scores actually corresponds to improvements in education, since test standards vary from state to state and from year to year."], "wikipedia-1040219": ["The achievement gap can be observed on a variety of measures, including standardized test scores, grade point average, dropout rates, and college enrollment and completion rates.", "Hispanic children consistently perform poorly, reflected by a low average of math and reading scores, as compared to other groups except African American.

Children who are raised in poverty are less likely to be enrolled in nursery or preschool. Though researchers are seeing improvements in achievement levels, such as a decrease in high school dropout rates (from 24% to 17%) and a steady increase in math and reading scores over the past 10 years, there are still issues that must be addressed.", "According to National Center for Education Statistics, it noted that African American 12th grade male students had the lowest reading scores among other racial and ethnic group.

It is a top goal of education reform to eliminate the \"Education gap\" between all races, though skeptics question whether legislation such as No Child Left Behind truly closes the gap just by raising expectations.

On the 2008 test, female students continued to have higher average reading scores than male students at all three ages. The gap between male and female 4th graders was 7 points in 2008.

A good approach is to creatively utilize one's internal circadian rhythms that are best suited for the most challenging and productive work. Steel states that it is essential to have realistic goals, to tackle one problem at a time and to cherish the \"small successes\"."], "wikipedia-1040161": ["According to the social constructivist approach, instructors have to adapt to the role of facilitators and not teachers. Whereas a teacher gives a didactic lecture that covers the subject matter, a facilitator helps the learner to get to his or her own understanding of the content. In the former scenario the learner plays a passive role and in the latter scenario the learner plays an active role in the learning process. The emphasis thus turns away from the instructor and the content, and towards the learner. This dramatic change of role implies that a facilitator needs to display a totally different set of skills than that of a teacher. A teacher tells, a facilitator asks; a teacher lectures from the front, a facilitator supports from the back; a teacher gives answers according to a set curriculum, a facilitator provides guidelines and creates the environment for the learner to arrive at his or her own conclusions; a teacher mostly gives a monologue, a facilitator is in continuous dialogue with the learners. A facilitator should also be able to adapt the learning experience 'in mid-air' by taking the initiative to steer the learning experience to where the learners want to create value.\n\nThe learning environment should also be designed to support and challenge the learner's thinking. While it is advocated to give the learner ownership of the problem and solution process, it is not the case that any activity or any solution is adequate. The critical goal is to support the learner in becoming an effective thinker. This can be achieved by assuming multiple roles, such as consultant and coach.\n\nA few strategies for cooperative learning include: \n- Reciprocal Questioning: students work together to ask and answer questions\n- Jigsaw Classroom: students become \"experts\" on one part of a group project and teach it to the others in their group\n- Structured Controversies: Students work together to research a particular controversy\n\nSome studies argue for the importance of mentoring in the process of learning.

These supports may include resource, compelling task, templates and guides, and/or guidance on the development of cognitive and social skills. Instructional scaffolding could be employed through modeling a task, giving advice, and/or providing coaching.\n\nThese supports are gradually removed as students develop learning strategies, thus promoting their own cognitive, affective and psychomotor learning skills and knowledge. Teachers help the students master a task or a concept by providing support. The support can take many forms such as outlines, recommended documents, storyboards, or key questions.\n\nFor scaffolding to be effective teachers need to pay attention to the following: \nBULLET::::1. The selection of the learning task: The task should ensure that learners use the developing skills that need to be mastered. The task should also be engaging and interesting to keep learners involved. Said task should be neither too difficult nor too hard for the learner.\nBULLET::::2. The anticipation of errors: After choosing the task, the teacher needs to anticipate errors the learners are likely to commit when working on the task. Anticipation of errors enables the scaffolder to properly guide the learners away from ineffective directions.\nBULLET::::3. The application of scaffolds during the learning task: Scaffolds could be organized in \"simple skill acquisition or they may be dynamic and generative\".\nBULLET::::4. The consideration of emotive or affective factors: Scaffolding is not limited to a cognitive skill but it also relates to emotive and affect factors. During the task the \"scaffolder\" (expert) might need to manage and control for frustration and loss of interest that could be experienced by the learner. Encouragement is also an important scaffolding strategy.", "Reciprocal scaffolding, a method first coined by Holton and Thomas, is a method that involves a group of two or more collaboratively working together. In this situation, the group can learn from each other's experiences and knowledge. The scaffolding is shared by each member and changes constantly as the group works on a task (Holton and Clarke, 2006). According to Vygotsky, students develop higher-level thinking skills when scaffolding occurs with an adult expert or with a peer of higher capabilities (Stone, 1998). Conversely, Piaget believes that students discard their ideas when paired with an adult or student of more expertise (Piaget, 1928). Instead, students should be paired with others who have different perspectives. Conflicts would then take place between students allowing them to think constructively at a higher level.\nTechnical scaffolding is a newer approach in which computers replace the teachers as the experts or guides, and students can be guided with web links, online tutorials, or help pages (Yelland and Masters, 2007). Educational software can help students follow a clear structure and allows students to plan properly (Lai and Law, 2006).\nSection::::Levels and types in the educational setting.:Directive and supportive scaffolding.\nSilliman and Wilkinson (1994) distinguish two types of scaffolding: 'supportive scaffolding' that characterises the IRF (Initiation-Response-Follow-up) pattern; and 'directive scaffolding' that refers to IRE (Initiation-Response-Evaluation). Saxena (2010) develops these two notions theoretically by incorporating Bhaktin's (1981) and vanLier's (1996) works. Within the IRE pattern, teachers provide 'directive scaffolding' on the assumption that their job is to transmit knowledge and then assess its appropriation by the learners. The question-answer-evaluation sequence creates a predetermined standard for acceptable participation and induces passive learning. In this type of interaction, the teacher holds the right to evaluate and asks 'known-information' questions which emphasise the reproduction of information. The nature and role of the triadic dialogue have been oversimplified and the potential for the roles of teachers and students in them has been undermined (Nassaji and Wells, 2000).\nIf, in managing the talk, teachers apply 'constructive power' (Saxena, 2009) and exploit students' responses as occasions for joint exploration, rather than simply evaluating them, then the classroom talk becomes dialogic (Nystrand, 1997). The pedagogic orientation of this talk becomes 'participation orientation', in contrast to 'display/assessment orientation' of IRE (van Lier, 1996). In this kind of pattern of interaction, the third part of the triadic dialogue offers 'follow-up' and teachers' scaffolding becomes 'supportive'. Rather than producing 'authoritative discourse' Bakhtin's (1981), teachers constructs 'internally persuasive discourse' that allows 'equality' and 'symmetry' (van Lier, 1996:175), wherein the issues of power, control, institutional managerial positioning, etc. are diffused or suspended. The discourse opens up the roles for students as the 'primary knower' and the 'sequence initiator' (Nassaji and Wells, 2000), which allows them to be the negotiator and co-constructor of meaning. The suspension of asymmetry in the talk represents a shift in the teacher's ideological stance and, therefore, demonstrates that supportive scaffolding is more than simply a model of instruction (Saxena, 2010: 167).\nSection::::The role of guidance.\nSection::::The role of guidance.:Guidance and cognitive load.\nLearner support in scaffolding is known as guidance. While it takes on various forms and styles, the basic form of guidance is any type of interaction from the instructor that is intended to aid and/or improve student learning. While this a broad definition, the role and amount of guidance is better defined by the instructor's approach. Instructionists and constructionists approach giving guidance within their own instructional frameworks. Scaffolding involves presenting learners with proper guidance that moves them towards their learning goals. Providing guidance is a method of moderating the cognitive load of a learner. In scaffolding, learners can only be moved toward their learning goals if cognitive load is held in check by properly administered support.\nInstructionists tend to give a higher level of guidance in light of the inquiry driven style of learning. With each piece of a complex task being broken down, instructors give guidance for each of the separated parts of the learning. In this way, higher guidance is a function of reducing cognitive load when students are working in a more individual manner.\nConstructivists approach guidance differently as a result of their focus on transfer. The concept of transfer focuses on a learner's ability to apply learned tasks in a context other than the modality in which it was learned. This results in constructivists giving a lower level of guidance, as learners work through a complete task, only being given guidance in transfer. The role of guidance is to ensure that cognitive load is moderated while the learner works at more complete and complex task; guidance is given during aspects of the task that will help enable transfer.\nSection::::The role of guidance.:Amount of guidance.\nResearch has demonstrated that higher level of guidance has a greater effect on scaffolded learning, but is not a guarantee of more learning. The efficacy of higher amount of guidance is dependent on the level of detail and guidance applicability. Having multiple types of guidance (i.e. worked examples, feedback) can cause them to interact and reinforce each other. Multiple conditions do not guarantee greater learning, as certain types of guidance can be extraneous to the learning goals or the modality of learning. With this, more guidance (if not appropriate to the learning) can negatively impact performance, as it gives the learner overwhelming levels of information. However, appropriately designed high levels of guidance, which properly interact with the learning, is more beneficial to learning than low levels of guidance.\nSection::::The role of guidance.:Context of guidance.\nConstructivists pay close attention to the context of guidance because they believe instruction plays a major role in knowledge retention and transfer. Research studies demonstrate how the context of isolated explanations can have an effect on student-learning outcomes. For example, Hake's (1998) large-scale study demonstrated how post-secondary physics students recalled less than 30% of material covered in a traditional lecture-style class. Similarly, other studies illustrate how students construct different understandings from explanation in isolation versus having a first experience with the material. A first, experience with the material provides students with a \"need to know\", which allows learners to reflect on prior experiences with the content, which can help learners construct meaning from instruction. Worked examples are guiding tools that can act as a \"need to know\" for students. Worked examples provide students with straightforward goals, step-by-step instructions as well as ready-to-solve problems that can help students develop a stronger understanding from instruction.\nSection::::The role of guidance.:Timing of guidance.\nGuiding has a key role both in constructivism and 'instructivism'. For instructivists, the timing of guidance is immediate, either at the beginning or when the learner makes a mistake, whereas in constructivism it can be delayed. It has been found that immediate feedback can lead to working memory load as it does not take in consideration the process of gradual acquisition of a skill, which also relates to the amount of guidance being given. Research on intelligent-tutoring systems suggests that immediate feedback on errors is a great strategy to promote learning. As the learner is able to integrate the feedback from short-term memory into the overall learning and problem solving task; the longer the wait on feedback, the harder it is for the learner to make this integration. Yet, in another study it was found that providing feedback right after the error can deprive the learner of the opportunity to develop evaluative skills. Wise and O'Neill bring these two, seemingly contradictory findings, and argue that it does not only prove the importance of the role of feedback, but that points out a timing feature of feedback: immediate feedback in the short term promotes more rapid problem solving, but delaying feedback can result in better retention and transfer in the long term.\nSection::::The role of guidance.:Constructivism and guidance.\nConstructivism views knowledge as a \"function of how the individual creates meaning from his or her own experiences\". Constructivists advocate that learning is better facilitated in a minimally guided environment where learners construct important information for themselves. According to constructivism, minimal guidance in the form of process or task related information should be provided to learners upon request and direct instruction of learning strategies should not be used because it impedes the natural processes learners use to recall prior experiences. \nIn this view, for learners to construct knowledge they should be provided with the goals and minimal information and support. Applications that promote constructivist learning require learners to solve authentic problems or \"acquire knowledge in information-rich settings\". An example of an application of constructivist learning is science instruction, where students are asked to discover the principles of science by imitating the steps and actions of researchers.", "In classrooms, scaffolding may include modelling behaviours, coaching and prompting, thinking out loud, dialogue with questions and answers, planned and spontaneous discussions, as well as other interactive planning or structural assistance to help the learner bridge a cognitive gap. This can also include peer mentoring from more experienced students. These peers can be referred to as MKOs. \"MKO\" stands for More Knowledgeable Other. The \"MKO\" is a person who is has a higher understanding of an idea or concept and can bridge this cognitive gap. This includes teachers, parents, and as stated before, peers. MKOs are central part of the process of learning in the ZPD, or Zone of Proximal Development. An MKO may help a student using scaffolding, with the goal being that the student can eventually lead themselves to the answer on their own, without the help of anyone else. The MKO may use a gradual reduction of assistance in order to facilitate this, as described earlier.\n\nThere are a wide variety of scaffolding strategies that teachers employ. One approach to looking at the application of scaffolding is to look at a framework for evaluating these strategies.\nThis model was developed based on the theoretical principles of scaffolding to highlight the use of scaffolding for educational purposes. It highlights two components of an instructors use of scaffolding. The first is the instructors intentions and the second refers to the means by which the scaffolding is carried out.\nScaffolding intentions:\nThese groups highlight the instructors intentions for scaffolding\nScaffolding means:\nThese groups highlight the ways in which the instructor scaffolds\nAny combination of scaffolding means with scaffolding intention can be construed as a scaffolding strategy, however, whether a teaching strategy qualifies as good scaffolding generally depends upon its enactment in actual practice and more specifically upon whether the strategy is applied contingently and whether it is also part of a process of fading and transfer of responsibility.\nExamples of scaffolding:\nInstructors can use a variety of scaffolds to accommodate different levels of knowledge. The context of learning (i.e. novice experience, complexity of the task) may require more than one scaffold strategy in order for the student to master new content. The following table outlines a few common scaffolding strategies:\n\nBULLET::::- conceptual scaffolding: helps students decide what to consider in learning and guide them to key concepts\nBULLET::::- procedural scaffolding: helps students use appropriate tools and resources effectively\nBULLET::::- strategic scaffolding: helps students find alternative strategies and methods to solve complex problems\nBULLET::::- metacognitive scaffolding: prompts students to think about what they are learning throughout the process and assists students reflecting on what they have learnt (self-assessment). This is the most common research area and is thought to not only promote higher order thinking but also students ability to plan ahead. Reingold, Rimor and Kalay have listed seven mechanisms of metacognitive scaffolding that encourage students' metacognition in learning.\n\nBULLET::::- scaffolding can help in group discussions. In a recent study, a significant increase in active participation and meaningful negotiations was found within the scaffolded groups as opposed to the non-scaffolded group.\nBULLET::::- metacognitive scaffolding can be used to encourage students in reflecting and help build a sense of a community among learners. Specifically, Reingold, Rimor and Kalay recommend using metacognitive scaffolding to support students working on a common task. They believe this can support learners to experience their work as part of a community of learners."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

We find that procrastination scores are normally distributed and centered around 0.5, but the distribution is shifted up for male students, first-generation college students, and especially URM students. This suggests that these groups of students exhibit more procrastination behavior on average compared to their peers.\nTo understand the magnitude of these differences, we plot the mean procrastination score for each subgroup on the same scale in Figure 3. A mean procrastination score of 0.5 indicates that, on average, students in this group tend to submit their assignments neither early nor late relative to others; for instance, in a class of 40 students, they tend to be the 20th person to submit.

Essentially, after a choice is made people tend to adjust their attitudes to be consistent with, the decision they have already made.\nMisattribution is a well-known commission error supported by researchers. It results in a type of choice-supportive bias when information is attributed to the wrong source. Consequently, the positive attributes of the forgone option are remembered as the positive attributes of the chosen option, or the negative attributes of the chosen option are remembered as the negative attributes of the foregone option.\nFact Distortion results in a type of choice-supportive bias when the facts belonging to the chosen option are remembered in a distorted manner. The distortion refers to the objective values and/or features of the chosen option being misremembered in a more preferential way to their actual values. Alternatively, the forgone option can be misremembered as being significantly less preferential then their actual values.\nSelective forgetting results in a form of choice-supportive bias when information is selectively forgotten. In this respect, the positive attributes of the chosen option and the negative attributes of the forgone option are retained in memory at a higher rate and the alternatives are displaced from memory at a faster rate.\nFalse Memory in the context of choice-supportive biases is when items that were not part of the original decision are remembered as being presented. If these entirely new items are positive, they will be remembered as belonging to the chosen option and if they are negative they will be remembered as belonging to the forgone option.", "One study looked at the accuracy and distortion in memory for high school grades. The relation between accuracy and distortion of autobiographical memory content was examined by verifying 3,220 high school grades recalled by 99 freshman college students. It was shown that most errors inflated the actual high school grade, meaning that these distortions are attributed to memory reconstructions in a positive and emotionally gratifying direction. In addition, their findings indicate that the process of distortion does not cause the actual unpleasant memory loss of getting the bad grade.

Such insights can inform dynamic interventions to counteract undesirable procrastination behavior. Second, using the same modeling approach, researchers can study within-individual variation (or stability) in procrastination behavior over time and across concurrent courses. Students sometimes procrastinate due to busy course schedules, new learning environments (e.g., first year of college), or other contextual factors. Students may also develop self-regulated learning skills throughout their college experience that reduce the chance of procrastination. In any case, tracking procrastination behavior at the individual level may shed light on students\u2019 educational contexts and development of study habits and help improve institutional policies to better support student success.

This pursuit of equity is motivated by long-standing disparities in educational access, experiences, and outcomes across students from different sociodemographic groups [ 17] resulting from systemic injustice in society. In learning analytics, centering equity advances the promise of challenging inequitable structures and improving the education system [ 41]. This vision requires approaching learning analytics research and applications through a few different perspectives, such as algorithmic fairness [ 4, 23], value-sensitive and human-centered design [7, 10], and critical theories [45]. The foundation of these inquiries is that the identities of individual students involved are known, so that researchers or practitioners can observe the unique experience of vulnerable and marginalized student populations, which might differ from that of their majority counterparts and be masked in population-level analyses. However, due to administrative constraints, privacy concerns, and other limitations, a large share of existing learning analytics research does not analyze students\u2019 sociodemographic characteristics [ 30, 43] and therefore runs the risk of misunderstanding students from underserved communities and reproducing existing inequities even with technically sound models.

Some of these strategies support the regulation of internal resources, such as effective ways of memorizing information. Others help regulate external resources, including setting goals, managing time, etc. Empirical studies have identified time management skills as a strong predictor of academic success [24, 46], and procrastination is often considered evidence that students struggle with time management [6].\nThe concept of procrastination originally means \u0142to defer intended action\u017e, which can occur for a variety of reasons. For some students, procrastination is a strategic delay in tasks to achieve positive outcomes [12]. These students tend to perform better under pressure and completing tasks closer to deadlines can create such an environment for them [11, 13]. However, the majority of modern research focuses on passive procrastination, i.e., delaying action when knowing that the delay will make them worse off [37]. Across a large body of empirical studies, this type of procrastination is mostly harmful, sometimes harmless, but never helpful for students\u2019 academic performance and wellbeing [6, 22, 37].\nPrior research has also identified a number of intrinsic and external factors that contribute to procrastination. Intrinsic factors include established psychological characteristics and personality traits, such as conscientiousness, distractibility, organization, achievement motivation, and the gap between one\u2019s intentions and actions [37]. While some of these intrinsic factors are stable traits across contexts (e.g., conscientiousness), others are malleable (e.g., organization skills, achievement motivation) and can therefore be affected by interventions. External factors include a diverse range of task attributes (e.g., the format and complexity of the task) and environmental attributes (e.g., distractions in the study environment) [38].

This encourages future research on how specific course and task characteristics affect this relationship, especially in small classes where this relationship varies the most and instructors have more flexibility in instructional design and policies. Such insights can inform dynamic interventions to counteract undesirable procrastination behavior. Second, using the same modeling approach, researchers can study within-individual variation (or stability) in procrastination behavior over time and across concurrent courses. Students sometimes procrastinate due to busy course schedules, new learning environments (e.g., first year of college), or other contextual factors. Students may also develop self-regulated learning skills throughout their college experience that reduce the chance of procrastination. In any case, tracking procrastination behavior at the individual level may shed light on students\u2019 educational contexts and development of study habits and help improve institutional policies to better support student success. Finally, this study exemplifies equity-oriented learning analytics research, which is a growing area of research [30, 41].

Given the multifaceted nature of procrastination established in psychological research [37], we acknowledge that any single behavioral measure can only capture certain aspects of procrastination, and that our approach might be a more scalable and convenient, but not necessarily more accurate, measure of procrastination. For example, even on the same platform, assignments have varying levels of importance, with some being frequent low-stakes quizzes attached to individual pieces of course material and others being high-stakes final project submissions. Our current approach quantifies procrastination without accounting for these assignment details and might overweight less problematic \u2018procrastination\u2019 in the pooled results. Our measure also focuses on assignment submission in line with the conceptualization of procrastination as the delay of task completion [22], but we are aware that other aspects of assignment-related activities, such as the time of first access and the frequency of attempts, can also be leveraged to measure procrastination which might lead to different results. For instance, students who start early and consistently work on assignments until before the deadline would be considered as procrastinating with our measure, but not with measures based on the time of first access [35]. More broadly, online actions captured by log data are imperfect reflections of students\u2019 underlying psychological processes and the broader contexts of these actions. Students identified as procrastinating might be preoccupied with other essential tasks and consciously plan a late start on the focal assignment. A more concerning situation might be that students procrastinate as a result of anxiety and depression caused by challenging life events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

This pursuit of equity is motivated by long-standing disparities in educational access, experiences, and outcomes across students from different sociodemographic groups [ 17] resulting from systemic injustice in society. In learning analytics, centering equity advances the promise of challenging inequitable structures and improving the education system [ 41]. This vision requires approaching learning analytics research and applications through a few different perspectives, such as algorithmic fairness [ 4, 23], value-sensitive and human-centered design [7, 10], and critical theories [45]. The foundation of these inquiries is that the identities of individual students involved are known, so that researchers or practitioners can observe the unique experience of vulnerable and marginalized student populations, which might differ from that of their majority counterparts and be masked in population-level analyses. However, due to administrative constraints, privacy concerns, and other limitations, a large share of existing learning analytics research does not analyze students\u2019 sociodemographic characteristics [ 30, 43] and therefore runs the risk of misunderstanding students from underserved communities and reproducing existing inequities even with technically sound models. Among the smaller body of literature that explicitly examines learning behavior in regard to students\u2019 demographics, Kizilcec et al . [25] compared engagement trajectories in MOOCs between learners of different genders, ages and employment conditions; Nguyen et al . [28] focused on racial gaps in a distance learning setting and identified higher levels of behavioral engagement and lower performance among racial minority groups.

Some of these strategies support the regulation of internal resources, such as effective ways of memorizing information. Others help regulate external resources, including setting goals, managing time, etc. Empirical studies have identified time management skills as a strong predictor of academic success [24, 46], and procrastination is often considered evidence that students struggle with time management [6].\nThe concept of procrastination originally means \u0142to defer intended action\u017e, which can occur for a variety of reasons. For some students, procrastination is a strategic delay in tasks to achieve positive outcomes [12]. These students tend to perform better under pressure and completing tasks closer to deadlines can create such an environment for them [11, 13]. However, the majority of modern research focuses on passive procrastination, i.e., delaying action when knowing that the delay will make them worse off [37]. Across a large body of empirical studies, this type of procrastination is mostly harmful, sometimes harmless, but never helpful for students\u2019 academic performance and wellbeing [6, 22, 37].\nPrior research has also identified a number of intrinsic and external factors that contribute to procrastination. Intrinsic factors include established psychological characteristics and personality traits, such as conscientiousness, distractibility, organization, achievement motivation, and the gap between one\u2019s intentions and actions [37]. While some of these intrinsic factors are stable traits across contexts (e.g., conscientiousness), others are malleable (e.g., organization skills, achievement motivation) and can therefore be affected by interventions. External factors include a diverse range of task attributes (e.g., the format and complexity of the task) and environmental attributes (e.g., distractions in the study environment) [38]. In formal classroom settings, a multitude of intrinsic and external factors jointly shape students\u2019 procrastination behavior.

This encourages future research on how specific course and task characteristics affect this relationship, especially in small classes where this relationship varies the most and instructors have more flexibility in instructional design and policies. Such insights can inform dynamic interventions to counteract undesirable procrastination behavior. Second, using the same modeling approach, researchers can study within-individual variation (or stability) in procrastination behavior over time and across concurrent courses. Students sometimes procrastinate due to busy course schedules, new learning environments (e.g., first year of college), or other contextual factors. Students may also develop self-regulated learning skills throughout their college experience that reduce the chance of procrastination. In any case, tracking procrastination behavior at the individual level may shed light on students\u2019 educational contexts and development of study habits and help improve institutional policies to better support student success. Finally, this study exemplifies equity-oriented learning analytics research, which is a growing area of research [30, 41].

These self-imposed binding deadlines are correlated with a better performance than without binding deadlines though performance is best for evenly spaced external binding deadlines. Finally, students have difficulties optimally setting self-imposed deadlines, with results suggesting a lack of spacing before the date at which results are due.\n\nIn one experiment, participation in online exercises was found to be five times higher in the final week before a deadline than in the summed total of the first three weeks for which the exercises were available. Procrastinators end up being the ones doing most of the work in the final week before a deadline.\n\nProcrastinators have been found to receive worse grades than non-procrastinators. Tice et al.

The negative association between procrastination and academic performance is recurring and consistent. Howell et al.

They also sought to measure this behavior objectively. During a course, students could complete exam practice computer exercises at their own pace, and during the supervised class time could also complete chapter quizzes. A weighted average of the times at which each chapter quiz was finished formed the measure of observed procrastination, whilst observed irrationality was quantified with the number of practice exercises that were left uncompleted. Researchers found that there was only a moderate correlation between observed and self-reported procrastination (r = 0.35). There was a very strong inverse relationship between the number of exercises completed and the measure of postponement (r = \u22120.78). Observed procrastination was very strongly negatively correlated with course grade (r = \u22120.87), as was self-reported procrastination (though less so, r = \u22120.36). As such, self-reported measures of procrastination, on which the majority of the literature is based, may not be the most appropriate measure to use in all cases.

This large-scale behavioral study advances the understanding of academic procrastination through an equity lens and informs the development of scalable interventions to mitigate the negative effects of procrastination."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-149973": 1, "wikipedia-917966": 1, "wikipedia-15092946": 1, "wikipedia-46764212": 1, "wikipedia-28382955": 1, "wikipedia-36847019": 1, "wikipedia-619350": 1, "wikipedia-3477886": 1, "wikipedia-255475": 1, "wikipedia-29303703": 1, "arxiv-2501.15770": 1, "arxiv-2312.13581": 1, "arxiv-1112.1670": 1, "arxiv-2309.04833": 1, "arxiv-2210.10568": 1, "arxiv-2101.10191": 1, "arxiv-2012.10912": 1, "arxiv-2503.01139": 1, "arxiv-1802.07350": 1, "arxiv-2201.00303": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/32": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/5": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/2": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/4": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/6": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/34": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-149973": 2, "wikipedia-917966": 1, "wikipedia-15092946": 1, "wikipedia-46764212": 1, "wikipedia-28382955": 1, "wikipedia-36847019": 1, "wikipedia-619350": 1, "wikipedia-3477886": 1, "wikipedia-255475": 1, "wikipedia-29303703": 1, "arxiv-2501.15770": 1, "arxiv-2312.13581": 1, "arxiv-1112.1670": 1, "arxiv-2309.04833": 1, "arxiv-2210.10568": 1, "arxiv-2101.10191": 1, "arxiv-2012.10912": 1, "arxiv-2503.01139": 1, "arxiv-1802.07350": 1, "arxiv-2201.00303": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/32": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/5": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/2": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/4": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/6": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/7": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/0": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/34": 1}}}

The Johnson Model was subsequently taught years later at the Johnson Institute. It focuses on creating a confrontation between a group of supporters and the addict in order to expose the addict to the consequences of their addiction. The confrontation serves to precipitate a crisis in the addict's life that is not threatening, damaging, or fatal, and is used to compel them into treatment before they are able to suffer irreparable social or physical damage as a result of their disease.\n\nThe Arise Intervention Model involves exposing the addict and their family members to a collaborative intervention process. Rather than being confrontational, the Arise Model is invitational, non-secretive, and a gradually-escalating process.\n\nThe RAAD model focuses on using positive psychology and setting up the scene and removing barriers prior to the actual in person intervention. It uses Active listening and open ended questions in a sales process that puts the client in the drivers seat to make an educated decision. The process is quicker (5 hours) and creates less resistance on the part of the client. \n\nThe Systemic Family Model may use either an invitational or confrontational approach. It differs from the Johnson Model in that the focus is on fostering a patient, firm coaching instead of creating a negative confrontation. Rather than focusing on the addict, the interventionist fosters discussion with the entire family on how their behavior contributes to the addict\u2019s continued abuse of substances, and how to approach the problem as a family unit.\n\nWhile some interventionists will prescribe to one of the above models over the others, many are able to blend the three models based on what will be most effective for the addict and their family.\n\nPlans for an intervention are made by a concerned group of family, friends, and counselor(s), rather than by the drug or alcohol abuser. Whether it is invitation model or direct model, the abuser is not included in the decision making process for planning the intervention. A properly conducted direct intervention is planned through cooperation between the identified abuser's family or friends and an intervention counselor, coordinator, or educator. It is important to perform the intervention in an open, large space so as to reassure the abuser that they are not trapped or cornered. Ample time must be given to the specific situation; however, basic guidelines can be followed in the intervention planning process. (An intervention can also be conducted in the workplace with colleagues and with no family present.)\n\nPrior to the intervention, the family meets with a counselor or interventionist. Families prepare letters in which they describe their experiences associated with the addict's behavior, to convey to the person the impact his or her addiction has had on others. Also during the intervention rehearsal meeting, a group member is strongly urged to create a list of activities by the addict that they will no longer tolerate, finance, or participate in if the addict does not agree to check into a rehabilitation center for treatment. These consequences may be as simple as no longer loaning money to the addict, but can be far more serious, such as losing custody of a child.\n\nFamily and friends read their letters to the addict, who then must decide whether to check into the prescribed rehabilitation center or deal with the promised losses."], "wikipedia-5289263": ["A defusing is done the day of the incident before the person(s) has a chance to sleep. The defusing is designed to assure the person or people involved that their feelings are normal, to tell them what symptoms to watch for over the short term, and to offer them a lifeline in the form of a telephone number where they can reach someone whom they can talk to. Defusings are limited only to individuals directly involved in the incident and are often done informally, sometimes at the scene. They are designed to assist individuals in coping in the short term and address immediate needs.\n\nDebriefings are usually the second level of intervention for those directly affected by the incident and often the first for those not directly involved.\nA debriefing is normally done within 72 hours of the incident and gives the individual or group the opportunity to talk about their experience, how it has affected them, brainstorm coping mechanisms, identify individuals at risk, and inform the individual or group about services available to them in their community. The final step is to follow up with them the day after the debriefing to ensure that they are safe and coping well or to refer the individual for professional counselling.\nAlthough many have co-opted the debriefing process for use with other groups, the primary focus in the field of CISM is to support staff members of organizations or members of communities which have experienced a traumatic event. The debriefing process (defined by the International Critical Incident Stress Foundation [ICISF]) has seven steps: introduction of intervenor and establishment of guidelines and invites participants to introduce themselves (while attendance at a debriefing may be mandatory, participation is not); details of the event given from individual perspectives; emotional responses given subjectively; personal reaction and actions; followed again by a discussion of symptoms exhibited since the event; instruction phase where the team discusses the symptoms and assures participants that any symptoms (if they have any at all) are a normal reaction to an abnormal event and \"generally\" these symptoms will diminish with time and self-care; following a brief period of shared informal discussion (generally over a beverage and treat) resumption of duty where individuals are returned to their normal tasks. The intervenor is always watching for individuals who are not coping well and additional assistance is offered at the conclusion of the process.\n\nThe important final step is follow-up. This is generally done within the week following the debriefing by team members as a check-in."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

If the metric is named or contextualized, the relevant Wikipedia page would likely provide at least a partial answer. If the metric is too niche or undefined, further clarification might be needed.", "wikipedia-1561467": ["In mathematics, a metric or distance function is a function that defines a distance between each pair of elements of a set. A set with a metric is called a metric space. A metric induces a topology on a set, but not all topologies can be generated by a metric. A topological space whose topology can be described by a metric is called metrizable.\nAn important source of metrics in differential geometry are metric tensors, bilinear forms that may be defined from the tangent vectors of a differentiable manifold onto a scalar. A metric tensor allows distances along curves to be determined through integration, and thus determines a metric. However, not every metric comes from a metric tensor in this way.\nSection::::Definition.\nA metric on a set is a function (called the \"distance function\" or simply distance)\nwhere formula_2 is the set of non-negative real numbers and for all formula_3, the following conditions are satisfied:\nConditions 1 and 2 together define a \"positive-definite function\". \nThe first condition is implied by the others.\nA metric is called an ultrametric if it satisfies the following stronger version of the \"triangle inequality\" where points can never fall 'between' other points:\nfor all formula_3\nA metric on is called intrinsic if any two points and in can be joined by a curve with length arbitrarily close to .\nFor sets on which an addition + : is defined,\nfor all , , and in .\nSection::::Notes.\nThese conditions express intuitive notions about the concept of distance. For example, that the distance between distinct points is positive and the distance from \"x\" to \"y\" is the same as the distance from \"y\" to \"x\". The triangle inequality means that the distance from \"x\" to \"z\" via \"y\" is at least as great as from \"x\" to \"z\" directly. Euclid in his work stated that the shortest distance between two points is a line; that was the triangle inequality for his geometry."], "wikipedia-20018": ["The metric is a function that defines a concept of \"distance\" between any two members of the set, which are usually called points. The metric satisfies a few simple properties. Informally:\nBULLET::::- the distance from a point to itself is zero,\nBULLET::::- the distance between two distinct points is positive,\nBULLET::::- the distance from \"A\" to \"B\" is the same as the distance from \"B\" to \"A\", and\nBULLET::::- the distance from \"A\" to \"B\" (directly) is less than or equal to the distance from \"A\" to \"B\" via any third point \"C\".\nA metric on a space induces topological properties like open and closed sets, which lead to the study of more abstract topological spaces.\nThe most familiar metric space is 3-dimensional Euclidean space. In fact, a \"metric\" is the generalization of the Euclidean metric arising from the four long-known properties of the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean metric defines the distance between two points as the length of the straight line segment connecting them."], "wikipedia-537539": ["Among the most common metrics used to measure inequality are the Gini index (also known as Gini coefficient), the Theil index, and the Hoover index. They have all four properties described above.\n\nAn additional property of an inequality metric that may be desirable from an empirical point of view is that of 'decomposability'. This means that if a particular economy is broken down into sub-regions, and an inequality metric is computed for each sub region separately, then the measure of inequality for the economy as a whole should be a weighted average of the regional inequalities plus a term proportional to the inequality in the averages of the regions. (in a weaker form, it means that it should be an explicit function of sub-regional inequalities, though not necessarily linear). Of the above indexes, only the Theil index has this property.\n\nBecause these income inequality metrics are summary statistics that seek to aggregate an entire distribution of incomes into a single index, the information on the measured inequality is reduced. This information reduction of course is the goal of computing inequality measures, as it reduces complexity.\n\nA weaker reduction of complexity is achieved if income distributions are described by shares of total income. Rather than to indicate a single measure, the society under investigation is split into segments, such as into quintiles (or any other percentage of population). Usually each segment contains the same share of income earners. In case of an unequal income distribution, the shares of income available in each segment are different.\n\nIn many cases the inequality indices mentioned above are computed from such segment data without evaluating the inequalities within the segments. The higher the number of segments (such as deciles instead of quintiles), the closer the measured inequality of distribution gets to the real inequality. (If the inequality within the segments is known, the total inequality can be determined by those inequality metrics which have the property of being \"decomposable\".)\n\nQuintile measures of inequality satisfy the transfer principle only in its weak form because any changes in income distribution outside the relevant quintiles are not picked up by this measures; only the distribution of income between the very rich and the very poor matters while inequality in the middle plays no role.\n\nDetails of the three inequality measures are described in the respective Wikipedia articles. The following subsections cover them only briefly.", "The Theil index is an entropy measure. As for any resource distribution and with reference to information theory, \"maximum entropy\" occurs once income earners cannot be distinguished by their resources, i.e. when there is perfect equality. In real societies people can be distinguished by their different resources, with the resources being incomes. The more \"distinguishable\" they are, the lower is the \"actual entropy\" of a system consisting of income and income earners. Also based on information theory, the gap between these two entropies can be called \"redundancy\". It behaves like a negative entropy."], "wikipedia-6811795": ["The notion of \"weak convergence\" requires this convergence to take place for every continuous bounded function formula_3. \nThis notion treats convergence for different functions \"f\" independently of one another, \"i.e.\" different functions \"f\" may require different values of \"N\"\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\"n\" to be approximated equally well (thus, convergence is non-uniform in formula_3).\nThe notion of \"strong convergence\" formalizes the assertion that the measure of each measurable set should converge:\nAgain, no uniformity over the set formula_6 is required.\nIntuitively, considering integrals of 'nice' functions, this notion provides more uniformity than weak convergence.

Once a signal is sent that remyelination is needed, OPC's will first migrate to damaged axon. This process may be signaled or enhanced by microglia or astrocytes at the injured axon site that stimulate migratory OPC pathways From there the cells must differentiate from being progenitors to being pre-oligodendrocytes, then premyelinating oligodendrocytes, and finally mature oligodendrocytes. These oligodendrocytes can then wrap damaged axons with new myelin sheaths. This process of differentiation through several phases has many involved and direct pathways and factors necessary for the completion of this process. It is easy to completely stop remyelination with the failure of a number of pathways.\n\nOne of the difficulties of studying remyelination is the variety of factors that play a role in differentiating oligodendrocyte progenitors. While some factors promote and others inhibit, still some factors that are known to be involved are yet not understood enough to know whether it promotes, inhibits, or does both. Many factors are poorly understood and subject to much change as research is done.\n\nCytokines mediate inflammatory responses that promote pathogen and debris clearance so that further tissue damage is avoided. Too much can mean cell death but failure to propagate cytokines at all in remyelination results in a lack of debris clearance at a damaged axon site; this buildup of myelin and oligodendrocyte debris has been shown to inhibit the differentiation of Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells.\n\nLINGO1, a cell receptor, has been proposed to be involved in the regulation of remyelination. It is thought to inhibit not only axon regeneration but also regulate oligodendrocyte maturation by inhibiting OPC differentiation. Animal studies suggest that when a LINGO1 is inhibited, OPC differentiation and thus remyelination can be promoted at demyelinated sites. LINGO1 gene expression is also known to activate RhoA which may also play a part in inhibition. Myelin debris build up might be responsible for the promotion of the LINGO1 signalling and overall inhibition.\n\nThe Notch-1 receptor pathway is another pathway that inhibits the differentiation of OPCs. When the ligands Jagged1 and Delta, produced by axons, neurons, and astrocytes, are stimulated and bind to the membrane, oligodendrocyte maturation is inhibited.\n\nThe Wnt-\u03b2-Catelin pathway has been shown to also inhibit remyelination when it is dysregulated in the body. Demyelinating diseases have been shown to cause this dysregulation. Possible genes involved inside this pathway are TCF4 and OLIG2 which are both expressed in high amounts in areas where remyelination has failed from demyelinating diseases."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. **Yes**  \n2. arXiv papers often include detailed theoretical discussions, explanations of methodologies, and insights into limitations of specific techniques or concepts, even outside the original study being queried.

First, different cells and tissues express a subset of genes as a direct consequence of cellular differentiation so many genes are turned off. Second, many of the genes code for proteins that are required for survival in very specific amounts so many genes do not change. Third, cells use many other mechanisms to regulate proteins in addition to altering the amount of mRNA, so these genes may stay consistently expressed even when protein concentrations are rising and falling. Fourth, financial constraints limit expression profiling experiments to a small number of observations of the same gene under identical conditions, reducing the statistical power of the experiment, making it impossible for the experiment to identify important but subtle changes. Finally, it takes a great amount of effort to discuss the biological significance of each regulated gene, so scientists often limit their discussion to a subset.

A vague answer to this question is that the more similar two species are, the more finely balanced the suitability of their environment must be in order to allow coexistence. There are limits to the amount of niche differentiation required for coexistence, and this can vary with the type of resource, the nature of the environment, and the amount of variation both within and between the species. \nTo answer questions about niche differentiation, it is necessary for ecologists to be able to detect, measure, and quantify the niches of different coexisting and competing species. This is often done through a combination of detailed ecological studies, controlled experiments (to determine the strength of competition), and mathematical models (Strong 1982, Leibold 1995). To understand the mechanisms of niche differentiation and competition, much data must be gathered on how the two species interact, how they use their resources, and the type of ecosystem in which they exist, among other factors. In addition, several mathematical models exist to quantify niche breadth, competition, and coexistence (Bastolla et al. 2005).

Costs for other forms and scales of businesses may differ.\nBULLET::::- Transactions and fees to be cost out are very specifically defined. The costs of other types of transactions may differ.\nBULLET::::- The cost estimates come from individuals identified as expert respondents. Sometimes the estimates given by such individuals may differ with other experts and with public officials. If so, the responses are cross-checked for consistency.\nBULLET::::- The estimates assume that a business knows what is required and does not waste time. Satisfying regulatory requirements will obviously take longer if the business lacks information or is unable to follow up promptly. A related point here is that DB may not understand \"work-arounds\", \"facilitating fees\", and \"learning time\" that speed or delay approvals and causes variation costs.", "A study commissioned by the Norwegian government alleges methodological weaknesses, an uncertainty in the ability of the indicators to capture the underlying business climate, and a general worry that many countries may find it easier to change their ranking in \"Doing Business\" than to change the underlying business environment.\nIn June 2013, an independent panel appointed by the President of the World Bank and headed by Trevor Manuel of South Africa, issued a review expressing concern about the potential for the report and index to be misinterpreted, the narrowness of the indicators and information base, the data collection methodology, and the lack of peer review. It recommended that the report be retained, but that the aggregate rankings be removed and that a peer-review process be implemented (among other things). Regarding the topics of Paying Taxes and Employing Workers, it noted that \"The latter has already been excluded from the report's rankings. While there is a persuasive case for paying attention to these aspects of doing business, the Bank will need to carefully consider the correct way to assess the regulation and legal environment of these areas if these indicators are to be retained.\"\nThe \"Doing Business criteria\" for measuring the time needed to complete a procedure were based on some simplified assumptions: \"It is assumed that the minimum time required for each procedure is 1 day. Although procedures may take place simultaneously, they cannot start on the same day (that is, simultaneous procedures start on consecutive days)\". These assumptions generated some criticisms especially by countries that were able to complete one or more procedures simultaneously and could therefore be penalized in the final rank. World Bank claimed that the same criteria are applied to all economies and therefore would not produce biased results. In 2014 the possible biases in applying the DB time indicator were mathematically demonstrated in a scientific article appeared on the Rivista italiana di economia demografia e statistica (Italian Review of Economics, Demography, and Statistics - RIEDS).

This complexity often exposes students from marginalized backgrounds to additional obstacles due to systemic issues of equity and inclusion, such as prevailing stereotypes on campus [ 29, 36, 39], experiences of cultural mismatch [ 40], and financial hardship [ 16, 18]. These challenges contribute to the long-standing patterns of lower persistence and graduation rates and post-graduation earnings among students from historically underrepresented groups, especially ethnic and racial minorities and first-generation college students [ 17]. Empirical insights into how these gaps develop throughout students\u2019 college experience can advance our theoretical understanding of inequities and inform academic policies to better support students. During academic terms, students can encounter academic, health, or social challenges that cause them to fall behind with coursework and miss deadlines. Prior studies have emphasized the important role of self-regulated learning skills in the largely autonomous collegiate learning experience [ 6, 49]: self-regulated learners manage their study time effectively across multiple tasks. Issues with self-regulation can contribute to procrastination, which in most educational contexts refers to a student\u2019s voluntary delay of learning effort when they expect negative educational outcomes [ 37]. For example, a student may delay studying for an examination or submitting an assignment until right before it is due. This behavior limits the amount of time they can spend on the task and therefore may compromise the quality of their work. Procrastination is prevalent among college students, with nearly 90% reporting to do so on coursework1, and a large body of empirical research has shown a negative relationship between procrastination and academic performance [ 22].

More importantly, we incorporate an equity lens and extend some earlier, survey-based findings about demographic differences in procrastination and more broadly, self-regulation [5, 42]. The systematic sociodemographic gaps in the prevalence of procrastination that we identify echo existing disparities in the educational experiences across sociodemographic groups and highlight this phenomenon in broader social contexts. Social injustice, prejudice, and stereotypes based on students\u2019 different visible and invisible social identities further affect their levels of confidence, self-efficacy, academic engagement, and social interaction during their college experience. In this context, procrastination is a symptom of systemic issues in education, rather than an individual failure or a root cause of academic underperformance as early research tends to assume. On the other hand, the link between inequality in in-class procrastination and end-of-course performance gaps highlights procrastination as a behavioral antecedent of educational inequality. This micro-level behavioral factor, susceptible to structural external forces and grounded in research on meta-cognition [37], can add granular insights about the development of macro-level achievement gaps through the depiction of associated psychological processes. Practically, the behavioral nature also suggests that procrastination is a malleable factor on which educators can intervene to mitigate the negative consequences on student success and educational equity.

Some of these strategies support the regulation of internal resources, such as effective ways of memorizing information. Others help regulate external resources, including setting goals, managing time, etc. Empirical studies have identified time management skills as a strong predictor of academic success [24, 46], and procrastination is often considered evidence that students struggle with time management [6].\nThe concept of procrastination originally means \u0142to defer intended action\u017e, which can occur for a variety of reasons. For some students, procrastination is a strategic delay in tasks to achieve positive outcomes [12]. These students tend to perform better under pressure and completing tasks closer to deadlines can create such an environment for them [11, 13]. However, the majority of modern research focuses on passive procrastination, i.e., delaying action when knowing that the delay will make them worse off [37]. Across a large body of empirical studies, this type of procrastination is mostly harmful, sometimes harmless, but never helpful for students\u2019 academic performance and wellbeing [6, 22, 37].\nPrior research has also identified a number of intrinsic and external factors that contribute to procrastination. Intrinsic factors include established psychological characteristics and personality traits, such as conscientiousness, distractibility, organization, achievement motivation, and the gap between one\u2019s intentions and actions [37]. While some of these intrinsic factors are stable traits across contexts (e.g., conscientiousness), others are malleable (e.g., organization skills, achievement motivation) and can therefore be affected by interventions. External factors include a diverse range of task attributes (e.g., the format and complexity of the task) and environmental attributes (e.g., distractions in the study environment) [38]. In formal classroom settings, a multitude of intrinsic and external factors jointly shape students\u2019 procrastination behavior.

Many formal languages used in mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics.\nThe most commonly studied formal logics are propositional logic, predicate logic and their modal analogs, and for these there are standard ways of presenting an interpretation. In these contexts an interpretation is a function that provides the extension of symbols and strings of symbols of an object language. For example, an interpretation function could take the predicate \"T\" (for \"tall\") and assign it the extension {\"a\"} (for \"Abraham Lincoln\"). Note that all our interpretation does is assign the extension {a} to the non-logical constant \"T\", and does not make a claim about whether \"T\" is to stand for tall and 'a' for Abraham Lincoln. Nor does logical interpretation have anything to say about logical connectives like 'and', 'or' and 'not'. Though \"we\" may take these symbols to stand for certain things or concepts, this is not determined by the interpretation function.", "Section::::First-order logic.:Interpretations of a first-order language.\nTo ascribe meaning to all sentences of a first-order language, the following information is needed.\nBULLET::::- A domain of discourse \"D\", usually required to be non-empty (see below).\nBULLET::::- For every constant symbol, an element of \"D\" as its interpretation.\nBULLET::::- For every \"n\"-ary function symbol, an \"n\"-ary function from \"D\" to \"D\" as its interpretation (that is, a function \"D\"\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\"D\").\nBULLET::::- For every \"n\"-ary predicate symbol, an \"n\"-ary relation on \"D\" as its interpretation (that is, a subset of \"D\").\nAn object carrying this information is known as a structure ( signature \u03c3), or \u03c3-structure, or \"L\"-structure (of language L), or as a \"model\".\nThe information specified in the interpretation provides enough information to give a truth value to any atomic formula, after each of its free variables, if any, has been replaced by an element of the domain. The truth value of an arbitrary sentence is then defined inductively using the T-schema, which is a definition of first-order semantics developed by Alfred Tarski. The T-schema interprets the logical connectives using truth tables, as discussed above. Thus, for example, is satisfied if and only if both \u03c6 and \u03c8 are satisfied.\nThis leaves the issue of how to interpret formulas of the form and . The domain of discourse forms the range for these quantifiers. The idea is that the sentence is true under an interpretation exactly when every substitution instance of \u03c6(\"x\"), where \"x\" is replaced by some element of the domain, is satisfied. The formula is satisfied if there is at least one element \"d\" of the domain such that \u03c6(\"d\") is satisfied.\nStrictly speaking, a substitution instance such as the formula \u03c6(\"d\") mentioned above is not a formula in the original formal language of \u03c6, because \"d\" is an element of the domain. There are two ways of handling this technical issue. The first is to pass to a larger language in which each element of the domain is named by a constant symbol. The second is to add to the interpretation a function that assigns each variable to an element of the domain. Then the T-schema can quantify over variations of the original interpretation in which this variable assignment function is changed, instead of quantifying over substitution instances.\nSome authors also admit propositional variables in first-order logic, which must then also be interpreted. A propositional variable can stand on its own as an atomic formula. The interpretation of a propositional variable is one of the two truth values \"true\" and \"false.\"\nBecause the first-order interpretations described here are defined in set theory, they do not associate each predicate symbol with a property(or relation), but rather with the extension of that property (or relation). In other words, these first-order interpretations are extensional not intensional.", "The intended interpretation of this language has the point variables range over all points on the Euclidean plane, the line variable range over all lines on the plane, and the incidence relation \"E\"(\"p\",\"l\") holds if and only if point \"p\" is on line \"l\"."], "wikipedia-36087839": ["An aesthetic critic however does not simply say \"it's beautiful\" or \"it's ugly.\" Instead, the aim is to \"explain\" the meaning of a work of art, \"why\" something is beautiful or ugly, or how the meaning of a design should be \"interpreted\", the stronger and weaker sides of a cultural object, etc. For this purpose, aesthetic critics have a toolkit of criteria they can use in their commentary. These criteria include such things as:\nBULLET::::- The motive behind creative activity\nBULLET::::- Total context within which creative activity occurred\nBULLET::::- Techniques or physical forces used to create the aesthetic effect\nBULLET::::- Values, sentiments, interests, needs or ideals that a phenomenon communicates\nBULLET::::- Relationship of an object of criticism to associated objects, themes, traditions, or genres\nBULLET::::- Interaction between observer and observed, and the overall effect\nBULLET::::- Function the object of the criticism fulfills", "What the information means, is in this case not fixed; it is open to interpretation, it has different meanings, and it may be, that what it means can only be established by interacting with the information.

In this way, dreamers are not obliged to agree with what is said and may use their own judgment in deciding which comments appear valid or provide insight. If the dreamwork is done in a group, there may well be several things that are said by participants that seem valid to the dreamer but it can also happen that nothing does.

Le Corbusier described it as a \"range of harmonious measurements to suit the human scale, universally applicable to architecture and to mechanical things\".\n\nWith the Modulor, Le Corbusier sought to introduce a scale of visual measures that would unite two virtually incompatible systems: the Anglo Saxon foot and inch and the French metric system. Whilst he was intrigued by ancient civilisations who used measuring systems linked to the human body: elbow (cubit), finger (digit), thumb (inch) etc., he was troubled by the metre as a measure that was a forty-millionth part of the meridian of the earth.\n\nIn 1943, in response to the French National Organisation for Standardisation's (AFNOR) requirement for standardising all the objects involved in the construction process, Le Corbusier asked an apprentice to consider a scale based upon a man with his arm raised to 2.20 m in height.

For example, a scaling technique might involve estimating individuals' levels of extraversion, or the perceived quality of products. Certain methods of scaling permit estimation of magnitudes on a continuum, while other methods provide only for relative ordering of the entities.\nThe level of measurement is the type of data that is measured.\nThe word scale is sometimes (including in academic literature) used to refer to another composite measure, that of an index. Those concepts are however different."], "wikipedia-1573372": ["The scale of a map is the ratio of a distance on the map to the corresponding distance on the ground. This simple concept is complicated by the curvature of the Earth's surface, which forces scale to vary across a map. Because of this variation, the concept of scale becomes meaningful in two distinct ways. The first way is the ratio of the size of the generating globe to the size of the Earth. The generating globe is a conceptual model to which the Earth is shrunk and from which the map is projected.\nThe ratio of the Earth's size to the generating globe's size is called the nominal scale (= principal scale = representative fraction). Many maps state the nominal scale and may even display a bar scale (sometimes merely called a 'scale') to represent it. The second distinct concept of scale applies to the variation in scale across a map. It is the ratio of the mapped point's scale to the nominal scale. In this case 'scale' means the scale factor (= point scale = particular scale).\nIf the region of the map is small enough to ignore Earth's curvature\u2014a town plan, for example\u2014then a single value can be used as the scale without causing measurement errors. In maps covering larger areas, or the whole Earth, the map's scale may be less useful or even useless in measuring distances. The map projection becomes critical in understanding how scale varies throughout the map. When scale varies noticeably, it can be accounted for as the scale factor. Tissot's indicatrix is often used to illustrate the variation of point scale across a map.", "Definition: on a conformal projection with an isotropic scale, points which have the same scale value may be joined to form the isoscale lines. These are not plotted on maps for end users but they feature in many of the standard texts. (See Snyder pages 203\u2014206.)\nSection::::Point scale (or particular scale).:The representative fraction (RF) or principal scale.\nThere are two conventions used in setting down the equations of any given projection. For example, the equirectangular cylindrical projection may be written as\nHere we shall adopt the first of these conventions (following the usage in the surveys by Snyder). Clearly the above projection equations define positions on a huge cylinder wrapped around the Earth and then unrolled. We say that these coordinates define the projection map which must be distinguished logically from the actual printed (or viewed) maps. If the definition of point scale in the previous section is in terms of the projection map then we can expect the scale factors to be close to unity. For normal tangent cylindrical projections the scale along the equator is k=1 and in general the scale changes as we move off the equator. Analysis of scale on the projection map is an investigation of the change of k away from its true value of unity.\nActual printed maps are produced from the projection map by a \"constant\" scaling denoted by a ratio such as 1:100M (for whole world maps) or 1:10000 (for such as town plans). To avoid confusion in the use of the word 'scale' this constant\nscale fraction is called the representative fraction (RF) of the printed map and it is to be identified with the ratio printed on the map. The actual printed map coordinates for the equirectangular cylindrical projection are\nThis convention allows a clear distinction of the intrinsic projection scaling and the reduction scaling.\nFrom this point we ignore the RF and work with the projection map."], "wikipedia-25650963": ["In the mathematical discipline of descriptive set theory, a scale is a certain kind of object defined on a set of points in some Polish space (for example, a scale might be defined on a set of real numbers).

They facilitate the understanding of both work and general values that individuals uphold. In addition, they assess the importance of each value in people's lives and how the individual strives toward fulfillment through work and other life roles, such as parenting. Most scales have been normalized and can therefore be used cross-culturally for vocational, marketing, and counseling purposes, yielding unbiased results.

Each position along the continuum represents increasingly complex perceptual organizations of cultural difference, which in turn allow increasingly sophisticated experiences of other cultures. By identifying the underlying experience of cultural difference, predictions about behavior and attitudes can be made and education can be tailored to facilitate development along the continuum.

We define the procrastination score for each submission \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 as \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50) / |\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50| (1) where \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 is the timestamp of the submission, |\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50| is the total number of submissions to the same assignment, and \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50) = |\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 \u2264 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50; \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc61 \u2208 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50| is the rank order in terms of the submission time. Ties between submission times are assigned their average rank. By this definition, the later the submission, the more the student procrastinates on this assignment, and the higher this score."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-149973": 1, "wikipedia-1870236": 1, "wikipedia-11358084": 1, "wikipedia-31320716": 1, "wikipedia-232495": 1, "wikipedia-25714505": 1, "wikipedia-31236505": 1, "wikipedia-41969899": 1, "wikipedia-8277431": 1, "wikipedia-381564": 1, "arxiv-1802.07350": 1, "arxiv-2401.00681": 1, "arxiv-2501.15770": 1, "arxiv-2408.01317": 1, "arxiv-1606.03062": 1, "arxiv-2402.01705": 1, "arxiv-2101.10191": 1, "arxiv-2403.10776": 1, "arxiv-2410.02841": 1, "arxiv-2312.13581": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/29": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/32": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/1": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/13": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/17": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-149973": 1, "wikipedia-1870236": 1, "wikipedia-11358084": 1, "wikipedia-31320716": 1, "wikipedia-232495": 1, "wikipedia-25714505": 1, "wikipedia-31236505": 1, "wikipedia-41969899": 1, "wikipedia-8277431": 1, "wikipedia-381564": 1, "arxiv-1802.07350": 1, "arxiv-2401.00681": 1, "arxiv-2501.15770": 1, "arxiv-2408.01317": 1, "arxiv-1606.03062": 1, "arxiv-2402.01705": 1, "arxiv-2101.10191": 1, "arxiv-2403.10776": 1, "arxiv-2410.02841": 1, "arxiv-2312.13581": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/29": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/32": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/0": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/1": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/13": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/17": 1}}}

We find that the gaps in average procrastination visualized in Figure 3 are all statistically significant with similar magnitude. Overall, sociodemographic characteristics do not have strong predictive power, accounting for just 3% of variation in procrastination scores, but this is common in complex social systems and does not itself reduce the significance of the finding [20]."], "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": ["The systematic sociodemographic gaps in the prevalence of procrastination that we identify echo existing disparities in the educational experiences across sociodemographic groups and highlight this phenomenon in broader social contexts. Social injustice, prejudice, and stereotypes based on students\u2019 different visible and invisible social identities further affect their levels of confidence, self-efficacy, academic engagement, and social interaction during their college experience. In this context, procrastination is a symptom of systemic issues in education, rather than an individual failure or a root cause of academic underperformance as early research tends to assume. On the other hand, the link between inequality in in-class procrastination and end-of-course performance gaps highlights procrastination as a behavioral antecedent of educational inequality. This micro-level behavioral factor, susceptible to structural external forces and grounded in research on meta-cognition [37], can add granular insights about the development of macro-level achievement gaps through the depiction of associated psychological processes."], "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/20": ["Model 1 shows that the procrastination score is a significant negative predictor of course grade, and it accounts for 7% of variation in course grade.

Our measure also focuses on assignment submission in line with the conceptualization of procrastination as the delay of task completion [22], but we are aware that other aspects of assignment-related activities, such as the time of first access and the frequency of attempts, can also be leveraged to measure procrastination which might lead to different results. For instance, students who start early and consistently work on assignments until before the deadline would be considered as procrastinating with our measure, but not with measures based on the time of first access [35]. More broadly, online actions captured by log data are imperfect reflections of students\u2019 underlying psychological processes and the broader contexts of these actions. Students identified as procrastinating might be preoccupied with other essential tasks and consciously plan a late start on the focal assignment. A more concerning situation might be that students procrastinate as a result of anxiety and depression caused by challenging life events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

To understand how students learn and what they know, pre-assessment and ongoing assessment are essential. This provides feedback for both teacher and student, with the ultimate goal of improving student learning. Delivery of instruction in the past often followed a \"one size fits all\" approach. In contrast, differentiation is individual student centred, with a focus on appropriate instructional and assessment tools that are fair, flexible, challenging, and engage students in the curriculum in meaningful ways.", "The grouping practices must be flexible, as groups change with regard to the need that must be addressed. Regardless of whether the differentiation of instruction is based upon student readiness, interests, or needs, the dynamic flow of grouping and regrouping is one of the foundations of differentiated instruction. It is important for a differentiated classroom to allow some students to work alone, if this is their best modality for a particular task. (Nunley, 2004)\nDifferentiating by process refers to how a student comes to understand and assimilate facts, concepts and skills (Anderson, 2007). After teaching a lesson, a teacher might break students into small \"ability\" groups based on their readiness. The teacher would then give each group a series of questions, based on each group's appropriate level of readiness-skills, related to the objectives of the lesson. Another way to group the students could be based on the students' learning styles. The main idea behind this is that students are at different levels and learn in different ways, so a teacher can't teach them all the same way.\nAnother model of differentiation, layered curriculum, offers student a choice of assignments but requires that they demonstrate learning to pass the assignment. This eliminates the need for pre-assessment and is useful for teachers with large class loads, such as in high school (Nunley, 2004).\nWhen an educator differentiates by product or performance, they are affording students various ways of demonstrating what they have learned from the lesson or unit (Anderson, 2007; Nunley, 2006). It is done by using menu unit sheets, choice boards or open-ended lists of final product options. It is meant to allow students to show what they learned based on their learning preferences, interests and strengths.\nExamples of differentiated structures include Layered Curriculum, tiered instruction, tic-tac-toe extension menus, Curry/Samara models, RAFT writing activities, and similar designs. (see external links below)\nIn differentiated instruction, teachers respond to students' readiness, instructional needs, interests and learning preferences and provide opportunities for students to work in varied instructional formats. A classroom that utilizes differentiated instruction is a learner-responsive, teacher-facilitated classroom where all students have the opportunity to meet curriculum foundation objectives. Lessons may be on inquiry based, problem based and project based instruction."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

This data covers all courses offered between Fall 2017 and Summer 2021, thus including terms during the COVID-19 pandemic. We extract the timestamp of each assignment submission and the final grade in Canvas for each student in each course. From the university registrar, we also get each student\u2019s sociodemographic characteristics, with the same set of de-identified student IDs used in the LMS data pull. The data uses standard categories for reporting student information to the U.S. Department of Education. Specifically, sex is coded as binary (male/female); first-generation college student is a binary indicator of whether both parents did not complete a bachelor\u2019s degree; underrepresented minority (URM) student is a binary indicator of whether a student is a U.S. citizen who identifies as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, or Native American; race and ethnicity is coded categorically. We apply several filters to the LMS data in order to remove courses with low enrollment and few graded assignments; we describe these data cleaning steps in Section 3.2. We then join the cleaned LMS data with student-level demographic information. The characteristics of the final dataset used in this study are described in Table 1."], "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": ["Our findings based on 2.6 million assignment submission records by 25,659 students across 2,153 courses reveal significant gaps in procrastination behavior between groups of students defined by sex, race/ethnicity, and parental education (RQ1).

It is a key concept in 21st century military operations and is a vital element to facilitate subordinates' initiative and collaboration and cooperation amongst team members in joint operations.\n\nIn military doctrinal handbooks the identified intent artefacts generally express the initial state and situation, the desired end state and outcome, and how to get to the desired end state. Artefacts describing the initial situation are: own and other forces, adversaries, operating environment, terrain, time, preparation for future operations. Artefacts describing the outcome are: purpose, goals, mission, effects and end state. Artefacts describing how to reach the outcome are: concept of operations, tasks to subordinate units, risk willing, how results might enable transition to future operations, objectives, transition conditions, restrictions in conducting operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.\n\nIntent is then defined to consist of the following eight facets.\n- Mission/Goal \u2013 The purpose of the task (the higher-level goals). It provides the rationale why the missions and task are to be executed. It is a high-level definition of the overall intent and is regularly stated in one sentence following on the form of Who, What, When, Where and Why. A Mission/Goal can be described by using the Actions, Effects or a compound State, i.e. situation. Mission/Goal belongs to the intent group outcome.\n- End-State \u2013 The objective of the task in form of a representation of the desired outcome. The desired outcome is described as a state, e.g. completion of a task, the effects from tasks, or even the execution of tasks over time. The purpose is to provide a picture of the End-State. According to Klein (1998, p. 226) in his investigation, the end-state objective was only missing once in the thirty five examined Commander's intent statements. Effect is in this work defined as the physical and/or behavioural state of a system that results from an action, a set of actions, or another effect. The End State is a more detail description of the Mission/Goal statement and can be described in several sentences. An End State can be described by using the Actions, Effects or a compound State, i.e. situation. End State belongs to the intent group outcome.\n- Sequence \u2013 The sequence of steps in the plan \u2013 This is the plan that describes what do in general terms such as Courses of Actions and Course of Effects. Sequence belongs to the intent group execution describing how to reach the desired outcome and include concept of operations, tasks to subordinate units, how results might enable the transition to future operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.\n- Initial State \u2013 The situation that builds the rationale for the plan, what information was available, who was making the decisions, under what time pressure and similar circumstances. Initial State encompass own and other forces, adversaries, operating environment, terrain, time, preparation for future operations. Initial State belongs to the intent group initial situation.\n- Key Decisions \u2013 The key decisions that may have to be made and guide the commander in how to make choices. Key Decisions belongs to the intent group execution and describes how to reach the desired outcome and encompass how results might enable the transition to future operations, transition conditions and expectations of force usage.\n- Antigoals \u2013 Antigoals describe undesired outcomes. Antigoals are meaningful when to clarify alternatives action plans and what the resulting outcome might be. Antigoals are described in the same way as End State with the difference in that antigoals describe the unwanted outcome. In the surveyed doctrinal descriptions of intent, antigoals were not mentioned. Antigoals belong to the intent outcome.\n- Constraints \u2013 Constraints and other considerations that should be taken into account and can vary from policy to weather and terrain.

Theoretically, each staff and subordinate member should be able to reiterate the commander\u2019s intent at any point during the process.\nImplicit intent consists of all the un-vocalized expectations that the commander and all team members have. The implicit intent is developed over a longer time, prior to the mission, and develops from the style of how the commander is conducting the operations with respect to experience, risk willing, use of power and force, diplomacy, ethics, social values, moral, norms, creativity and unorthodox behaviour and the concepts, policies, laws and doctrine agreed to by military, civil, organizations, agencies, nations and coalitions.\nFarell and Lichacz (2004) proposed that implicit intent is an internal expectation of Commander's intent.

Holloway admitted to carjacking at gunpoint but argued he only intended to use his weapon \u201cif any of the drivers had given him a hard time\". The unconditional intent was to carjack without harm to the driver. The conditional intent was to carjack and cause harm to the driver if the driver became uncooperative.\nThe issue of this case was whether the statute's phrase, \"with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm\" applies to a defendant\u2019s unconditional intent or conditional intent. The Court found that although the construction of the phrase suggests that Congress meant to provide \u201ca federal penalty for only those carjackings in which the offender actually attempted to harm or kill the driver\u2026that a commonsense reading of the carjacking statute counsels that Congress intended to criminalize a broader scope of conduct than attempts to assault or kill in the course of automobile robberies\u201d. The Court, therefore, affirmed Holloway\u2019s conviction and held that a defendant\u2019s conditional intent may violate a federal crime depending on the context and purpose of the statute.\nSection::::Purpose intent and knowledge intent.\nIn many situations in the United States, a person is considered to have acted with intent if the definitions of purpose and/or knowledge are satisfied.

Mental mechanisms, including intention, explain behavior in that individuals are seen as actors who have desires and who attempt to achieve goals that are directed by beliefs. Thus, an intentional action is a function to accomplish a desired goal and is based on the belief that the course of action will satisfy a desire.\nThere is also a theoretical distinction between intentionality (intentional actions), and a mental state of intention for the future. Searle (1983) labeled these as intention-in-action and prior intention respectively. Prior intentions reflect forethought about intentions-in-action; prior intentions do not need to be carried out to be considered intentions.

Further research has aimed to test whether infants are simply inclined to look in the direction of head movements, without any real understanding of another individual's psychological state. Brooks (1999) found that children do not direct attention simply toward the visual hemisphere of novel head movements; rather, children as young as 15 months attend to object-directed eye gaze, suggesting that children are attending to referents to which others attend, and are not simply gazing in a similar direction. These results support the idea that infants understand eye gaze as an indicator of another individual's psychological state, which is a basic component of understanding that others may have intentions separate from one's own.", "In the theory of reasoned action, intention is influenced by people's attitude toward performing the behavior and the subjective norm.

Given the multifaceted nature of procrastination established in psychological research [37], we acknowledge that any single behavioral measure can only capture certain aspects of procrastination, and that our approach might be a more scalable and convenient, but not necessarily more accurate, measure of procrastination. For example, even on the same platform, assignments have varying levels of importance, with some being frequent low-stakes quizzes attached to individual pieces of course material and others being high-stakes final project submissions. Our current approach quantifies procrastination without accounting for these assignment details and might overweight less problematic \u2018procrastination\u2019 in the pooled results. Our measure also focuses on assignment submission in line with the conceptualization of procrastination as the delay of task completion [22], but we are aware that other aspects of assignment-related activities, such as the time of first access and the frequency of attempts, can also be leveraged to measure procrastination which might lead to different results. For instance, students who start early and consistently work on assignments until before the deadline would be considered as procrastinating with our measure, but not with measures based on the time of first access [35]. More broadly, online actions captured by log data are imperfect reflections of students\u2019 underlying psychological processes and the broader contexts of these actions. Students identified as procrastinating might be preoccupied with other essential tasks and consciously plan a late start on the focal assignment. A more concerning situation might be that students procrastinate as a result of anxiety and depression caused by challenging life events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Without additional contextual information, our procrastination measure, as much as any other purely behavior-based measure, can only be taken as an approximation."], "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/8": ["Education researchers, policy makers and practitioners have prioritized the improvement of educational equity as a central objective. This pursuit of equity is motivated by long-standing disparities in educational access, experiences, and outcomes across students from different sociodemographic groups [ 17] resulting from systemic injustice in society. In learning analytics, centering equity advances the promise of challenging inequitable structures and improving the education system [ 41]. This vision requires approaching learning analytics research and applications through a few different perspectives, such as algorithmic fairness [ 4, 23], value-sensitive and human-centered design [7, 10], and critical theories [45].

Our measure also focuses on assignment submission in line with the conceptualization of procrastination as the delay of task completion [22], but we are aware that other aspects of assignment-related activities, such as the time of first access and the frequency of attempts, can also be leveraged to measure procrastination which might lead to different results. For instance, students who start early and consistently work on assignments until before the deadline would be considered as procrastinating with our measure, but not with measures based on the time of first access [35]. More broadly, online actions captured by log data are imperfect reflections of students\u2019 underlying psychological processes and the broader contexts of these actions. Students identified as procrastinating might be preoccupied with other essential tasks and consciously plan a late start on the focal assignment.

We visually inspect group differences by graphing the distribution of the procrastination score in Figure 2. We find that procrastination scores are normally distributed and centered around 0.5, but the distribution is shifted up for male students, first-generation college students, and especially URM students. This suggests that these groups of students exhibit more procrastination behavior on average compared to their peers.\nTo understand the magnitude of these differences, we plot the mean procrastination score for each subgroup on the same scale in Figure 3. A mean procrastination score of 0.5 indicates that, on average, students in this group tend to submit their assignments neither early nor late relative to others; for instance, in a class of 40 students, they tend to be the 20th person to submit. We find that this is the case for female students, continuing-generation college students, and non-URM students, but not their counterparts. For instance, the mean procrastination score among URM students is 5 percentage points higher (\ud835\udc43 = 0.55). Moreover, disaggregating ethnic and racial groups shows substantial variation in procrastination behavior, with the highest average score among Black students (\ud835\udc43 = 0.59) and the lowest among White students (\ud835\udc43 = 0.49).\nWe identify several identity-based sources of variation in procrastination. To understand their concurrent relationship with procrastination behavior, we fit a multiple regression model predicting the procrastination score with all the student characteristics in Figure 2 except for the URM indicator due to its collinearity with the specific racial and ethnic categories. Table 2 reports the model estimates. The predictors are coded such that the intercept represents the largest subgroup, which also happens to have the lowest mean procrastination score: White female continuing-generation college students. We find that the gaps in average procrastination visualized in Figure 3 are all statistically significant with similar magnitude.

While some of these intrinsic factors are stable traits across contexts (e.g., conscientiousness), others are malleable (e.g., organization skills, achievement motivation) and can therefore be affected by interventions.

It could be further stated as a habitual or intentional delay of starting or finishing a task despite knowing it might have negative consequences. It is a common human experience involving delay in everyday chores or even putting off salient tasks such as attending an appointment, submitting a job report or academic assignment, or broaching a stressful issue with a partner. Although typically perceived as a negative trait due to its hindering effect on one's productivity often associated with depression, low self-esteem, guilt and inadequacy; it can also be considered a wise response to certain demands that could present risky or negative outcomes or require waiting for new information to arrive.", "To a certain degree it is normal to procrastinate and it can be regarded as a useful way to prioritize between tasks, due to a lower tendency of procrastination on truly valued tasks (for most people). On the other hand, excessive procrastination can become a problem and impede normal functioning. When this happens, procrastination has been found to result in health problems, stress, anxiety, sense of guilt and crisis as well as loss of personal productivity and social disapproval for not meeting responsibilities or commitments. Together these feelings may promote further procrastination and for some individuals procrastination becomes almost chronic. Such procrastinators may have difficulties seeking support due to procrastination itself, but also social stigma and the belief that task-aversion is caused by laziness, lack of willpower or low ambition. In some cases problematic procrastination might be a sign of some underlying psychological disorder, but not necessarily.", "\"Student syndrome\" refers to the phenomenon where a student will begin to fully apply themself to a task only immediately before a deadline. This negates the usefulness of any buffers built into individual task duration estimates. Results from a 2002 study indicate that many students are aware of procrastination and accordingly set binding deadlines long before the date for which a task is due. These self-imposed binding deadlines are correlated with a better performance than without binding deadlines though performance is best for evenly spaced external binding deadlines. Finally, students have difficulties optimally setting self-imposed deadlines, with results suggesting a lack of spacing before the date at which results are due.\nIn one experiment, participation in online exercises was found to be five times higher in the final week before a deadline than in the summed total of the first three weeks for which the exercises were available. Procrastinators end up being the ones doing most of the work in the final week before a deadline.\nOther reasons cited on why students procrastinate include fear of failure and success, perfectionist expectations, as well as legitimate activities that may take precedence over school work, such as a job.\nProcrastinators have been found to receive worse grades than non-procrastinators. Tice et al. (1997) report that more than one-third of the variation in final exam scores could be attributed to procrastination. The negative association between procrastination and academic performance is recurring and consistent. Howell et al. (2006) found that, though scores on two widely used procrastination scales were not significantly associated with the grade received for an assignment, self-report measures of procrastination on the assessment itself were negatively associated with grade.\nIn 2005, a study conducted by Angela Chu and Jin Nam Choi and published in the \"Journal of Social Psychology\" intended to understand task performance among procrastinators with the definition of procrastination as the absence of self-regulated performance, from the 1977 work of Ellis & Knaus. In their study they identified two types of procrastination: the traditional procrastination which they denote as passive, and active procrastination where the person finds enjoyment of a goal-oriented activity only under pressure. The study calls this active procrastination positive procrastination, as it is a functioning state in a self-handicapping environment. In addition, it was observed that active procrastinators have more realistic perceptions of time and perceive more control over their time than passive procrastinators, which is considered a major differentiator between the two types. But surprisingly, active and passive procrastinators showed similar levels of academic performance. The population of the study was college students and the majority of the sample size were women and Asian in origin. Comparisons with chronic pathological procrastination traits were avoided."], "wikipedia-232495": ["Section::::Psychological theories.:Procrastination.\nProcrastination is the act to voluntarily postpone or delay an intended course of action despite anticipating that you will be worse off because of that delay. While procrastination was once seen as a harmless habit, recent studies indicate otherwise. In a 1997 study conducted by Dianne Tice and William James Fellow Roy Baumeister at Case Western University, college students were given ratings on an established scale of procrastination, and tracked their academic performance, stress, and health throughout the semester. While procrastinators experienced some initial benefit in the form of lower stress levels (presumably by putting off their work at first), they ultimately earned lower grades and reported higher levels of stress and illness.\n\nProcrastination can be seen as a defense mechanism. Because it is less demanding to simply avoid a task instead of dealing with the possibility of failure, procrastinators choose the short-term gratification of delaying a task over the long-term uncertainty of undertaking it. Procrastination can also be a justification for when the user ultimately has no choice but to undertake a task and performs below their standard. For example, a term paper could be seem as a daunting task. If the user puts it off until the night before, they can justify their poor score by telling themselves that they would have done better with more time. This kind of justification is extremely harmful and only helps to perpetuate the cycle of procrastination.\n\nOver the years, scientists have determined that not all procrastination is the same. The first type are chronic procrastinators whom exhibit a combination of qualities from the other, more specialized types of procrastinators. \"Arousal\" types are usually self-proclaimed \"pressure performers\" and relish the exhilaration of completing tasks close to the deadline. \"Avoider\" types procrastinate to avoid the outcome of whatever task they are pushing back - whether it be a potential failure or success. \"Avoider\" types are usually very self-conscious and care deeply about other people's opinions. Lastly, \"Decisional\" procrastinators avoid making decisions in order to protect themselves from the responsibility that follows the outcome of events."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Students sometimes procrastinate due to busy course schedules, new learning environments (e.g., first year of college), or other contextual factors. Students may also develop self-regulated learning skills throughout their college experience that reduce the chance of procrastination. In any case, tracking procrastination behavior at the individual level may shed light on students\u2019 educational contexts and development of study habits and help improve institutional policies to better support student success. Finally, this study exemplifies equity-oriented learning analytics research, which is a growing area of research [30, 41].

We visually inspect group differences by graphing the distribution of the procrastination score in Figure 2. We find that procrastination scores are normally distributed and centered around 0.5, but the distribution is shifted up for male students, first-generation college students, and especially URM students. This suggests that these groups of students exhibit more procrastination behavior on average compared to their peers.\nTo understand the magnitude of these differences, we plot the mean procrastination score for each subgroup on the same scale in Figure 3. A mean procrastination score of 0.5 indicates that, on average, students in this group tend to submit their assignments neither early nor late relative to others; for instance, in a class of 40 students, they tend to be the 20th person to submit. We find that this is the case for female students, continuing-generation college students, and non-URM students, but not their counterparts. For instance, the mean procrastination score among URM students is 5 percentage points higher (\ud835\udc43 = 0.55). Moreover, disaggregating ethnic and racial groups shows substantial variation in procrastination behavior, with the highest average score among Black students (\ud835\udc43 = 0.59) and the lowest among White students (\ud835\udc43 = 0.49).\nWe identify several identity-based sources of variation in procrastination. To understand their concurrent relationship with procrastination behavior, we fit a multiple regression model predicting the procrastination score with all the student characteristics in Figure 2 except for the URM indicator due to its collinearity with the specific racial and ethnic categories. Table 2 reports the model estimates. The predictors are coded such that the intercept represents the largest subgroup, which also happens to have the lowest mean procrastination score: White female continuing-generation college students. We find that the gaps in average procrastination visualized in Figure 3 are all statistically significant with similar magnitude. Overall, sociodemographic characteristics do not have strong predictive power, accounting for just 3% of variation in procrastination scores, but this is common in complex social systems and does not itself reduce the significance of the finding [20]."], "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/0": ["We therefore investigate these questions in the context of assignment submission using campus-wide learning management system (LMS) data from a large U.S. research university.

When participants were asked to memorize the unrelated list, recall and clustering were higher for the organizational task, which produced almost equal results to the self-referential task, suggesting that has an organizational basis. For the list of related words, the elaborative task led to better recall and had matched results to the self-reference task, suggesting an elaborative basis. This research, then, suggests that the self-reference effect cannot be explained by a single type of processing. Instead, self-referential encoding must lead to information in memory that incorporates item specific and relational information.", "In a second experiment by Johnson et al., the group of reference was modified to be the family of the individual. This group has fewer exemplars than the pool of university students, and affective considerations of the family as a group should be strong. No specific instructions or definitions were provided for family, allowing individuals to consider either the group as a whole (prototype) or specific exemplars (group). When the experiment was repeated using family as the group of reference, group-reference produced recall as much as self-reference. The mean number of recall for the group-reference was higher than self-reference. Participants indicated that they considered both the prototype and individual exemplars when responding to the questions, suggesting that the magnitude of the group-reference effect might not be dependent on the number of exemplars in the target group.\nBoth experiments presented by Johnson et al. found evidence for the group-reference effect. However, these conclusions are limited to the target groups of university students and family. Other research included gender (males and females) and religion (Jewish) as the reference groups and the group-reference effect on memory was not as evident. The group-reference recall for these two groups was not significantly more advantageous than the semantic task. Questioning what characteristics of reference groups that lead to the group-reference effect, a meta-analysis of all four group-reference conditions was performed. This analysis found that self-reference emerged as the most powerful encoding device; however, evidence was found to support the existence of a group-reference effect. The size of the reference groups and number of specific, individual exemplars was hypothesized to influence the existence of the group-reference effect. In addition, accessibility and level of knowledge about group members may also impact such an effect. So, while university students is a much larger group than family, individual exemplars may be more readily accessible than those in a religious group. Similarly, different cognitive representations were hypothesized to influence the group-reference effect. When a larger group is considered, people may be more likely to consider a prototype which may lead to fewer elaborations and cues later on. Smaller groups may lead to relying on the prototype and specific exemplars. Finally, desirability judgments that influence later processing may be influenced by self-reference and certain group-reference tasks. Individuals may be more sensitive to evaluative implications for the personal self and some group identities, but not others.\nGroups are also a major part of the self; therefore we attribute the role that different groups play in our self-concept also play a role in the self-reference effect. We process information about group members similarly to how we process for ourselves. Recall of remarks referencing our home and our self and group to familiarity of those aspects of our self. Reference to the self and social group and the identity that comes along with being a part of a social group are equally affective for memory. This is especially true when the groups are small, rather than large.\nUltimately, the group-reference effect provides evidence to explain the tendency to notice or pay attention to and remember statements made in regard to our home when traveling in a foreign place. Considering the proposal that groups form part of the self, this phenomenon can be considered an extension of the self-reference effect.

This encourages future research on how specific course and task characteristics affect this relationship, especially in small classes where this relationship varies the most and instructors have more flexibility in instructional design and policies. Such insights can inform dynamic interventions to counteract undesirable procrastination behavior. Second, using the same modeling approach, researchers can study within-individual variation (or stability) in procrastination behavior over time and across concurrent courses. Students sometimes procrastinate due to busy course schedules, new learning environments (e.g., first year of college), or other contextual factors. Students may also develop self-regulated learning skills throughout their college experience that reduce the chance of procrastination. In any case, tracking procrastination behavior at the individual level may shed light on students\u2019 educational contexts and development of study habits and help improve institutional policies to better support student success. Finally, this study exemplifies equity-oriented learning analytics research, which is a growing area of research [30, 41].

Children who are raised in poverty are less likely to be enrolled in nursery or preschool.", "Explanations for the achievement gap and concerns over its effects and even the existence of such a gap are widely contested.\u00a0 These explanations are also the source of much controversy, especially since efforts to \"close the gap\" have become some of the more politically prominent education reform issues. The issues that the achievement gap perpetuate also hold politically charged issues. For example, the cause of the Latino education crisis is not attributable to any single factor. It is likely the result of multiple variables\u2014all of which can have an effect on one another\u2014ranging from social, economic, and educational conditions to inadequate social services and families with exceptionally low human and social capital. The effects of the achievement gap in school can be seen later in life for students. For example, since schools often lack the resources to meet many students' most basic educational needs and since there are few entry level jobs that provide a living wage and benefits available to those without higher education or special skills in the economy, many are left at a disadvantage.", "Sociologists Christopher Jencks and Meredith Phillips have argued that narrowing the black-white test score gap \"would do more to move [the United States] toward racial equality than any politically plausible alternative\". As already discussed, there is also strong evidence that narrowing the gap would have a significant positive economic and social impact.", "Section::::Racial achievement gap.:High school graduation.\n\"Completed High School age 25-29 (1998)\"\nUS Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans age 25 to 29 had completed high school, lagging only slightly behind 93 percent for whites. For all over the age of 25, clear majorities of whites, Asian Americans and African Americans had graduated at 88 percent, 85 percent and 77 percent, respectively. 56 percent, or barely over half of Hispanics 25 and over, had completed high school.\n\nSection::::Racial achievement gap.:Special programs.\nAchievement gaps among students may also manifest themselves in the racial and ethnic composition of special education and gifted education programs.

This report was commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education in 1966 to investigate whether the performance of African-American students was caused by their attending schools of a lesser quality than white students. The report suggested that both in-school factors and home/community factors affect the academic achievement of students and contribute to the achievement gap that exists between races.", "Section::::Theories about the origin of the racial achievement gap.:Education Debt. Education debt is a theory developed by Gloria Ladson-Billings, a pedagogical theorist.  In her theory of education debt, she likens the focus of the achievement gap to the United States current focus on the national deficit. She argues that instead the true issue is debt rather than deficit: an education debt to African Americans, Native Americans, and Latino/as.  As defined by a colleague of Ladson-Billings, Professor Emeritus Robert Haveman, education debt is the \u201cforegone schooling resources that we could have (should have) been investing in (primarily) low income kids, which deficit leads to a variety of social problems (e.g. crime, low productivity, low wages, low labor force participation) that require on-going public investment\u201d. The education debt has historical, economic, sociopolitical and moral components; the structure of the education debt theory makes is a logical cause of the racial achievement gap.", "These factors directly determine the access of the parents to time and resources to dedicate to their children's development. These factors also indirectly determine the home environment and parents' educational expectations of their children. For example, children from poor families have lower academic performance in kindergarten than children from middle to upper-class backgrounds, but children from poor families who had cognitively stimulating materials in the home demonstrated higher rates of academic achievement in kindergarten. Additionally, parents of children living in poverty are less likely to have cognitively stimulating materials in the home for their children and are less likely to be involved in their child's school. The quality of language that the student uses is affected by family's socioeconomic backgrounds, which is another factor in the academic achievement gap.", "Non-White minority groups are classified into voluntary and involuntary minority groups, which are differentiated by the reasons that brought the groups to the United States. Voluntary minorities are immigrants who came to the United States for better social, economic, and political opportunities, such as the Chinese and Punjabi Indians. Optimism regarding educational and occupational prospects are reflected in parents' expectations of their children. It should be noted, however, that earlier generations of students from voluntary minority groups tend to perform better and place a higher value on education than native-born and later-generation students of the same group. Involuntary minorities are those from groups who came to the United States or integrated into the United States against their will, such as Native Americans or African Americans. Involuntary minority groups face both external and internal tensions; institutionalized socioeconomic factors prevent social mobility for these groups, in addition to the identity-related conflicts within a minority culture. These ethnic histories thus define the social status of minority groups and thereby influence the schooling experience of minority students.\n\nResearch has shown time and again that the wealth and income of parents is a primary factor influencing student achievement . A low socioeconomic background can have negative effects on a child's educational achievement before even starting school; indeed, research has shown that the achievement gap is present between races before starting formal education. On average, when entering kindergarten, African-American students are one year behind White students in terms of vocabulary and basic math skills, and this gap continues to grow as a child's education continues.", "Achievement gaps among students may also manifest themselves in the racial and ethnic composition of special education and gifted education programs. Typically, African American and Hispanic students are enrolled in greater numbers in special education programs than their numbers would indicate in most populations, while these groups are underrepresented in gifted programs. Research shows that these disproportionate enrollment trends may be a consequence of the differences in educational achievement among groups.", "NCLB has shown mixed success in eliminating the racial achievement gap. Although test scores are improving, they are improving equally for all races, which means that minority students are still behind whites. There has also been some criticism as to whether an increase in test scores actually corresponds to improvements in education, since test standards vary from state to state and from year to year."], "wikipedia-56970574": ["The authors and subsequent researchers have posited that the word gap\u2013or certainly the differing rates of vocabulary acquisition\u2013partially explains the achievement gap in the United States, the persistent disparity in educational performance among subgroups of U.S. students, especially subgroups defined by socioeconomic status and race.", "The Word Gap theory can be seen as part of a larger development in modern educational reform and movement: the Achievement Gap discourse. It is widely accepted and noted by scholars that ideas around individual outcome in schools varies based on various demographics. Explaining variations in achievement in schools across levels of demographics that may result in a gap in student achievement has become the primary problems public schools have to address. The Discourse is based on evidence and assumptions of why primarily poor students of color do not perform at the same levels as their more affluent White and certain Asian group counterparts- it creates language to how schools and communities can be organized more optimally to help students and schools produce more equitable and successful outcomes. The Achievement Gap also addresses a gender gap achievement, and standardized test score gaps broadly across countries, notably with standardized examinations on STEM subjects. The Discourse can also be seen as a turning away from traditional explanations of performance in school as individualistic, to the creation of cultural framework understanding to help explain what conventions hinder and produce successful students. \"Under performing, adequate yearly progress (AYP), highly qualified, below basic, and proficient\" are some terms used to mark good and bad aspects of schools, their teachers, and their students which in turn reifies the Achievement Gap theory. As a broader Discourse, it is an idea which is multimodally shared and accepted as common belief between parents, policy makers, teachers and students through various means according to James Paul Gee\u2019s idea of Discourse in socio-linguistic analysis."], "wikipedia-20381835": ["Unequal educational outcomes are attributed to several variables, including family of origin, gender, and social class. Achievement, earnings, health status, and political participation also contribute to educational inequality within the United States and other countries.\n\nSection::::Family background.\nIn Harvard's \"Civil Rights Project\", Lee and Orfield identify family background as the most influential factor in student achievement. A correlation exists between the academic success of parents with the academic success of their children. Only 11% of children from the bottom fifth earn a college degree while 80% of the top fifth earn one. Linked with resources, white students tend to have more educated parents than students from minority families. This translates to a home-life that is more supportive of educational success. This often leads to them receiving more at-home help, have more books in their home, attend more libraries, and engage in more intellectually intensive conversations. Children, then, enter school at different levels. Poor students are behind in verbal memory, vocabulary, math and reading achievement, and have more behavior problems. This leads to their placement in different level classes that tracks them. These courses almost always demand less from their students, creating a group that is conditioned to lack educational drive. These courses are generally non-college bound and are taught by less qualified teachers."], "wikipedia-47179398": ["Some groups are affected more by this mismatch in aspirations and actual attainment\u2014boys, low income children, African American and Latino children, whose aspirations are similar to those of girls, high income children and children from other racial-ethnic backgrounds but whose attainments are more likely to lag behind."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

We find that procrastination scores are normally distributed and centered around 0.5, but the distribution is shifted up for male students, first-generation college students, and especially URM students. This suggests that these groups of students exhibit more procrastination behavior on average compared to their peers.\n\nTo understand the magnitude of these differences, we plot the mean procrastination score for each subgroup on the same scale in Figure 3. A mean procrastination score of 0.5 indicates that, on average, students in this group tend to submit their assignments neither early nor late relative to others; for instance, in a class of 40 students, they tend to be the 20th person to submit. We find that this is the case for female students, continuing-generation college students, and non-URM students, but not their counterparts. For instance, the mean procrastination score among URM students is 5 percentage points higher (\ud835\udc43 = 0.55). Moreover, disaggregating ethnic and racial groups shows substantial variation in procrastination behavior, with the highest average score among Black students (\ud835\udc43 = 0.59) and the lowest among White students (\ud835\udc43 = 0.49).\n\nWe identify several identity-based sources of variation in procrastination. To understand their concurrent relationship with procrastination behavior, we fit a multiple regression model predicting the procrastination score with all the student characteristics in Figure 2 except for the URM indicator due to its collinearity with the specific racial and ethnic categories. Table 2 reports the model estimates. The predictors are coded such that the intercept represents the largest subgroup, which also happens to have the lowest mean procrastination score: White female continuing-generation college students. We find that the gaps in average procrastination visualized in Figure 3 are all statistically significant with similar magnitude. Overall, sociodemographic characteristics do not have strong predictive power, accounting for just 3% of variation in procrastination scores, but this is common in complex social systems and does not itself reduce the significance of the finding [20]."], "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/1": ["These challenges contribute to the long-standing patterns of lower persistence and graduation rates and post-graduation earnings among students from historically underrepresented groups, especially ethnic and racial minorities and first-generation college students [ 17].

This occurs when the demographic architecture of a population becomes younger and the percentage of people able to work reaches its height. Typically, the demographic window of opportunity lasts for 30\u201340 years depending upon the country. Because of the mechanical link between fertility levels and age structures, the timing and duration of this period is closely associated to those of fertility decline: when birth rates fall, the age pyramid first shrinks with gradually lower proportions of young population (under 15s) and the dependency ratio decreases as is happening (or happened) in various parts of East Asia over several decades. After a few decades, low fertility however causes the population to get older and the growing proportion of elderly people inflates again the dependency ratio as is observed in present-day Europe.\nThe exact technical boundaries of definition may vary. The UN Population Department has defined it as period when the proportion of children and youth under 15\u00a0years falls below 30 per cent and the proportion of people 65 years and older is still below 15 per cent.\nSocieties who have entered the demographic window have smaller dependency ratio (ratio of dependents to working-age population) and therefore the demographic potential for high economic growth as favorable dependency ratios tend to boost savings and investments in human capital.

Insights from this study can inform the development of more equitable learning analytics interventions to support self-regulation and mitigate negative consequences of procrastination."], "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/31": ["The way we operationalize procrastination differs from prior work in that it solely relies on task submission times without having to know detailed information about the tasks per se, but the findings are consistent with previous studies that measured procrastination based on more task-specific information (e.g., difference between assignment deadline and submission time) [15, 21, 26, 33]. Given the multifaceted nature of procrastination established in psychological research [37], we acknowledge that any single behavioral measure can only capture certain aspects of procrastination, and that our approach might be a more scalable and convenient, but not necessarily more accurate, measure of procrastination. For example, even on the same platform, assignments have varying levels of importance, with some being frequent low-stakes quizzes attached to individual pieces of course material and others being high-stakes final project submissions. Our current approach quantifies procrastination without accounting for these assignment details and might overweight less problematic \u2018procrastination\u2019 in the pooled results. Our measure also focuses on assignment submission in line with the conceptualization of procrastination as the delay of task completion [22], but we are aware that other aspects of assignment-related activities, such as the time of first access and the frequency of attempts, can also be leveraged to measure procrastination which might lead to different results. For instance, students who start early and consistently work on assignments until before the deadline would be considered as procrastinating with our measure, but not with measures based on the time of first access [35]. More broadly, online actions captured by log data are imperfect reflections of students\u2019 underlying psychological processes and the broader contexts of these actions. Students identified as procrastinating might be preoccupied with other essential tasks and consciously plan a late start on the focal assignment. A more concerning situation might be that students procrastinate as a result of anxiety and depression caused by challenging life events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Without additional contextual information, our procrastination measure, as much as any other purely behavior-based measure, can only be taken as an approximation."], "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": ["This paper presents a large-scale analysis of behavioral trace data to reveal systematic variations in academic procrastination among college students. Toward this end, we develop a scalable measure of procrastination that can be used in any context with timestamped behavioral data and minimal assumptions about course-specific policies. Our findings based on 2.6 million assignment submission records by 25,659 students across 2,153 courses reveal significant gaps in procrastination behavior between groups of students defined by sex, race/ethnicity, and parental education (RQ1). These gaps are mostly aligned with the direction of established inequities in higher education: URM and first-generation college students who tend to be underachieving also exhibit more procrastination"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-46994286": 1, "wikipedia-13772163": 1, "wikipedia-92028": 1, "wikipedia-35806374": 1, "wikipedia-21312318": 1, "wikipedia-33318990": 1, "wikipedia-36937476": 1, "wikipedia-4700310": 1, "wikipedia-42755364": 1, "wikipedia-23366155": 1, "arxiv-1803.10195": 1, "arxiv-2202.08822": 1, "arxiv-2104.08205": 1, "arxiv-1511.06578": 1, "arxiv-2502.11910": 1, "arxiv-2411.01332": 1, "arxiv-2503.13752": 1, "arxiv-2502.17007": 1, "arxiv-2205.06919": 1, "arxiv-2403.16895": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/8": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/32": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/2": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/3": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/27": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/4": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/31": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/6": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-46994286": 1, "wikipedia-13772163": 1, "wikipedia-92028": 1, "wikipedia-35806374": 1, "wikipedia-21312318": 1, "wikipedia-33318990": 1, "wikipedia-36937476": 1, "wikipedia-4700310": 1, "wikipedia-42755364": 1, "wikipedia-23366155": 1, "arxiv-1803.10195": 1, "arxiv-2202.08822": 1, "arxiv-2104.08205": 1, "arxiv-1511.06578": 1, "arxiv-2502.11910": 1, "arxiv-2411.01332": 1, "arxiv-2503.13752": 1, "arxiv-2502.17007": 1, "arxiv-2205.06919": 1, "arxiv-2403.16895": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/8": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/32": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/2": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/3": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/27": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/4": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/31": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/6": 1}}}

Specifically, let \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 = {\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50; \ud835\udc56 = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50} denote the set of all students\u2019 submissions to assignment \ud835\udc57 in course \ud835\udc50, where \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 represents student \ud835\udc56\u2019s submission and \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 represents the number of enrolled students in course \ud835\udc50. We define the procrastination score for each submission \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 as \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50) / |\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50| (1) where \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 is the timestamp of the submission, |\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50| is the total number of submissions to the same assignment, and \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50) = |\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 \u2264 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50; \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc61 \u2208 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50| is the rank order in terms of the submission time. Ties between submission times are assigned their average rank. By this definition, the later the submission, the more the student procrastinates on this assignment, and the higher this score. We also illustrate in Figure 1 how this assignment-level procrastination score varies for three arbitrary students in a course with 30 assignments. Compared to, for instance, the absolute time difference between the submission and deadline, this approach is highly scalable for two reasons.

This suggests that these groups of students exhibit more procrastination behavior on average compared to their peers.\n\nTo understand the magnitude of these differences, we plot the mean procrastination score for each subgroup on the same scale in Figure 3. A mean procrastination score of 0.5 indicates that, on average, students in this group tend to submit their assignments neither early nor late relative to others; for instance, in a class of 40 students, they tend to be the 20th person to submit. We find that this is the case for female students, continuing-generation college students, and non-URM students, but not their counterparts.

An understanding of how behavioral inequalities arise and contribute to gaps in educational access, experiences and outcomes can inform ways to improve justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in education."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-24891442": 1, "wikipedia-36357967": 1, "wikipedia-626514": 1, "wikipedia-308054": 1, "wikipedia-618384": 1, "wikipedia-30454732": 1, "wikipedia-24965027": 1, "wikipedia-41873246": 1, "wikipedia-27262352": 1, "wikipedia-25430994": 1, "arxiv-2101.03237": 1, "arxiv-1702.07971": 1, "arxiv-1612.04978": 1, "arxiv-2503.13174": 1, "arxiv-2208.04078": 1, "arxiv-2308.10220": 1, "arxiv-2401.17100": 1, "arxiv-1803.05796": 1, "arxiv-1812.06707": 1, "arxiv-2011.09671": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/8": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/12": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/3": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/2": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/10": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/32": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/31": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-24891442": 1, "wikipedia-36357967": 1, "wikipedia-626514": 1, "wikipedia-308054": 1, "wikipedia-618384": 1, "wikipedia-30454732": 1, "wikipedia-24965027": 1, "wikipedia-41873246": 1, "wikipedia-27262352": 1, "wikipedia-25430994": 1, "arxiv-2101.03237": 1, "arxiv-1702.07971": 1, "arxiv-1612.04978": 1, "arxiv-2503.13174": 1, "arxiv-2208.04078": 1, "arxiv-2308.10220": 1, "arxiv-2401.17100": 1, "arxiv-1803.05796": 1, "arxiv-1812.06707": 1, "arxiv-2011.09671": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/8": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/12": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/3": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/2": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/10": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/32": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/31": 1}}}

However, these differences only explain performance gaps to a very limited extent and the negative association between procrastination behavior and performance remains relatively stable across student groups."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-1040219": 1, "wikipedia-5083172": 1, "wikipedia-41419956": 1, "wikipedia-149973": 1, "wikipedia-21411136": 1, "wikipedia-40516414": 1, "wikipedia-33541929": 1, "wikipedia-3418945": 1, "wikipedia-6503420": 1, "wikipedia-201182": 1, "arxiv-1410.6088": 1, "arxiv-1303.0490": 1, "arxiv-1902.05454": 1, "arxiv-1811.06358": 1, "arxiv-2312.13581": 1, "arxiv-2501.15770": 1, "arxiv-2406.11534": 1, "arxiv-2109.00753": 1, "arxiv-2403.06268": 1, "arxiv-2212.13454": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/20": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/0": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/5": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/29": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-1040219": 1, "wikipedia-5083172": 1, "wikipedia-41419956": 1, "wikipedia-149973": 1, "wikipedia-21411136": 1, "wikipedia-40516414": 1, "wikipedia-33541929": 1, "wikipedia-3418945": 1, "wikipedia-6503420": 1, "wikipedia-201182": 1, "arxiv-1410.6088": 1, "arxiv-1303.0490": 1, "arxiv-1902.05454": 1, "arxiv-1811.06358": 1, "arxiv-2312.13581": 1, "arxiv-2501.15770": 1, "arxiv-2406.11534": 1, "arxiv-2109.00753": 1, "arxiv-2403.06268": 1, "arxiv-2212.13454": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/20": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/0": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/5": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/29": 1}}}

The diode, a nonlinear device, is in series with a linear circuit consisting of a resistor, R and a voltage source, V. The characteristic curve \"(curved line)\", representing the current \"I\" through the diode for any given voltage across the diode \"V\", is an exponential curve.

Placing a series of these curves on the graph shows how the base current will affect the operating point of the circuit.\nThe load line diagram at right is for a resistive load in a common emitter circuit.

According to American educational psychologist David Berliner, home and community environments have a stronger impact on school achievement than in-school factors, in part, because students spend more time outside of school than in school. In addition, the out-of-school factors influencing academic performance differ significantly between children living in poverty and children from middle-income households.\n\nFor example, being raised in a low-income family often means having fewer educational resources in addition to poor nutrition and limited access to health care, all of which could contribute to lower academic performance."], "wikipedia-56970574": ["Hart and Risley (2003) spent 2 \u00bd years observing 42 families for an hour each month to learn what typical home life was like for 1 and 2-year-old children. The families were grouped into 4 variables, upper SES, middle SES, lower SES and just a few that were on welfare. They found that by age 3 children in welfare families had a vocabulary of 525 words where children in upper SES families had vocabulary of 1,116 words. They also found that the children in upper-class families were learning vocabulary at a faster rate. The researchers suggested the reason for this difference is because the welfare children heard on average 616 words per hour where professional-family children heard on average 2,153 words per hour. Thus, proposing the 30 Million Word Gap. The achievement gap is explained as a result of the language gap, in that because children are lacking in their vocabulary and literary skills, they will not be as successful in academics. Hart and Risley argue this is an indispensable societal concern because it sets the child at a disadvantage for not being exposed to more vocabulary skills at a young age.", "The Word Gap theory can be seen as part of a larger development in modern educational reform and movement: the Achievement Gap discourse. It is widely accepted and noted by scholars that ideas around individual outcome in schools varies based on various demographics. Explaining variations in achievement in schools across levels of demographics that may result in a gap in student achievement has become the primary problems public schools have to address. The Discourse is based on evidence and assumptions of why primarily poor students of color do not perform at the same levels as their more affluent White and certain Asian group counterparts- it creates language to how schools and communities can be organized more optimally to help students and schools produce more equitable and successful outcomes. The Achievement Gap also addresses a gender gap achievement, and standardized test score gaps broadly across countries, notably with standardized examinations on STEM subjects. The Discourse can also be seen as a turning away from traditional explanations of performance in school as individualistic, to the creation of cultural framework understanding to help explain what conventions hinder and produce successful students. \"Under performing, adequate yearly progress (AYP), highly qualified, below basic, and proficient\" are some terms used to mark good and bad aspects of schools, their teachers, and their students which in turn reifies the Achievement Gap theory. As a broader Discourse, it is an idea which is multimodally shared and accepted as common belief between parents, policy makers, teachers and students through various means according to James Paul Gee\u2019s idea of Discourse in socio-linguistic analysis.\n\nThe effects of the Achievement Gap Discourse cause several cultural phenomena- \u201ccultural gate-keeping,\u201d in which policy makers and education reformers decide and label students as more or less capable and worthy than others. Schools might be called under-performing, which can further affect the policy and financing prescribed by their districts, or even higher authorities.\n\nUsing metric standards to understand the cause in Achievement Gap as a result of ineffective cultural practices also tends to place blame on the families unless there is ample socio-linguistic inquiry to individual family circumstance, which still often creates a Discourse against deemed underachieving students\u2019 culture.\n\nThe Achievement Gap Discourse initiated with two primary modes in American educational studies: Achievement Gap among races, and gap among socioeconomic status (SES). \"The gap Discourse\" does not typically extend across generations or other forms of demographics that have been studied, and further study of Achievement Gap among different dimensions faces the initial stigmatization as a result of the gap Discourse in various studies around the turn of the 21st Century, pin-headed by the 30 million Word Gap.

This behavior limits the amount of time they can spend on the task and therefore may compromise the quality of their work. Procrastination is prevalent among college students, with nearly 90% reporting to do so on coursework1, and a large body of empirical research has shown a negative relationship between procrastination and academic performance [ 22].

Essentially, while the black-white gaps are substantial, both Hispanic and Asian students tend to gain on whites as they progress in school. The white-black achievement gap in math scores is about half a standard deviation, and the white-black achievement gap in reading is a little less than half a standard deviation. By fifth grade, Hispanic and white students have roughly the same math and reading scores. By eighth grade, scores for Hispanic students in North Carolina surpassed those of observationally equivalent whites by roughly a tenth of a standard deviation. Asian students surpass whites on math and reading tests in all years except third and fourth grade reading.

Specifically, they found that about 72% of White students who have completed high school enrolled in college the same year, compared to 44% for Black students, and 50% for Hispanic students. Furthermore, trends in undergraduate and graduate enrollment have shown increases in all ethnicity groups, but the largest gap still exists for Black student enrollment.

If the stimulus is again tripled in strength (i.e., ), the corresponding perception will be three times as strong as its original value (i.e., ). Hence, for multiplications in stimulus strength, the strength of perception only adds. The mathematical derivations of the torques on a simple beam balance produce a description that is strictly compatible with Weber's law."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

Plotting points in this way results in two regions of interest in the plot: those points that are found toward the top of the plot that are far to either the left- or right-hand sides.

The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is sometimes applied to finance correlations. However, the limitations of Pearson correlation approach in finance are evident. First, linear dependencies as assessed by the Pearson correlation coefficient do not appear often in finance. Second, linear correlation measures are only natural dependence measures if the joint distribution of the variables is elliptical. However, only few financial distributions such as the multivariate normal distribution and the multivariate student-t distribution are special cases of elliptical distributions, for which the linear correlation measure can be meaningfully interpreted. Third, a zero Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient does not necessarily mean independence, because only the two first moments are considered. For example, formula_1 (\"y\" \u2260 0) will lead to Pearson correlation coefficient of zero, which is arguably misleading.

Specifically, sex is coded as binary (male/female); first-generation college student is a binary indicator of whether both parents did not complete a bachelor\u2019s degree; underrepresented minority (URM) student is a binary indicator of whether a student is a U.S. citizen who identifies as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, or Native American; race and ethnicity is coded categorically.

Given the multifaceted nature of procrastination established in psychological research [37], we acknowledge that any single behavioral measure can only capture certain aspects of procrastination, and that our approach might be a more scalable and convenient, but not necessarily more accurate, measure of procrastination. For example, even on the same platform, assignments have varying levels of importance, with some being frequent low-stakes quizzes attached to individual pieces of course material and others being high-stakes final project submissions. Our current approach quantifies procrastination without accounting for these assignment details and might overweight less problematic \u2018procrastination\u2019 in the pooled results. Our measure also focuses on assignment submission in line with the conceptualization of procrastination as the delay of task completion [22], but we are aware that other aspects of assignment-related activities, such as the time of first access and the frequency of attempts, can also be leveraged to measure procrastination which might lead to different results. For instance, students who start early and consistently work on assignments until before the deadline would be considered as procrastinating with our measure, but not with measures based on the time of first access [35]. More broadly, online actions captured by log data are imperfect reflections of students\u2019 underlying psychological processes and the broader contexts of these actions. Students identified as procrastinating might be preoccupied with other essential tasks and consciously plan a late start on the focal assignment.

However, succeeding in college requires overcoming numerous challenges simultaneously: students have to manage complex and demanding schedules to keep up with coursework across multiple classes while navigating formative personal, cultural, and financial events. This complexity often exposes students from marginalized backgrounds to additional obstacles due to systemic issues of equity and inclusion, such as prevailing stereotypes on campus [ 29, 36, 39], experiences of cultural mismatch [ 40], and financial hardship [ 16, 18]. These challenges contribute to the long-standing patterns of lower persistence and graduation rates and post-graduation earnings among students from historically underrepresented groups, especially ethnic and racial minorities and first-generation college students [ 17]. Empirical insights into how these gaps develop throughout students\u2019 college experience can advance our theoretical understanding of inequities and inform academic policies to better support students.

The debate is whether the experiment would have detected the phenomenon of interest if it was there.\n\nThe argument from ignorance for \"absence of evidence\" isn't necessarily fallacious, for example, that a potentially life saving new drug poses no long term health risk unless proved otherwise. On the other hand, were such an argument to rely imprudently on the \"lack\" of research to promote its conclusion, it would be considered an informal fallacy whereas the former can be a persuasive way to shift the burden of proof in an argument or debate. Carl Sagan criticized such \"impatience with ambiguity\" with cosmologist Martin Rees' maxim, \"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\".\n\nIn carefully designed scientific experiments, even null results can be evidence of absence. For instance, a hypothesis may be falsified if a vital predicted observation is not found empirically.

Towards the end of May, he traveled to Hong Kong. Greenwald, Poitras and the Guardian's defence and intelligence correspondent Ewen MacAskill flew to Hong Kong to meet Snowden.\n\nAfter the U.S.-based editor of \"The Guardian\", Janine Gibson, held several meetings in New York City, she decided that Greenwald, Poitras and the \"Guardian\"s defence and intelligence", "From 2001 to 2011, the NSA collected vast amounts of metadata records detailing the email and internet usage of Americans via Stellar Wind, which was later terminated due to operational and resource constraints. It was subsequently replaced by newer surveillance programs such as ShellTrumpet, which \"\"processed its one trillionth metadata record\"\" by the end of December 2012.\nAccording to Boundless Informant, over 97 billion pieces of intelligence were collected over a 30-day period ending in March 2013. Out of all 97 billion sets of information, about 3 billion data sets originated from U.S. computer networks and around 500 million metadata records were collected from German networks.\nIn December 2012 alone, the BND handed over 500 million metadata records to the NSA.\nIn a document dated January 2013, the NSA acknowledged the efforts of the BND to undermine privacy laws:\nAccording to an NSA document dated April 2013, Germany has now become the NSA's \"most prolific partner\".", "Section::::Timeline.:2013.:October.\nOn October 4, 2013, \"The Washington Post\" and \"The Guardian\" jointly reported that the NSA and GCHQ had made repeated attempts to spy on anonymous Internet users who have been communicating in secret via the anonymity network Tor. Several of these surveillance operations involved the implantation of malicious code into the computers of Tor users who visit particular websites. The NSA and GCHQ had partly succeeded in blocking access to the anonymous network, diverting Tor users to insecure channels. The government agencies were also able to uncover the identity of some anonymous Internet users.\nThe Communications Security Establishment (CSE) has been using a program called Olympia to map the communications of Brazil's Mines and Energy Ministry by targeting the metadata of phone calls and emails to and from the ministry.\nThe Australian Federal Government knew about the PRISM surveillance program months before Edward Snowden made details public.\nThe NSA gathered hundreds of millions of contact lists from personal e-mail and instant messaging accounts around the world. The agency did not target individuals. Instead it collected contact lists in large numbers that amount to a sizable fraction of the world's e-mail and instant messaging accounts. Analysis of that data enables the agency to search for hidden connections and to map relationships within a much smaller universe of foreign intelligence targets.\nThe NSA monitored the public email account of former Mexican president Felipe Calder\u00f3n (thus gaining access to the communications of high-ranking cabinet members), the emails of several high-ranking members of Mexico's security forces and text and the mobile phone communication of current Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. The NSA tries to gather cellular and landline phone numbers\u2014often obtained from American diplomats\u2014for as many foreign officials as possible. The contents of the phone calls are stored in computer databases that can regularly be searched using keywords.\nThe NSA has been monitoring telephone conversations of 35 world leaders. The U.S. government's first public acknowledgment that it tapped the phones of world leaders was reported on October 28, 2013, by the Wall Street Journal after an internal U.S. government review turned up NSA monitoring of some 35 world leaders. GCHQ has tried to keep its mass surveillance program a secret because it feared a \"damaging public debate\" on the scale of its activities which could lead to legal challenges against them.\n\"The Guardian\" revealed that the NSA had been monitoring telephone conversations of 35 world leaders after being given the numbers by an official in another U.S. government department. A confidential memo revealed that the NSA encouraged senior officials in such Departments as the White House, State and The Pentagon, to share their \"Rolodexes\" so the agency could add the telephone numbers of leading foreign politicians to their surveillance systems. Reacting to the news, German leader Angela Merkel, arriving in Brussels for an EU summit, accused the U.S. of a breach of trust, saying: \"We need to have trust in our allies and partners, and this must now be established once again. I repeat that spying among friends is not at all acceptable against anyone, and that goes for every citizen in Germany.\" The NSA collected in 2010 data on ordinary Americans' cellphone locations, but later discontinued it because it had no \"operational value.\"\nUnder Britain's MUSCULAR programme, the NSA and GCHQ have secretly broken into the main communications links that connect Yahoo and Google data centers around the world and thereby gained the ability to collect metadata and content at will from hundreds of millions of user accounts.\nThe mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel might have been tapped by U.S. intelligence. According to the Spiegel this monitoring goes back to 2002 and ended in the summer of 2013, while \"The New York Times\" reported that Germany has evidence that the NSA's surveillance of Merkel began during George W. Bush's tenure. After learning from \"Der Spiegel\" magazine that the NSA has been listening in to her personal mobile phone, Merkel compared the snooping practices of the NSA with those of the Stasi. It was reported in March 2014, by Der Spiegel that Merkel had also been placed on an NSA surveillance list alongside 122 other world leaders.\nOn October 31, 2013, Hans-Christian Str\u00f6bele, a member of the German Bundestag, met Snowden in Moscow and revealed the former intelligence contractor's readiness to brief the German government on NSA spying.\nA highly sensitive signals intelligence collection program known as Stateroom involves the interception of radio, telecommunications and internet traffic. It is operated out of the diplomatic missions of the Five Eyes (Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, United States) in numerous locations around the world. The program conducted at U.S. diplomatic missions is run in concert by the U.S. intelligence agencies NSA and CIA in a joint venture group called \"Special Collection Service\" (SCS), whose members work undercover in shielded areas of the American Embassies and Consulates, where they are officially accredited as diplomats and as such enjoy special privileges. Under diplomatic protection, they are able to look and listen unhindered. The SCS for example used the American Embassy near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to monitor communications in Germany's government district with its parliament and the seat of the government.\nUnder the Stateroom surveillance programme, Australia operates clandestine surveillance facilities to intercept phone calls and data across much of Asia.\nIn France, the NSA targeted people belonging to the worlds of business, politics or French state administration. The NSA monitored and recorded the content of telephone communications and the history of the connections of each target i.e. the metadata. The actual surveillance operation was performed by French intelligence agencies on behalf of the NSA. The cooperation between France and the NSA was confirmed by the Director of the NSA, Keith B. Alexander, who asserted that foreign intelligence services collected phone records in \"war zones\" and \"other areas outside their borders\" and provided them to the NSA.\nThe French newspaper \"Le Monde\" also disclosed new PRISM and Upstream slides (See Page 4, 7 and 8) coming from the \"PRISM/US-984XN Overview\" presentation.\nIn Spain, the NSA intercepted the telephone conversations, text messages and emails of millions of Spaniards, and spied on members of the Spanish government. Between December 10, 2012 and January 8, 2013, the NSA collected metadata on 60 million telephone calls in Spain.\nAccording to documents leaked by Snowden, the surveillance of Spanish citizens was jointly conducted by the NSA and the intelligence agencies of Spain.\nSection::::Timeline.:2013.:November.\n\"The New York Times\" reported that the NSA carries out an eavesdropping effort, dubbed Operation Dreadnought, against the Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. During his 2009 visit to Iranian Kurdistan, the agency collaborated with GCHQ and the U.S.'s National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, collecting radio transmissions between aircraft and airports, examining Khamenei's convoy with satellite imagery, and enumerating military radar stations. According to the story, an objective of the operation is \"communications fingerprinting\": the ability to distinguish Khamenei's communications from those of other people in Iran.\nThe same story revealed an operation code-named Ironavenger, in which the NSA intercepted e-mails sent between a country allied with the United States and the government of \"an adversary\". The ally was conducting a spear-phishing attack: its e-mails contained malware. The NSA gathered documents and login credentials belonging to the enemy country, along with knowledge of the ally's capabilities for attacking computers.\nAccording to the British newspaper \"The Independent\", the British intelligence agency GCHQ maintains a listening post on the roof of the British Embassy in Berlin that is capable of intercepting mobile phone calls, wi-fi data and long-distance communications all over the German capital, including adjacent government buildings such as the Reichstag (seat of the German parliament) and the Chancellery (seat of Germany's head of government) clustered around the Brandenburg Gate.\nOperating under the code-name \"Quantum Insert\", GCHQ set up a fake website masquerading as LinkedIn, a social website used for professional networking, as part of its efforts to install surveillance software on the computers of the telecommunications operator Belgacom. In addition, the headquarters of the oil cartel OPEC were infiltrated by GCHQ as well as the NSA, which bugged the computers of nine OPEC employees and monitored the General Secretary of OPEC.\nFor more than three years GCHQ has been using an automated monitoring system code-named \"Royal Concierge\" to infiltrate the reservation systems of at least 350 prestigious hotels in many different parts of the world in order to target, search and analyze reservations to detect diplomats and government officials. First tested in 2010, the aim of the \"Royal Concierge\" is to track down the travel plans of diplomats, and it is often supplemented with surveillance methods related to human intelligence (HUMINT). Other covert operations include the wiretapping of room telephones and fax machines used in targeted hotels as well as the monitoring of computers hooked up to the hotel network.\nIn November 2013, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and \"The Guardian\" revealed that the Australian Signals Directorate (DSD) had attempted to listen to the private phone calls of the president of Indonesia and his wife. The Indonesian foreign minister, Marty Natalegawa, confirmed that he and the president had contacted the ambassador in Canberra. Natalegawa said any tapping of Indonesian politicians' personal phones \"violates every single decent and legal instrument I can think of\u2014national in Indonesia, national in Australia, international as well\".", "::::Timeline.:2014.:February.\nAccording to research by \"S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\" and TV network NDR the mobile phone of former German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was monitored from 2002 onwards, reportedly because of his government's opposition to military intervention in Iraq. The source of the latest information is a document leaked by Edward Snowden. The document, containing information about the National Sigint Requirement List (NSRL), had previously been interpreted as referring only to Angela Merkel's mobile. However \"S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\" and NDR claim to have confirmation from NSA insiders that the surveillance authorisation pertains not to the individual, but the political post \u2013 which in 2002 was still held by Schr\u00f6der. According to research by the two media outlets, Schr\u00f6der was placed as number 388 on the list, which contains the names of persons and institutions to be put under surveillance by the NSA.\nGCHQ launched a cyber-attack on the activist network \"Anonymous\", using denial-of-service attack (DoS) to shut down a chatroom frequented by the network's members and to spy on them. The attack, dubbed Rolling Thunder, was conducted by a GCHQ unit known as the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG). The unit successfully uncovered the true identities of several Anonymous members.\nThe NSA Section 215 bulk telephony metadata program which seeks to stockpile records on all calls made in the U.S. is collecting less than 30 percent of all Americans' call records because of an inability to keep pace with the explosion in cellphone use according to the Washington Post. The controversial program permits the NSA after a warrant granted by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to record numbers, length and location of every call from the participating carriers.\n\"The Intercept\" reported that the U.S. government is using primarily NSA surveillance to target people for drone strikes overseas. In its report \"The Intercept\" author detail the flawed methods which are used to locate targets for lethal drone strikes, resulting in the deaths of innocent people. According to the Washington Post NSA analysts and collectors i.e. NSA personnel which controls electronic surveillance equipment use the NSA's sophisticated surveillance capabilities to track individual targets geographically and in real time, while drones and tactical units aimed their weaponry against those targets to take them out.\nAn unnamed US law firm, reported to be Mayer Brown, was targeted by Australia's ASD. According to Snowden's documents, the ASD had offered to hand over these intercepted communications to the NSA. This allowed government authorities to be \"able to continue to cover the talks, providing highly useful intelligence for interested US customers\".\nNSA and GCHQ documents revealed that the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks and other activist groups were targeted for government surveillance and criminal prosecution. In particular, the IP addresses of visitors to WikiLeaks were collected in real time, and the US government urged its allies to file criminal charges against the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, due to his organization's publication of the Afghanistan war logs. The WikiLeaks organization was designated as a \"malicious foreign actor\".\nQuoting an unnamed NSA official in Germany, \"Bild am Sonntag\" reported that whilst President Obama's order to stop spying on Merkel was being obeyed, the focus had shifted to bugging other leading government and business figures including Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, a close confidant of Merkel. Caitlin Hayden, a security adviser to President Obama, was quoted in the newspaper report as saying, \"The US has made clear it gathers intelligence in exactly the same way as any other states.\"\n\"The Intercept\" reveals that government agencies are infiltrating online communities and engaging in \"false flag operations\" to discredit targets among them people who have nothing to do with terrorism or national security threats. The two main tactics that are currently used are the injection of all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and the use of social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable.\nThe Guardian reported that Britain's surveillance agency GCHQ, with aid from the National Security Agency, intercepted and stored the webcam images of millions of internet users not suspected of wrongdoing. The surveillance program codenamed Optic Nerve collected still images of Yahoo webcam chats (one image every five minutes) in bulk and saved them to agency databases. The agency discovered \"that a surprising number of people use webcam conversations to show intimate parts of their body to the other person\", estimating that between 3% and 11% of the Yahoo webcam imagery harvested by GCHQ contains \"undesirable nudity\".\nSection::::Timeline.:2014.:March.\nThe NSA has built an infrastructure which enables it to covertly hack into computers on a mass scale by using automated systems that reduce the level of human oversight in the process. The NSA relies on an automated system codenamed TURBINE which in essence enables the automated management and control of a large network of implants (a form of remotely transmitted malware on selected individual computer devices or in bulk on tens of thousands of devices). As quoted by \"The Intercept\", TURBINE is designed to \"allow the current implant network to scale to large size (millions of implants) by creating a system that does automated control implants by groups instead of individually.\" The NSA has shared many of its files on the use of implants with its counterparts in the so-called Five Eyes surveillance alliance \u2013 the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.\nAmong other things due to TURBINE and its control over the implants the NSA is capable of:\nBULLET::::- breaking into targeted computers and to siphoning out data from foreign Internet and phone networks\nBULLET::::- infecting a target's computer and exfiltrating files from a hard drive\nBULLET::::- covertly recording audio from a computer's microphone and taking snapshots with its webcam\nBULLET::::- launching cyberattacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying access to websites\nBULLET::::- exfiltrating data from removable flash drives that connect to an infected computer\nThe TURBINE implants are linked to, and relies upon, a large network of clandestine surveillance \"sensors\" that the NSA has installed at locations across the world, including the agency's headquarters in Maryland and eavesdropping bases used by the agency in Misawa, Japan and Menwith Hill, England. Codenamed as TURMOIL, the sensors operate as a sort of high-tech surveillance dragnet, monitoring packets of data as they are sent across the Internet. When TURBINE implants exfiltrate data from infected computer systems, the TURMOIL sensors automatically identify the data and return it to the NSA for analysis. And when targets are communicating, the TURMOIL system can be used to send alerts or \"tips\" to TURBINE, enabling the initiation of a malware attack. To identify surveillance targets, the NSA uses a series of data \"selectors\" as they flow across Internet cables. These selectors can include email addresses, IP addresses, or the unique \"cookies\" containing a username or other identifying information that are sent to a user's computer by websites such as Google, Facebook, Hotmail, Yahoo, and Twitter, unique Google advertising cookies that track browsing habits, unique encryption key fingerprints that can be traced to a specific user, and computer IDs that are sent across the Internet when a Windows computer crashes or updates.\nThe CIA was accused by U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein of spying on a stand-alone computer network established for the committee in its investigation of allegations of CIA abuse in a George W. Bush-era detention and interrogation program.\nA voice interception program codenamed MYSTIC began in 2009. Along with RETRO, short for \"retrospective retrieval\" (RETRO is voice audio recording buffer that allows retrieval of captured content up to 30 days into the past), the MYSTIC program is capable of recording \"100 percent\" of a foreign country's telephone calls, enabling the NSA to rewind and review conversations up to 30 days and the relating metadata. With the capability to store up to 30 days of recorded conversations MYSTIC enables the NSA to pull an instant history of the person's movements, associates and plans.\nOn March 21, \"Le Monde\" published slides from an internal presentation of the Communications Security Establishment Canada, which attributed a piece of malicious software to French intelligence. The CSEC presentation concluded that the list of malware victims matched French intelligence priorities and found French cultural reference in the malware's code, including the name Babar, a popular French children's character, and the developer name \"Titi\".\nThe French telecommunications corporation Orange S.A. shares its call data with the French intelligence agency DGSE, which hands over the intercepted data to GCHQ.\nThe NSA has spied on the Chinese technology company Huawei. Huawei is a leading manufacturer of smartphones, tablets, mobile phone infrastructure, and WLAN routers and installs fiber optic cable. According to \"Der Spiegel\" this \"kind of technology [\u2026] is decisive in the NSA's battle for data supremacy.\" The NSA, in an operation named \"Shotgiant\", was able to access Huawei's email archive and the source code for Huawei's communications products. The US government has had longstanding concerns that Huawei may not be independent of the People's Liberation Army and that the Chinese government might use equipment manufactured by Huawei to conduct cyberespionage or cyberwarfare. The goals of the NSA operation were to assess the relationship between Huawei and the PLA, to learn more the Chinese government's plans and to use information from Huawei to spy on Huawei's customers, including...", "Section::::Timeline.:2014.:April.\nTowards the end of April, Edward Snowden said that the United States surveillance agencies spy on Americans more than anyone else in the world, contrary to anything that has been said by the government up until this point.\nSection::::Timeline.:2014.:May.\nAn article published by Ars Technica shows NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) employees intercepting a Cisco router.\n\"The Intercept\" and WikiLeaks revealed information about which countries were having their communications collected as part of the MYSTIC surveillance program. On May 19, \"The Intercept\" reported that the NSA is recording and archiving nearly every cell phone conversation in the Bahamas with a system called SOMALGET, a subprogram of MYSTIC. The mass surveillance has been occurring without the Bahamian government's permission. Aside from the Bahamas, \"The Intercept\" reported NSA interception of cell phone metadata in Kenya, the Philippines, Mexico and a fifth country it did not name due to \"credible concerns that doing so could lead to increased violence.\" WikiLeaks released a statement on May 23 claiming that Afghanistan was the unnamed nation.\nIn a statement responding to the revelations, the NSA said \"the implication that NSA's foreign intelligence collection is arbitrary and unconstrained is false.\"\nThrough its global surveillance operations the NSA exploits the flood of images included in emails, text messages, social media, videoconferences and other communications to harvest millions of images. These images are then used by the NSA in sophisticated facial recognition programs to track suspected terrorists and other intelligence targets.\nSection::::Timeline.:2014.:June.\nVodafone revealed that there were secret wires that allowed government agencies direct access to their networks. This access does not require warrants and the direct access wire is often equipment in a locked room. In six countries where Vodafone operates, the law requires telecommunication companies to install such access or allows governments to do so. Vodafone did not name these countries in case some governments retaliated by imprisoning their staff. Shami Chakrabarti of Liberty said \"For governments to access phone calls at the flick of a switch is unprecedented and terrifying. Snowden revealed the internet was already treated as fair game. Bluster that all is well is wearing pretty thin \u2013 our analogue laws need a digital overhaul.\" Vodafone published its first Law Enforcement Disclosure Report on June 6, 2014. Vodafone group privacy officer Stephen Deadman said \"These pipes exist, the direct access model exists. We are making a call to end direct access as a means of government agencies obtaining people's communication data. Without an official warrant, there is no external visibility. If we receive a demand we can push back against the agency. The fact that a government has to issue a piece of paper is an important constraint on how powers are used.\" Gus Hosein, director of Privacy International said \"I never thought the telcos would be so complicit. It's a brave step by Vodafone and hopefully the other telcos will become more brave with disclosure, but what we need is for them to be braver about fighting back against the illegal requests and the laws themselves.\"\nAbove-top-secret documentation of a covert surveillance program named Overseas Processing Centre 1 (OPC-1) (codenamed \"CIRCUIT\") by GCHQ was published by \"The Register\". Based on documents leaked by Edward Snowden, GCHQ taps into undersea fiber optic cables via secret spy bases near the Strait of Hormuz and Yemen. BT and Vodafone are implicated.\nThe Danish newspaper \"Dagbladet Information\" and \"The Intercept\" revealed on June 19, 2014, the NSA mass surveillance program codenamed RAMPART-A. Under RAMPART-A, 'third party' countries tap into fiber optic cables carrying the majority of the world's electronic communications and are secretly allowing the NSA to install surveillance equipment on these fiber-optic cables. The foreign partners of the NSA turn massive amounts of data like the content of phone calls, faxes, e-mails, internet chats, data from virtual private networks, and calls made using Voice over IP software like Skype over to the NSA. In return these partners receive access to the NSA's sophisticated surveillance equipment so that they too can spy on the mass of data that flows in and out of their territory. Among the partners participating in the NSA mass surveillance program are Denmark and Germany.\nSection::::Timeline.:2014.:July.\nDuring the week of July 4, a 31-year-old male employee of Germany's intelligence service BND was arrested on suspicion of spying for the United States. The employee is suspected of spying on the German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal.\nFormer NSA official and whistleblower William Binney spoke at a Centre for Investigative Journalism conference in London. According to Binney, \"at least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US. The NSA lies about what it stores.\" He also stated that the majority of fiber optic cables run through the U.S., which \"is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in.\"\n\"The Washington Post\" released a review of a cache provided by Snowden containing roughly 160,000 text messages and e-mails intercepted by the NSA between 2009 and 2012. The newspaper concluded that nine out of ten account holders whose conversations were recorded by the agency \"were not the intended surveillance targets but were caught in a net the agency had cast for somebody else.\" In its analysis, \"The Post\" also noted that many of the account holders were Americans.\nOn July 9, a soldier working within Germany's Federal Ministry of Defence (BMVg) fell under suspicion of spying for the United States. As a result of the July 4 case and this one, the German government expelled the CIA station chief in Germany on July 17.\nOn July 18, former State Department official John Tye released an editorial in \"The Washington Post\", highlighting concerns over data collection under Executive Order 12333. Tye's concerns are rooted in classified material he had access to through the State Department, though he has not publicly released any classified materials.\nSection::::Timeline.:2014.:August.\n\"The Intercept\" reported that the NSA is \"secretly providing data to nearly two dozen U.S. government agencies with a 'Google-like' search engine\" called ICREACH. The database, \"The Intercept\" reported, is accessible to domestic law enforcement agencies including the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration and was built to contain more than 850 billion metadata records about phone calls, emails, cellphone locations, and text messages.\nSection::::Timeline.:2015.\nSection::::Timeline.:2015.:February.\nBased on documents obtained from Snowden, \"The Intercept\" reported that the NSA and GCHQ had broken into the internal computer network of Gemalto and stolen the encryption keys that are used in SIM cards no later than 2010. , the company is the world's largest manufacturer of SIM cards, making about two billion cards a year. With the keys, the intelligence agencies could eavesdrop on cell phones without the knowledge of mobile phone operators or foreign governments.\nSection::::Timeline.:2015.:March.\n\"The New Zealand Herald\", in partnership with \"The Intercept\", revealed that the New Zealand government used XKeyscore to spy on candidates for the position of World Trade Organization director general and also members of the Solomon Islands government.\nSection::::Timeline.:2015.:April.\nIn January 2015, the DEA revealed that it had been collecting metadata records for all telephone calls made by Americans to 116 countries linked to drug trafficking. The DEA's program was separate from the telephony metadata programs run by the NSA. In April, \"USA Today\" reported that the DEA's data collection program began in 1992 and included all telephone calls between the United States and from Canada and Mexico. Current and former DEA officials described the program as the precursor of the NSA's similar programs. The DEA said its program was suspended in September 2013, after a review of the NSA's programs and that it was \"ultimately terminated.\"\nSection::::Timeline.:2015.:September.\nSnowden provided journalists at \"The Intercept\" with GCHQ documents regarding another secret program \"Karma Police\", calling itself \"the world's biggest\" data mining operation, formed to create profiles on every visible Internet user's browsing habits. By 2009 it had stored over 1.1 trillion web browsing sessions, and by 2012 was recording 50 billion sessions per day.\nSection::::Timeline.:2016.", "Section::::Timeline.:2016.:January.\nBULLET::::- NSA documents show the US and UK spied on Israeli military drones and fighter jets.\nSection::::Timeline.:2016.:August.\nBULLET::::- A group called \"The Shadow Brokers\" says it infiltrated NSA's Equation Group and teases files including some named in documents leaked by Edward Snowden.

For the main analysis, we aggregate the procrastination score to the student-course level by averaging over assignments in a course: \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50 = 1 / |\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc50| \u2211 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50 (2) where \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc50 = {\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc50} is the set of all assignments in course \ud835\udc50 and |\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc50| is the count of these assignments."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-347128": 1, "wikipedia-4529537": 1, "wikipedia-45482242": 1, "wikipedia-391421": 1, "wikipedia-18381194": 1, "wikipedia-1107567": 1, "wikipedia-11973292": 1, "wikipedia-34453685": 1, "wikipedia-17570": 1, "wikipedia-50004273": 1, "arxiv-2212.09914": 1, "arxiv-1704.00704": 1, "arxiv-2411.14559": 1, "arxiv-2412.11933": 1, "arxiv-1111.5161": 1, "arxiv-2309.15007": 1, "arxiv-2006.10174": 1, "arxiv-1112.4548": 1, "arxiv-2310.11571": 1, "arxiv-1408.3344": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/19": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/13": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/10": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/25": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/15": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/20": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/3": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-347128": 1, "wikipedia-4529537": 1, "wikipedia-45482242": 1, "wikipedia-391421": 2, "wikipedia-18381194": 1, "wikipedia-1107567": 2, "wikipedia-11973292": 2, "wikipedia-34453685": 2, "wikipedia-17570": 2, "wikipedia-50004273": 1, "arxiv-2212.09914": 1, "arxiv-1704.00704": 1, "arxiv-2411.14559": 1, "arxiv-2412.11933": 1, "arxiv-1111.5161": 1, "arxiv-2309.15007": 1, "arxiv-2006.10174": 1, "arxiv-1112.4548": 1, "arxiv-2310.11571": 1, "arxiv-1408.3344": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/19": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/13": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/10": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/25": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/15": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/20": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/3": 1}}}

In one study, college students were asked to indicate how many hours they planned to spend on various activities, such as studying, attending classes, exercising, etc. during a week in the near future (next week) or a week in the distant future (a week occurring a few months later). When planning for the near future, students' estimates of how much time they would spend on each activity took into account the fact that time spent on one activity would come at the expense of time spent on another (e.g., time spend exercising might come at the expense of time spent studying). However, when planning for the distant future, students' estimates of how much time they would spend on different activities didn't take these practical limitations into account, and they planned activities as though they had unlimited time and resources. According to the researchers, time constraints and conflicts between activities are factors affecting the feasibility of the activity and are thus low level and more likely to be the focus of near future planning.

According to Sternberg, these couples will continue to have great sex fifteen years or more into the relationship, they cannot imagine themselves happier over the long-term with anyone else, they overcome their few difficulties gracefully, and each delight in the relationship with one other. However, Sternberg cautions that maintaining a consummate love may be even harder than achieving it. He stresses the importance of translating the components of love into action. \"Without expression,\" he warns, \"even the greatest of loves can die.\" Thus, consummate love may not be permanent. If passion is lost over time, it may change into companionate love. Consummate love is the most satisfying kind of adult relation because it combines all pieces of the triangle into this one type of love. It is the ideal kind of relationship.

Specifically, sex is coded as binary (male/female); first-generation college student is a binary indicator of whether both parents did not complete a bachelor\u2019s degree; underrepresented minority (URM) student is a binary indicator of whether a student is a U.S. citizen who identifies as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, or Native American; race and ethnicity is coded categorically."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-59359901": 1, "wikipedia-56970574": 1, "wikipedia-42338427": 1, "wikipedia-7299728": 1, "wikipedia-40929586": 1, "wikipedia-696464": 1, "wikipedia-511197": 1, "wikipedia-171306": 1, "wikipedia-38250354": 1, "wikipedia-54638010": 1, "arxiv-1704.00959": 1, "arxiv-2310.13673": 1, "arxiv-1905.09947": 1, "arxiv-2404.01085": 1, "arxiv-1901.10578": 1, "arxiv-2302.14649": 1, "arxiv-1306.1365": 1, "arxiv-2007.10436": 1, "arxiv-2501.15985": 1, "arxiv-2208.07918": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/20": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/32": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/24": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/13": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/10": 2}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-59359901": 1, "wikipedia-56970574": 2, "wikipedia-42338427": 1, "wikipedia-7299728": 1, "wikipedia-40929586": 1, "wikipedia-696464": 2, "wikipedia-511197": 1, "wikipedia-171306": 1, "wikipedia-38250354": 1, "wikipedia-54638010": 1, "arxiv-1704.00959": 1, "arxiv-2310.13673": 2, "arxiv-1905.09947": 1, "arxiv-2404.01085": 2, "arxiv-1901.10578": 1, "arxiv-2302.14649": 1, "arxiv-1306.1365": 1, "arxiv-2007.10436": 1, "arxiv-2501.15985": 1, "arxiv-2208.07918": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/8": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/30": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/28": 3, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/20": 2, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/32": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/24": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/13": 1, "paper/47/3491140.3528285.jsonl/10": 3}}}
