The query can be partially answered using Wikipedia content. Wikipedia's \"k-means clustering\" page covers the basic steps of the algorithm, including initialization, assignment, and update steps. However, while it mentions methods like the elbow method for choosing the number of clusters, it may not provide in-depth details on projecting documents into higher-dimensional spaces (e.g., using PCA or t-SNE). For a comprehensive understanding, additional sources might be needed.", "wikipedia-22324566": ["Determining the number of clusters in a data set, a quantity often labelled \"k\" as in the \"k\"-means algorithm, is a frequent problem in data clustering, and is a distinct issue from the process of actually solving the clustering problem.\nFor a certain class of clustering algorithms (in particular \"k\"-means, \"k\"-medoids and expectation\u2013maximization algorithm), there is a parameter commonly referred to as \"k\" that specifies the number of clusters to detect. Other algorithms such as DBSCAN and OPTICS algorithm do not require the specification of this parameter; hierarchical clustering avoids the problem altogether.\nThe correct choice of \"k\" is often ambiguous, with interpretations depending on the shape and scale of the distribution of points in a data set and the desired clustering resolution of the user. In addition, increasing \"k\" without penalty will always reduce the amount of error in the resulting clustering, to the extreme case of zero error if each data point is considered its own cluster (i.e., when \"k\" equals the number of data points, \"n\"). Intuitively then, \"the optimal choice of \"k\" will strike a balance between maximum compression of the data using a single cluster, and maximum accuracy by assigning each data point to its own cluster\". If an appropriate value of \"k\" is not apparent from prior knowledge of the properties of the data set, it must be chosen somehow. There are several categories of methods for making this decision.\nSection::::The elbow method.\nThe elbow method looks at the percentage of variance explained as a function of the number of clusters:\nOne should choose a number of clusters so that adding another cluster doesn't give much better modeling of the data.\nMore precisely, if one plots the percentage of variance explained by the clusters against the number of clusters, the first clusters will add much information (explain a lot of variance), but at some point the marginal gain will drop, giving an angle in the graph. The number of clusters is chosen at this point, hence the \"elbow criterion\".\nThis \"elbow\" cannot always be unambiguously identified.\nPercentage of variance explained is the ratio of the between-group variance to the total variance, also known as an F-test. A slight variation of this method plots the curvature of the within group variance.\nThe method can be traced to speculation by Robert L. Thorndike in 1953.\nSection::::X-means clustering.\nIn statistics and data mining, X-means clustering is a variation of k-means clustering that refines cluster assignments by repeatedly attempting subdivision, and keeping the best resulting splits, until a criterion such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is reached.\nSection::::Information criterion approach.\nAnother set of methods for determining the number of clusters are information criteria, such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), or the Deviance information criterion (DIC) \u2014 if it is possible to make a likelihood function for the clustering model. \nFor example: The \"k\"-means model is \"almost\" a Gaussian mixture model and one can construct a likelihood for the Gaussian mixture model and thus also determine information criterion values.\nSection::::An information\u2013theoretic approach.\nRate distortion theory has been applied to choosing \"k\" called the \"jump\" method, which determines the number of clusters that maximizes efficiency while minimizing error by information-theoretic standards. The strategy of the algorithm is to generate a distortion curve for the input data by running a standard clustering algorithm such as k-means for all values of \"k\" between 1 and \"n\", and computing the distortion (described below) of the resulting clustering. The distortion curve is then transformed by a negative power chosen based on the dimensionality of the data. Jumps in the resulting values then signify reasonable choices for \"k\", with the largest jump representing the best choice.\nThe distortion of a clustering of some input data is formally defined as follows: Let the data set be modeled as a \"p\"-dimensional random variable, \"X\", consisting of a mixture distribution of \"G\" components with common covariance, . If we let formula_1 be a set of \"K\" cluster centers, with formula_2 the closest center to a given sample of \"X\", then the minimum average distortion per dimension when fitting the \"K\" centers to the data is:\nThis is also the average Mahalanobis distance per dimension between \"X\" and the set of cluster centers \"C\". Because the minimization over all possible sets of cluster centers is prohibitively complex, the distortion is computed in practice by generating a set of cluster centers using a standard clustering algorithm and computing the distortion using the result. The pseudo-code for the jump method with an input set of \"p\"-dimensional data points \"X\" is:\nThe choice of the transform power formula_4 is motivated by asymptotic reasoning using results from rate distortion theory. Let the data \"X\" have a single, arbitrarily \"p\"-dimensional Gaussian distribution, and let fixed formula_5, for some greater than zero. Then the distortion of a clustering of \"K\" clusters in the limit as \"p\" goes to infinity is formula_6. It can be seen that asymptotically, the distortion of a clustering to the power formula_7 is proportional to formula_8, which by definition is approximately the number of clusters \"K\". In other words, for a single Gaussian distribution, increasing \"K\" beyond the true number of clusters, which should be one, causes a linear growth in distortion. This behavior is important in the general case of a mixture of multiple distribution components.\nLet \"X\" be a mixture of \"G\" \"p\"-dimensional Gaussian distributions with common covariance. Then for any fixed \"K\" less than \"G\", the distortion of a clustering as \"p\" goes to infinity is infinite. Intuitively, this means that a clustering of less than the correct number of clusters is unable to describe asymptotically high-dimensional data, causing the distortion to increase without limit. If, as described above, \"K\" is made an increasing function of \"p\", namely, formula_5, the same result as above is achieved, with the value of the distortion in the limit as \"p\" goes to infinity being equal to formula_10. Correspondingly, there is the same proportional relationship between the transformed distortion and the number of clusters, \"K\".\nPutting the results above together, it can be seen that for sufficiently high values of \"p\", the transformed distortion formula_11 is approximately zero for \"K\"  \"G\", then jumps suddenly and begins increasing linearly for \"K\" \u2265 \"G\". The jump algorithm for choosing \"K\" makes use of these behaviors to identify the most likely value for the true number of clusters.\nAlthough the mathematical support for the method is given in terms of asymptotic results, the algorithm has been empirically verified to work well in a variety of data sets with reasonable dimensionality. In addition to the localized jump method described above, there exists a second algorithm for choosing \"K\" using the same transformed distortion values known as the broken line method. The broken line method identifies the jump point in the graph of the transformed distortion by doing a simple least squares error line fit of two line segments, which in theory will fall along the \"x\"-axis for \"K\" < \"G\", and along the linearly increasing phase of the transformed distortion plot for \"K\" \u2265 \"G\". The broken line method is more robust than the jump method in that its decision is global rather than local, but it also relies on the assumption of Gaussian mixture components, whereas the jump method is fully non-parametric and has been shown to be viable for general mixture distributions.\nSection::::The silhouette method.\nThe average silhouette of the data is another useful criterion for assessing the natural number of clusters. The silhouette of a data instance is a measure of how closely it is matched to data within its cluster and how loosely it is matched to data of the neighbouring cluster, i.e. the cluster whose average distance from the datum is lowest. A silhouette close to 1 implies the datum is in an appropriate cluster, while a silhouette close to \u22121 implies the datum is in the wrong cluster. Optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms are useful in determining the number of clusters that gives rise to the largest silhouette.\nIt is also possible to re-scale the data in such a way that the silhouette is more likely to be maximised at the correct number of clusters.\nSection::::Cross-validation.\nOne can also use the process of cross-validation to analyze the number of clusters. In this process, the data is partitioned into \"v\" parts. Each of the parts is then set aside at turn as a test set, a clustering model computed on the other \"v\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 training sets, and the value of the objective function (for example, the sum of the squared distances to the centroids for \"k\"-means) calculated for the test set. These \"v\" values are calculated and averaged for each alternative number of clusters, and the cluster number selected such that further increase in number of clusters leads to only a small reduction in the objective function. \nSection::::Finding number of clusters in text databases.\nIn text databases, a document collection defined by a document by term D matrix (of size m by n, m: number of documents, n: number of terms) number of clusters can roughly be estimated by the following formula \nformula_12\nwhere t is"], "wikipedia-38870173": ["Section::::Unsupervised.:\"K\"-means clustering.\n\"K\"-means clustering is an approach for vector quantization. In particular, given a set of \"n\" vectors, \"k\"-means clustering groups them into k clusters (i.e., subsets) in such a way that each vector belongs to the cluster with the closest mean. The problem is computationally NP-hard, although suboptimal greedy algorithms have been developed.\nK-means clustering can be used to group an unlabeled set of inputs into \"k\" clusters, and then use the centroids of these clusters to produce features. These features can be produced in several ways. The simplest is to add \"k\" binary features to each sample, where each feature \"j\" has value one iff the \"j\"th centroid learned by \"k\"-means is the closest to the sample under consideration. It is also possible to use the distances to the clusters as features, perhaps after transforming them through a radial basis function (a technique that has been used to train RBF networks). Coates and Ng note that certain variants of \"k\"-means behave similarly to sparse coding algorithms."], "wikipedia-58475368": ["Automated selection of \"k\" in a \"K\"-means clustering algorithm, one of the most used centroid-based clustering algorithms, is still a major problem in machine learning. The most accepted solution to this problem is the elbow method. It consists of running \"k\"-means clustering to the data set with a range of values, calculating the sum of squared errors for each, and plotting them in a line chart. If the chart looks like an arm, the best value of \"k\" will be on the \"elbow\".\n\nAnother method that modifies the \"k\"-means algorithm for automatically choosing the optimal number of clusters is the \"G\"-means algorithm. It was developed from the hypothesis that a subset of the data follows a Gaussian distribution. Thus, \"k\" is increased until each \"k\"-means center's data is Gaussian. This algorithm only requires the standard statistical significance level as a parameter and does not set limits for the covariance of the data."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier, or, more commonly, for dimensionality reduction before later classification.\n\nLDA is closely related to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis, which also attempt to express one dependent variable as a linear combination of other features or measurements. However, ANOVA uses categorical independent variables and a continuous dependent variable, whereas discriminant analysis has continuous independent variables and a categorical dependent variable (\"i.e.\" the class label). Logistic regression and probit regression are more similar to LDA than ANOVA is, as they also explain a categorical variable by the values of continuous independent variables. These other methods are preferable in applications where it is not reasonable to assume that the independent variables are normally distributed, which is a fundamental assumption of the LDA method.\n\nLDA is also closely related to principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis in that they both look for linear combinations of variables which best explain the data. LDA explicitly attempts to model the difference between the classes of data. PCA on the other hand does not take into account any difference in class, and factor analysis builds the feature combinations based on differences rather than similarities. Discriminant analysis is also different from factor analysis in that it is not an interdependence technique: a distinction between independent variables and dependent variables (also called criterion variables) must be made.\n\nLDA works when the measurements made on independent variables for each observation are continuous quantities. When dealing with categorical independent variables, the equivalent technique is discriminant correspondence analysis.\n\nDiscriminant analysis is used when groups are known a priori (unlike in cluster analysis).

In brief, inK-means clustering an expected number of clusters, k, is chosen. Initiallyk documents are chosen as seeds, and each document in the collection is allocated to the cluster for which the seed is the nearest neighbour. At each subsequent iteration, the centroid of each cluster is computed; this is the average of the allocated documents. The documents are then allocated again to the cluster with the nearest centroid. This repeats until an iteration limit is reached or the process converges, that is, the clusters are unchanged between iterations. The value of k can be optimised by exploring behaviour as k is varied, for example with the Elbow method [27], but in this work we use fixedk based on results in the separate project mentioned above.\nThe concept of \u2018nearest neighbour\u2019 requires a document representation.

We therefore use we use K-means for the work in this paper. Although the robustness ofK-means has been questioned, for example with regard to stability and the potential to fall into local minima rather than produce globally optimal outcomes, in a separate project (manuscript in submission) we have observed reasonably stable performance. In brief, inK-means clustering an expected number of clusters, k, is chosen. Initiallyk documents are chosen as seeds, and each document in the collection is allocated to the cluster for which the seed is the nearest neighbour. At each subsequent iteration, the centroid of each cluster is computed; this is the average of the allocated documents. The documents are then allocated again to the cluster with the nearest centroid. This repeats until an iteration limit is reached or the process converges, that is, the clusters are unchanged between iterations. The value of k can be optimised by exploring behaviour as k is varied, for example with the Elbow method [27], but in this work we use fixedk based on results in the separate project mentioned above."], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": ["clustering, which partitions collections into subcollections with the expectation that the contents will be thematically linked"], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": ["In contrast to some of the work discussed above, in our research clusters are represented with keywords and are determined independently of consideration of topic models.\n\nKeywords from central documents (central keywords).

In contrast with other cluster analysis techniques, automatic clustering algorithms can determine the optimal number of clusters even in the presence of noise and outlier points.\n\nSection::::Centroid-based.\nGiven a set of \"n\" objects, centroid-based algorithms create \"k\" partitions based on a dissimilarity function, such that \"k\u2264n\". A major problem in applying this type of algorithm is determining the appropriate number of clusters for unlabeled data. Therefore, most research in clustering analysis has been focused on the automation of the process.\nAutomated selection of \"k\" in a \"K\"-means clustering algorithm, one of the most used centroid-based clustering algorithms, is still a major problem in machine learning. The most accepted solution to this problem is the elbow method. It consists of running \"k\"-means clustering to the data set with a range of values, calculating the sum of squared errors for each, and plotting them in a line chart. If the chart looks like an arm, the best value of \"k\" will be on the \"elbow\".\nAnother method that modifies the \"k\"-means algorithm for automatically choosing the optimal number of clusters is the \"G\"-means algorithm. It was developed from the hypothesis that a subset of the data follows a Gaussian distribution. Thus, \"k\" is increased until each \"k\"-means center's data is Gaussian. This algorithm only requires the standard statistical significance level as a parameter and does not set limits for the covariance of the data.\n\nSection::::Connectivity-based (Hierarchical clustering).\nConnectivity-based clustering or hierarchical clustering is based on the idea that objects have more similarities to other nearby objects than to those further away. Therefore, the generated clusters from this type of algorithm will be the result of the distance between the analyzed objects.\nHierarchical models can either be divisive, where partitions are built from the entire data set available, or agglomerating, where each partition begins with a single object and additional objects are added to the set. Although hierarchical clustering has the advantage of allowing any valid metric to be used as the defined distance, it is sensitive to noise and fluctuations in the data set and is more difficult to automate.\nMethods have been developed to improve and automate existing hierarchical clustering algorithms such as an automated version of single linkage hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). This computerized method bases its success on a self-consistent outlier reduction approach followed by the building of a descriptive function which permits defining natural clusters. Discarded objects can also be assigned to these clusters. Essentially, one needs not to resort to external parameters to identify natural clusters. Information gathered from HCA, automated and reliable, can be resumed in a dendrogram with the number of natural clusters and the corresponding separation, an option not found in classical HCA. This method includes the two following steps: outliers being removed (this is applied in many filtering applications) and an optional classification allowing expanding clusters with the whole set of objects.\nBIRCH (balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies) is an algorithm used to perform connectivity-based clustering for large data-sets. It is regarded as one of the fastest clustering algorithms, but it is limited its requirement of the number of clusters as input. Therefore, new algorithms based on BIRCH have been developed in which there is no need to provide the cluster count from the beginning, but that preserves the quality and speed of the clusters. The main modification is to remove the final step of BIRCH, where the user had to input the cluster count, and to improve the rest of the algorithm, referred to as tree-BIRCH, by optimizing a threshold parameter from the data. In this resulting algorithm, the threshold parameter is calculated from the maximum cluster radius and the minimum distance between clusters, which are often known. This method proved to be efficient for data sets of tens of thousands of clusters. If going beyond that amount, a supercluster splitting problem is introduced. For this, other algorithms have been developed, like MDB-BIRCH, which reduces super cluster splitting with relatively high speed.\n\nSection::::Density-based.\nUnlike partitioning and hierarchical methods, density-based clustering algorithms are able to find clusters of any arbitrary shape, not only spheres.\nThe density-based clustering algorithm uses autonomous machine learning that identifies patterns regarding geographical location and distance to a particular number of neighbors. It is considered autonomous because a priori knowledge on what is a cluster is not required. This type of algorithm provides different methods to find clusters in the data. The fastest method is DBSCAN, which uses a defined distance to differentiate between dense groups of information and sparser noise. Moreover, HDBSCAN can self-adjust by using a range of distances instead of a specified one. Lastly, the method OPTICS creates a reachability plot based on the distance from neighboring features to separate noise from clusters of varying density.\nThese methods still require the user to provide the cluster center and cannot be considered automatic. The Automatic Local Density Clustering Algorithm (ALDC) is an example of the new research focused on developing automatic density-based clustering. ALDC works out local density and distance deviation of every point, thus expanding the difference between the potential cluster center and other points. This expansion allows the machine to work automatically. The machine identifies cluster centers and assigns the points that are left by their closest neighbor of higher density.\nIn the automation of data density to identify clusters, research has also been focused on artificially generating the algorithms. For instance, the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms guarantees the generation of valid algorithms by the directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which nodes represent procedures (building block) and edges represent possible execution sequences between two nodes. Building Blocks determine the EDA's alphabet or, in other words, any generated algorithm. Clustering algorithms artificially generated are compared to DBSCAN, a manual algorithm, in experimental results."], "wikipedia-14448807": ["Fuzzy clustering by Local Approximation of MEmberships (FLAME) is a data clustering algorithm that defines clusters in the dense parts of a dataset and performs cluster assignment solely based on the neighborhood relationships among objects. The key feature of this algorithm is that the neighborhood relationships among neighboring objects in the feature space are used to constrain the memberships of neighboring objects in the fuzzy membership space.\nThe FLAME algorithm is mainly divided into three steps:\n1. Extraction of the structure information from the dataset:\n1. Construct a neighborhood graph to connect each object to its K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN);\n2.

The definition of 'shortest distance' is what differentiates between the different agglomerative clustering methods.\nIn single-linkage clustering, the distance between two clusters is determined by a single element pair, namely those two elements (one in each cluster) that are closest to each other.

Wikipedia provides detailed information on clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN) and their steps, such as initialization, iteration, and convergence, which address the intermediate processes from data collection to partitioning. Additionally, pages like \"Cluster analysis\" and specific algorithm articles explain key concepts like distance metrics, centroid calculation, and partitioning methods.", "wikipedia-58475368": ["Section::::Centroid-based.\nGiven a set of \"n\" objects, centroid-based algorithms create \"k\" partitions based on a dissimilarity function, such that \"k\u2264n\". A major problem in applying this type of algorithm is determining the appropriate number of clusters for unlabeled data. Therefore, most research in clustering analysis has been focused on the automation of the process.\nAutomated selection of \"k\" in a \"K\"-means clustering algorithm, one of the most used centroid-based clustering algorithms, is still a major problem in machine learning. The most accepted solution to this problem is the elbow method. It consists of running \"k\"-means clustering to the data set with a range of values, calculating the sum of squared errors for each, and plotting them in a line chart. If the chart looks like an arm, the best value of \"k\" will be on the \"elbow\".\nAnother method that modifies the \"k\"-means algorithm for automatically choosing the optimal number of clusters is the \"G\"-means algorithm. It was developed from the hypothesis that a subset of the data follows a Gaussian distribution. Thus, \"k\" is increased until each \"k\"-means center's data is Gaussian. This algorithm only requires the standard statistical significance level as a parameter and does not set limits for the covariance of the data.\nSection::::Connectivity-based (Hierarchical clustering).\nConnectivity-based clustering or hierarchical clustering is based on the idea that objects have more similarities to other nearby objects than to those further away. Therefore, the generated clusters from this type of algorithm will be the result of the distance between the analyzed objects.\nHierarchical models can either be divisive, where partitions are built from the entire data set available, or agglomerating, where each partition begins with a single object and additional objects are added to the set. Although hierarchical clustering has the advantage of allowing any valid metric to be used as the defined distance, it is sensitive to noise and fluctuations in the data set and is more difficult to automate.\nMethods have been developed to improve and automate existing hierarchical clustering algorithms such as an automated version of single linkage hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). This computerized method bases its success on a self-consistent outlier reduction approach followed by the building of a descriptive function which permits defining natural clusters. Discarded objects can also be assigned to these clusters. Essentially, one needs not to resort to external parameters to identify natural clusters. Information gathered from HCA, automated and reliable, can be resumed in a dendrogram with the number of natural clusters and the corresponding separation, an option not found in classical HCA. This method includes the two following steps: outliers being removed (this is applied in many filtering applications) and an optional classification allowing expanding clusters with the whole set of objects.\nBIRCH (balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies) is an algorithm used to perform connectivity-based clustering for large data-sets. It is regarded as one of the fastest clustering algorithms, but it is limited its requirement of the number of clusters as input. Therefore, new algorithms based on BIRCH have been developed in which there is no need to provide the cluster count from the beginning, but that preserves the quality and speed of the clusters. The main modification is to remove the final step of BIRCH, where the user had to input the cluster count, and to improve the rest of the algorithm, referred to as tree-BIRCH, by optimizing a threshold parameter from the data. In this resulting algorithm, the threshold parameter is calculated from the maximum cluster radius and the minimum distance between clusters, which are often known. This method proved to be efficient for data sets of tens of thousands of clusters. If going beyond that amount, a supercluster splitting problem is introduced. For this, other algorithms have been developed, like MDB-BIRCH, which reduces super cluster splitting with relatively high speed.\nSection::::Density-based.\nUnlike partitioning and hierarchical methods, density-based clustering algorithms are able to find clusters of any arbitrary shape, not only spheres.\nThe density-based clustering algorithm uses autonomous machine learning that identifies patterns regarding geographical location and distance to a particular number of neighbors. It is considered autonomous because a priori knowledge on what is a cluster is not required. This type of algorithm provides different methods to find clusters in the data. The fastest method is DBSCAN, which uses a defined distance to differentiate between dense groups of information and sparser noise. Moreover, HDBSCAN can self-adjust by using a range of distances instead of a specified one. Lastly, the method OPTICS creates a reachability plot based on the distance from neighboring features to separate noise from clusters of varying density.\nThese methods still require the user to provide the cluster center and cannot be considered automatic. The Automatic Local Density Clustering Algorithm (ALDC) is an example of the new research focused on developing automatic density-based clustering. ALDC works out local density and distance deviation of every point, thus expanding the difference between the potential cluster center and other points. This expansion allows the machine to work automatically. The machine identifies cluster centers and assigns the points that are left by their closest neighbor of higher density. \"\"\nIn the automation of data density to identify clusters, research has also been focused on artificially generating the algorithms. For instance, the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms guarantees the generation of valid by the directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which nodes represent procedures (building block) and edges represent possible execution sequences between two nodes. Building Blocks determine the EDA's alphabet or, in other words, any generated algorithm.

The notion of a \"cluster\" cannot be precisely defined, which is one of the reasons why there are so many clustering algorithms. There is a common denominator: a group of data objects. However, different researchers employ different cluster models, and for each of these cluster models again different algorithms can be given. The notion of a cluster, as found by different algorithms, varies significantly in its properties. Understanding these \"cluster models\" is key to understanding the differences between the various algorithms.

Relaxations of the complete connectivity requirement (a fraction of the edges can be missing) are known as quasi-cliques, as in the HCS clustering algorithm.\nBULLET::::- \"Signed graph models\": Every path in a signed graph has a sign from the product of the signs on the edges. Under the assumptions of balance theory, edges may change sign and result in a bifurcated graph. The weaker \"clusterability axiom\" (no cycle has exactly one negative edge) yields results with more than two clusters, or subgraphs with only positive edges.\nBULLET::::- \"s\": the most well known unsupervised neural network is the self-organizing map and these models can usually be characterized as similar to one or more of the above models, and including subspace models when neural networks implement a form of Principal Component Analysis or Independent Component Analysis.\n\nA \"clustering\" is essentially a set of such clusters, usually containing all objects in the data set.

Another outcome was that the results show that topics are useful for illuminating the structure of clusters, and vice versa, and suggest that there are limits to claims on how distinct different topics or clusters are from each other.

The obverse of this observation is that some topics can assist in description of many documents but never be dominant, which is a common feature of topic models. As a consequence \u2013 for the purposes of comparing clustering and topic modelling, at least \u2013 the effective number of topics is reduced. Another perspective on this observation is that clustering can create subcategories of documents that share a dominant topic, while topic modelling supplements clustering by identifying subtopics. Some clusters are a mix of topics, with no one topic well represented, and large clusters are less likely to have a strongly dominant topic than are small clusters.

A feature in some of these visualisations is that the dot-clouds are more crowded at the centre, just as a galaxy is dense in the middle and sparse at the edges.\nThe intuition the dot-cloud metaphor suggests is that there are some archetypal items (documents in this study) at the centre of each cluster that can stand as ideotypes for the whole. In the first of our two approaches to generating representative word lists, we assume that the documents that are closest to the centroid are a good proxy for the whole, so that word lists generated from those documents will be informative about the cluster.\nIn detail, the Cosine distance between each document in the cluster and the centroid is calculated. We select the top 10 documents closest to the centroid and pool them, and select the top (highest-weighted) N words as the representative keywords.\nKeywords by all documents of a cluster (cluster keywords). An alternative to using the documents that are close to the centre is to use them all. Intuitively, this is an appealing approach if the documents are reasonably homogeneous but \u2013 considering the dot-cloud metaphor again \u2013 the documents that are remote from the centroid may be on rare subjects and be distant from the other documents in the cluster. That is, they may dilute the topical integrity that might be observed closer to the cluster\u2019s centre. However, we thought this a useful alternative to explore.\nStraightforwardly, we determine the vector for a cluster as the average of all the vectors in the cluster \u2013 that is, we use the centroid. The top (highest-weighted) N words from the centroid are selected as the representative keywords, that is, we use elementary cluster labelling as described above."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Hierarchical clustering, and k-means clustering are widely used techniques in microarray analysis.\n\nSection::::Techniques.:Clustering.:Hierarchical clustering.\nHierarchical clustering is a statistical method for finding relatively homogeneous clusters. Hierarchical clustering consists of two separate phases. Initially, a distance matrix containing all the pairwise distances between the genes is calculated. Pearson\u2019s correlation and Spearman\u2019s correlation are often used as dissimilarity estimates, but other methods, like Manhattan distance or Euclidean distance, can also be applied. Given the number of distance measures available and their influence in the clustering algorithm results, several studies have compared and evaluated different distance measures for the clustering of microarray data, considering their intrinsic properties and robustness to noise. After calculation of the initial distance matrix, the hierarchical clustering algorithm either (A) joins iteratively the two closest clusters starting from single data points (agglomerative, bottom-up approach, which is fairly more commonly used), or (B) partitions clusters iteratively starting from the complete set (divisive, top-down approach). After each step, a new distance matrix between the newly formed clusters and the other clusters is recalculated. Hierarchical cluster analysis methods include:\nBULLET::::- Single linkage (minimum method, nearest neighbor)\nBULLET::::- Average linkage (UPGMA).\nBULLET::::- Complete linkage (maximum method, furthest neighbor)\nDifferent studies have already shown empirically that the Single linkage clustering algorithm produces poor results when employed to gene expression microarray data and thus should be avoided.\n\nSection::::Techniques.:Clustering.:K-means clustering.\nK-means clustering is an algorithm for grouping genes or samples based on pattern into \"K\" groups. Grouping is done by minimizing the sum of the squares of distances between the data and the corresponding cluster centroid. Thus the purpose of K-means clustering is to classify data based on similar expression.

Initially k documents are chosen as seeds, and each document in the collection is allocated to the cluster for which the seed is the nearest neighbour.

The documents are then allocated again to the cluster with the nearest centroid.

In contrast to K-means clustering, documents are assumed to be comprised of multiple topics. Intuitively, topics are distinguished by the different degrees to which they are associated with words in the vocabulary; a word that is prominent in one topic may be insignificant in another. The approach assumes that a collection covers a known number m of topics and that each document is a blend of a subset of these topics. It also assumes that there is an underlying data generation process in which, first, the topics of a document follows a multinomial distribution, controlled by a common Dirichlet prior for the collection; and second, for each of the topics, the words are generated from another multinomial distribution, controlled by a Dirchlet prior that is shared among topics.

In classification, document categories are specified manually, while in clustering, documents form algorithm-dependent, distinct groups. These two tasks are representative of supervised and unsupervised methods, respectively, yet the goal of both is to produce subsets of documents based on their distinguishing features. Methods for biomedical document clustering have relied upon \"k\"-means clustering."], "wikipedia-22324566": ["Determining the number of clusters in a data set, a quantity often labelled \"k\" as in the \"k\"-means algorithm, is a frequent problem in data clustering, and is a distinct issue from the process of actually solving the clustering problem.\nFor a certain class of clustering algorithms (in particular \"k\"-means, \"k\"-medoids and expectation\u2013maximization algorithm), there is a parameter commonly referred to as \"k\" that specifies the number of clusters to detect. Other algorithms such as DBSCAN and OPTICS algorithm do not require the specification of this parameter; hierarchical clustering avoids the problem altogether.\nThe correct choice of \"k\" is often ambiguous, with interpretations depending on the shape and scale of the distribution of points in a data set and the desired clustering resolution of the user. In addition, increasing \"k\" without penalty will always reduce the amount of error in the resulting clustering, to the extreme case of zero error if each data point is considered its own cluster (i.e., when \"k\" equals the number of data points, \"n\"). Intuitively then, \"the optimal choice of \"k\" will strike a balance between maximum compression of the data using a single cluster, and maximum accuracy by assigning each data point to its own cluster\". If an appropriate value of \"k\" is not apparent from prior knowledge of the properties of the data set, it must be chosen somehow. There are several categories of methods for making this decision.\nSection::::The elbow method.\nThe elbow method looks at the percentage of variance explained as a function of the number of clusters:\nOne should choose a number of clusters so that adding another cluster doesn't give much better modeling of the data.\nMore precisely, if one plots the percentage of variance explained by the clusters against the number of clusters, the first clusters will add much information (explain a lot of variance), but at some point the marginal gain will drop, giving an angle in the graph. The number of clusters is chosen at this point, hence the \"elbow criterion\".\nThis \"elbow\" cannot always be unambiguously identified.\nPercentage of variance explained is the ratio of the between-group variance to the total variance, also known as an F-test. A slight variation of this method plots the curvature of the within group variance.\nThe method can be traced to speculation by Robert L. Thorndike in 1953.\nSection::::X-means clustering.\nIn statistics and data mining, X-means clustering is a variation of k-means clustering that refines cluster assignments by repeatedly attempting subdivision, and keeping the best resulting splits, until a criterion such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is reached.\nSection::::Information criterion approach.\nAnother set of methods for determining the number of clusters are information criteria, such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), or the Deviance information criterion (DIC) \u2014 if it is possible to make a likelihood function for the clustering model. \nFor example: The \"k\"-means model is \"almost\" a Gaussian mixture model and one can construct a likelihood for the Gaussian mixture model and thus also determine information criterion values.\nSection::::An information\u2013theoretic approach.\nRate distortion theory has been applied to choosing \"k\" called the \"jump\" method, which determines the number of clusters that maximizes efficiency while minimizing error by information-theoretic standards. The strategy of the algorithm is to generate a distortion curve for the input data by running a standard clustering algorithm such as k-means for all values of \"k\" between 1 and \"n\", and computing the distortion (described below) of the resulting clustering. The distortion curve is then transformed by a negative power chosen based on the dimensionality of the data. Jumps in the resulting values then signify reasonable choices for \"k\", with the largest jump representing the best choice.\nThe distortion of a clustering of some input data is formally defined as follows: Let the data set be modeled as a \"p\"-dimensional random variable, \"X\", consisting of a mixture distribution of \"G\" components with common covariance, . If we let formula_1 be a set of \"K\" cluster centers, with formula_2 the closest center to a given sample of \"X\", then the minimum average distortion per dimension when fitting the \"K\" centers to the data is:\nThis is also the average Mahalanobis distance per dimension between \"X\" and the set of cluster centers \"C\". Because the minimization over all possible sets of cluster centers is prohibitively complex, the distortion is computed in practice by generating a set of cluster centers using a standard clustering algorithm and computing the distortion using the result. The pseudo-code for the jump method with an input set of \"p\"-dimensional data points \"X\" is:\nThe choice of the transform power formula_4 is motivated by asymptotic reasoning using results from rate distortion theory. Let the data \"X\" have a single, arbitrarily \"p\"-dimensional Gaussian distribution, and let fixed formula_5, for some greater than zero. Then the distortion of a clustering of \"K\" clusters in the limit as \"p\" goes to infinity is formula_6. It can be seen that asymptotically, the distortion of a clustering to the power formula_7 is proportional to formula_8, which by definition is approximately the number of clusters \"K\". In other words, for a single Gaussian distribution, increasing \"K\" beyond the true number of clusters, which should be one, causes a linear growth in distortion. This behavior is important in the general case of a mixture of multiple distribution components.\nLet \"X\" be a mixture of \"G\" \"p\"-dimensional Gaussian distributions with common covariance. Then for any fixed \"K\" less than \"G\", the distortion of a clustering as \"p\" goes to infinity is infinite. Intuitively, this means that a clustering of less than the correct number of clusters is unable to describe asymptotically high-dimensional data, causing the distortion to increase without limit. If, as described above, \"K\" is made an increasing function of \"p\", namely, formula_5, the same result as above is achieved, with the value of the distortion in the limit as \"p\" goes to infinity being equal to formula_10. Correspondingly, there is the same proportional relationship between the transformed distortion and the number of clusters, \"K\".\nPutting the results above together, it can be seen that for sufficiently high values of \"p\", the transformed distortion formula_11 is approximately zero for \"K\"  \"G\", then jumps suddenly and begins increasing linearly for \"K\" \u2265 \"G\". The jump algorithm for choosing \"K\" makes use of these behaviors to identify the most likely value for the true number of clusters.\nAlthough the mathematical support for the method is given in terms of asymptotic results, the algorithm has been empirically verified to work well in a variety of data sets with reasonable dimensionality. In addition to the localized jump method described above, there exists a second algorithm for choosing \"K\" using the same transformed distortion values known as the broken line method. The broken line method identifies the jump point in the graph of the transformed distortion by doing a simple least squares error line fit of two line segments, which in theory will fall along the \"x\"-axis for \"K\" < \"G\", and along the linearly increasing phase of the transformed distortion plot for \"K\" \u2265 \"G\". The broken line method is more robust than the jump method in that its decision is global rather than local, but it also relies on the assumption of Gaussian mixture components, whereas the jump method is fully non-parametric and has been shown to be viable for general mixture distributions.\nSection::::The silhouette method.\nThe average silhouette of the data is another useful criterion for assessing the natural number of clusters. The silhouette of a data instance is a measure of how closely it is matched to data within its cluster and how loosely it is matched to data of the neighbouring cluster, i.e. the cluster whose average distance from the datum is lowest. A silhouette close to 1 implies the datum is in an appropriate cluster, while a silhouette close to \u22121 implies the datum is in the wrong cluster. Optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms are useful in determining the number of clusters that gives rise to the largest silhouette.\nIt is also possible to re-scale the data in such a way that the silhouette is more likely to be maximised at the correct number of clusters.\nSection::::Cross-validation.\nOne can also use the process of cross-validation to analyze the number of clusters. In this process, the data is partitioned into \"v\" parts. Each of the parts is then set aside at turn as a test set, a clustering model computed on the other \"v\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 training sets, and the value of the objective function (for example, the sum of the squared distances to the centroids for \"k\"-means) calculated for the test set. These \"v\" values are calculated and averaged for each alternative number of clusters, and the cluster number selected such that further increase in number of clusters leads to only a small reduction in the objective function. \nSection::::Finding number of clusters in text databases.\nIn text databases, a document collection defined by a document by term D matrix (of size m by n, m: number of documents, n: number of terms) number of clusters can roughly be estimated by the following formula \nformula_12\nwhere t is"], "wikipedia-1539290": ["Group concept mapping involves a structured multi-step process, including brainstorming, sorting and rating, multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis, and the generation and interpretation of multiple maps.

Participants are then asked to individually sort those statements into categories based on their perceived similarity and rate each statement on one or more scales, such as importance or feasibility.\n\nThe data is then analyzed using The Concept System software, which creates a series of interrelated maps using multidimensional scaling (MDS) of the sort data, hierarchical clustering of the MDS coordinates applying Ward's method, and the computation of average ratings for each statement and cluster of statements. The resulting maps display the individual statements in two-dimensional space with more similar statements located closer to each other, and grouped into clusters that partition the space on the map.

Clustering has a long history in IR, and up to the 1980s was regarded as a plausible search mechanism, under which, it was supposed, users would iteratively navigate to ever smaller clusters rather than issue a query [14, 30]. While such approaches did not continue to be explored, as collections grew in size and index-based search technology matured, there has been ongoing interest in clustering in its own right and as a support for a range of search-related tasks [2, 13, 15\u201317]. A range of mechanisms have been proposed for clustering. One approach is bottom-up methods, in particular agglomerative or hierarchical clustering [10, 11, 14, 34]. The other is top-down methods, in particular K-means [4, 8, 23]. In practice, agglomerative methods have not been found to scale to realistic collection sizes, and reported experiments on large collections all seem to use K-means. We therefore use we use K-means for the work in this paper. Although the robustness ofK-means has been questioned, for example with regard to stability and the potential to fall into local minima rather than produce globally optimal outcomes, in a separate project (manuscript in submission) we have observed reasonably stable performance. In brief, inK-means clustering an expected number of clusters, k, is chosen. Initiallyk documents are chosen as seeds, and each document in the collection is allocated to the cluster for which the seed is the nearest neighbour. At each subsequent iteration, the centroid of each cluster is computed; this is the average of the allocated documents. The documents are then allocated again to the cluster with the nearest centroid. This repeats until an iteration limit is reached or the process converges, that is, the clusters are unchanged between iterations. The value of k can be optimised by exploring behaviour as k is varied, for example with the Elbow method [27], but in this work we use fixedk based on results in the separate project mentioned above. The concept of \u2018nearest neighbour\u2019 requires a document representation. In the results reported here, we use a TFIDF calculation of word weights so that documents are represented as a vector whose dimensionality is |V |. A straightforward Cosine formulation is used to determine similarity. To describe clusters we need to label them [24]. Three elementary methods are high-weight terms in the centroids, mutual information (the terms that best discriminate from other clusters), and information drawn from document titles. A wide range of other methods have been described, including use of WordNet [26], choice of terms from concept graphs for clusters [1, 5, 12], and use of neural networks [20]. Here, we only consider simple methods. Topic modelling. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic Bayesian approach to topic modelling proposed by Blei et al. [3]. In contrast to K-means clustering, documents are assumed to be comprised of multiple topics. Intuitively, topics are distinguished by the different degrees to which they are associated with words in the vocabulary; a word that is prominent in one topic may be insignificant in another. The approach assumes that a collection covers a known number m of topics and that each document is a blend of a subset of these topics. It also assumes that there is an underlying data generation process in which, first, the topics of a document follows a multinomial distribution, controlled by a common Dirichlet prior for the collection; and second, for each of the topics, the words are generated from another multinomial distribution, controlled by a Dirchlet prior that is shared among topics. The two distributions are assumed to be independent. LDA learns the distributions governing this generative process for a given corpus as follows. Initially there is a random assignment of topics to each document and of"], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": ["An initial contribution of this paper is comparison of two simple\nmethods for cluster labelling, which we now explain.

It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions.

It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings (including parameters such as the distance function to use, a density threshold or the number of expected clusters) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results.

These are for example the color of a body, its electrical conductivity, its ability to absorb or reflect light, and magnetic phenomena such as ferro-, ferri-, or antiferromagnetism. These are typical collective phenomena which only develop in an aggregate of a large number of atoms.\nIt was found that collective phenomena break down for very small cluster sizes. It turned out, for example, that small clusters of a ferromagnetic material are super-paramagnetic rather than ferromagnetic. Paramagnetism is not a collective phenomenon, which means that the ferromagnetism of the macrostate was not conserved by going into the nanostate. The question then was asked for example, \u201cHow many atoms do we need in order to obtain the collective metallic or magnetic properties of a solid?\u201d Soon after the first cluster sources had been developed in 1980, an ever larger community of cluster scientists was involved in such studies.\nThis development led to the discovery of fullerenes in 1986 and carbon nanotubes a few years later.\nIn science, a lot is known about properties of the gas phase; however, comparatively little is known about the condensed phases (the liquid phase and solid phase.) The study of clusters attempts to bridge this gap of knowledge by clustering atoms together and studying their characteristics. If enough atoms were clustered together, eventually one would obtain a liquid or solid.\nThe study of atomic and molecular clusters also benefits the developing field of nanotechnology.

Clusters exist of diverse stoichiometries and nuclearities. For example, carbon and boron atoms form fullerene and borane clusters, respectively.

In another definition a cluster compound contains \"a group of two or more metal atoms where direct and substantial metal bonding is present\".

For example, polynuclear refers to a cluster with more than one metal atom, regardless of the elemental identities. Heteronuclear refers to a cluster with at least two different metal elements.\nThe main cluster types are \"naked\" clusters (without stabilizing ligands) and those with ligands. For transition metal clusters, typical stabilizing ligands include carbon monoxide, halides, isocyanides, alkenes, and hydrides. For main group elements, typical clusters are stabilized by hydride ligands.\nTransition metal clusters are frequently composed of refractory metal atoms. In general metal centers with extended d-orbitals form stable clusters because of favorable overlap of valence orbitals. Thus, metals with a low oxidation state for the later metals and mid-oxidation states for the early metals tend to form stable clusters. Polynuclear metal carbonyls are generally found in late transition metals with low formal oxidation states.

Surprisingly, what is arguably the simplest cluster labelling method in the literature showed good similarity to topic modelling."], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": ["As the tables show, there are striking similarities between the top words found from the whole cluster and the topic model (the first and second columns), in all three collections. All are highly correlated and many are nearly identical. As discussed above, we had not anticipated this result.\nThe results also include a small number of exceptions, in particular c5\u2013t11 in WSJ-long and c8\u2013t8 and c17\u2013t17 in WSJ-short, where the words are different but there is evident topical similarity. Surprisingly, these matches have the highest match percentages in their respective collection, as shown in the figures above. These are also smaller clusters. Whether these are natural outliers, or indicative of some other underlying behaviour, is difficult to assess on this small volume of data.\nCluster terms sale, unit, amp, inc, share, product, corp, oper, sell, plant\nTopic terms mr, busi, bush, one, time, get, peopl, go, like, work\nCentral terms batteri, daewoo, tariff, ual, dispos, coal, md, mexico, ge, del\nTable 2: A low-match example from the WSJ collection. Here, 42.6% of the documents in cluster c0 belong to topic t3. There is no obvious topical match between the different 10-word representations.\nHowever, it is apparent in these tables that the \u2018central keywords\u2019 method is a complete failure. The parameter choice of 10 documents could be the explanation, but we judge it more likely that the hypothesis that there are documents that are representative of clusters may be misfounded. We discuss this further below.\nSome cluster\u2013topic matches have a low match percentage. For example, Table 2 shows the match between cluster c0 and topic c3 from WSJ, where 42.6% documents in cluster c0 are labelled as topic t3. There isn\u2019t a clear topical relationship amongst these words. Cluster c0 is the largest in WSJ and this result suggests that the mix of topics could be an indicator that, in this case, the clustering has been unsuccessful. That is, a direction to explore is whether the topic model is diagnostic of clustering effectiveness.\nWe have presented results as a listing of words, conveying alignment from a perspective that allow direct human interpretation. A quantitative alternative to would be to compute the vector similarities between the full representations. We have not yet taken that step, but plan to do so in the next stage. In principle it would allow us to systematically explore the extent of the similarities, and, for example, to see the spread of similarities over a sequence of runs (each with different random seeds). Our focus in this stage was on the relative descriptive value of the different approaches, and our results clearly show the strong descriptive similarities."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-41397509": 1, "wikipedia-46399802": 1, "wikipedia-39899468": 1, "wikipedia-46398515": 1, "wikipedia-39778851": 1, "wikipedia-536795": 1, "wikipedia-22292395": 1, "wikipedia-37683658": 1, "wikipedia-54214129": 1, "wikipedia-36281866": 1, "arxiv-2010.14570": 3, "arxiv-2012.10194": 1, "arxiv-2403.15250": 1, "arxiv-1204.4927": 1, "arxiv-1903.07317": 1, "arxiv-hep-ph/9705382": 1, "arxiv-2408.12158": 1, "arxiv-2306.03293": 1, "arxiv-2501.06360": 1, "arxiv-2404.13623": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/1": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-41397509": 1, "wikipedia-46399802": 1, "wikipedia-39899468": 1, "wikipedia-46398515": 1, "wikipedia-39778851": 1, "wikipedia-536795": 1, "wikipedia-22292395": 1, "wikipedia-37683658": 1, "wikipedia-54214129": 1, "wikipedia-36281866": 1, "arxiv-2010.14570": 3, "arxiv-2012.10194": 1, "arxiv-2403.15250": 1, "arxiv-1204.4927": 2, "arxiv-1903.07317": 1, "arxiv-hep-ph/9705382": 1, "arxiv-2408.12158": 1, "arxiv-2306.03293": 1, "arxiv-2501.06360": 1, "arxiv-2404.13623": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/6": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/1": 1}}}

It is a main task of exploratory data mining, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, and computer graphics.\nCluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings (including parameters such as the distance function to use, a density threshold or the number of expected clusters) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results. Cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task, but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi-objective optimization that involves trial and failure. It is often necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties.\nThe notion of a \"cluster\" cannot be precisely defined, which is one of the reasons why there are so many clustering algorithms. There is a common denominator: a group of data objects. However, different researchers employ different cluster models, and for each of these cluster models again different algorithms can be given. The notion of a cluster, as found by different algorithms, varies significantly in its properties. Understanding these \"cluster models\" is key to understanding the differences between the various algorithms. Typical cluster models include:\n- for example, hierarchical clustering builds models based on distance connectivity.\n- for example, the k-means algorithm represents each cluster by a single mean vector.\n- clusters are modeled using statistical distributions, such as multivariate normal distributions used by the expectation-maximization algorithm.\n- for example, DBSCAN and OPTICS defines clusters as connected dense regions in the data space.\n- in biclustering (also known as co-clustering or two-mode-clustering), clusters are modeled with both cluster members and relevant attributes.\n- some algorithms do not provide a refined model for their results and just provide the grouping information.\nA \"clustering\" is essentially a set of such clusters, usually containing all objects in the data set.

A standard visual explanation of clusters is a presentation of them as multiple clouds of dots in a two-dimensional space. The clouds overlap but, appealingly, are sufficiently distinct that they can be perceived as organic units \u2013 an effect that can be enhanced through use of different colours. A feature in some of these visualisations is that the dot-clouds are more crowded at the centre, just as a galaxy is dense in the middle and sparse at the edges. The intuition the dot-cloud metaphor suggests is that there are some archetypal items (documents in this study) at the centre of each cluster that can stand as ideotypes for the whole. In the first of our two approaches to generating representative word lists, we assume that the documents that are closest to the centroid are a good proxy for the whole, so that word lists generated from those documents will be informative about the cluster. In detail, the Cosine distance between each document in the cluster and the centroid is calculated. We select the top 10 documents closest to the centroid and pool them, and select the top (highest-weighted) N words as the representative keywords.

The top (highest-weighted) N words from the centroid are selected as the representative keywords, that is, we use elementary cluster labelling as described above."], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": ["Clustering. Clustering has a long history in IR, and up to the 1980s was regarded as a plausible search mechanism, under which, it was supposed, users would iteratively navigate to ever smaller clusters rather than issue a query [14, 30]. While such approaches did not continue to be explored, as collections grew in size and index-based search technology matured, there has been ongoing interest in clustering in its own right and as a support for a range of search-related tasks [2, 13, 15\u201317].\nA range of mechanisms have been proposed for clustering. One approach is bottom-up methods, in particular agglomerative or hierarchical clustering [10, 11, 14, 34]. The other is top-down methods, in particular K-means [4, 8, 23]. In practice, agglomerative methods have not been found to scale to realistic collection sizes, and reported experiments on large collections all seem to use K-means. We therefore use we use K-means for the work in this paper. Although the robustness ofK-means has been questioned, for example with regard to stability and the potential to fall into local minima rather than produce globally optimal outcomes, in a separate project (manuscript in submission) we have observed reasonably stable performance. In brief, inK-means clustering an expected number of clusters, k, is chosen. Initiallyk documents are chosen as seeds, and each document in the collection is allocated to the cluster for which the seed is the nearest neighbour. At each subsequent iteration, the centroid of each cluster is computed; this is the average of the allocated documents. The documents are then allocated again to the cluster with the nearest centroid. This repeats until an iteration limit is reached or the process converges, that is, the clusters are unchanged between iterations. The value of k can be optimised by exploring behaviour as k is varied, for example with the Elbow method [27], but in this work we use fixedk based on results in the separate project mentioned above.\nThe concept of \u2018nearest neighbour\u2019 requires a document representation. In the results reported here, we use a TFIDF calculation of word weights so that documents are represented as a vector whose dimensionality is |V |. A straightforward Cosine formulation is used to determine similarity.\nTo describe clusters we need to label them [24]. Three elementary methods are high-weight terms in the centroids, mutual information (the terms that best discriminate from other clusters), and information drawn from document titles. A wide range of other methods have been described, including use of WordNet [26], choice of terms from concept graphs for clusters [1, 5, 12], and use of neural networks [20]. Here, we only consider simple methods.\nTopic modelling. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic Bayesian approach to topic modelling proposed by Blei et al. [3]. In contrast to K-means clustering, documents are assumed to be comprised of multiple topics. Intuitively, topics are distinguished by the different degrees to which they are associated with words in the vocabulary; a word that is prominent in one topic may be insignificant in another. The approach assumes that a collection covers a known number m of topics and that each document is a blend of a subset of these topics. It also assumes that there is an underlying data generation process in which, first, the topics of a document follows a multinomial distribution, controlled by a common Dirichlet prior for the collection; and second, for each of the topics, the words are generated from another multinomial distribution, controlled by a Dirchlet prior that is shared among topics. The two distributions are assumed to be independent."], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": ["These results show that independently generated K-means clusters and LDA topics are well aligned. We regard this result as highly surprising.

Correlation clustering provides a method for clustering a set of objects into the optimum number of clusters without specifying that number in advance.\n\nIn machine learning, correlation clustering or cluster editing operates in a scenario where the relationships between the objects are known instead of the actual representations of the objects. For example, given a weighted graph formula_1 where the edge weight indicates whether two nodes are similar (positive edge weight) or different (negative edge weight), the task is to find a clustering that either maximizes agreements (sum of positive edge weights within a cluster plus the absolute value of the sum of negative edge weights between clusters) or minimizes disagreements (absolute value of the sum of negative edge weights within a cluster plus the sum of positive edge weights across clusters). Unlike other clustering algorithms this does not require choosing the number of clusters formula_2 in advance because the objective, to minimize the sum of weights of the cut edges, is independent of the number of clusters.\n\nIt may not be possible to find a perfect clustering, where all similar items are in a cluster while all dissimilar ones are in different clusters. If the graph indeed admits a perfect clustering, then simply deleting all the negative edges and finding the connected components in the remaining graph will return the required clusters.\n\nBut, in general a graph may not have a perfect clustering. For example, given nodes \"a,b,c\" such that \"a,b\" and \"a,c\" are similar while \"b,c\" are dissimilar, a perfect clustering is not possible. In such cases, the task is to find a clustering that maximizes the number of agreements (number of + edges inside clusters plus the number of \u2212 edges between clusters) or minimizes the number of disagreements (the number of \u2212 edges inside clusters plus the number of + edges between clusters). This problem of maximizing the agreements is NP-complete (multiway cut problem reduces to maximizing weighted agreements and the problem of partitioning into triangles can be reduced to the unweighted version)."], "wikipedia-669675": ["Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data mining, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, and computer graphics.\nCluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings (including parameters such as the distance function to use, a density threshold or the number of expected clusters) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results. Cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task, but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi-objective optimization that involves trial and failure. It is often necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties.\n\nThe notion of a \"cluster\" cannot be precisely defined, which is one of the reasons why there are so many clustering algorithms. There is a common denominator: a group of data objects. However, different researchers employ different cluster models, and for each of these cluster models again different algorithms can be given. The notion of a cluster, as found by different algorithms, varies significantly in its properties. Understanding these \"cluster models\" is key to understanding the differences between the various algorithms. Typical cluster models include:\nBULLET::::- \"s\": for example, hierarchical clustering builds models based on distance connectivity.\nBULLET::::- \"s\": for example, the k-means algorithm represents each cluster by a single mean vector.\nBULLET::::- \"s\": clusters are modeled using statistical distributions, such as multivariate normal distributions used by the expectation-maximization algorithm.\nBULLET::::- \"s\": for example, DBSCAN and OPTICS defines clusters as connected dense regions in the data space.\nBULLET::::- \"s\": in biclustering (also known as co-clustering or two-mode-clustering), clusters are modeled with both cluster members and relevant attributes.\nBULLET::::- \"s\": some algorithms do not provide a refined model for their results and just provide the grouping information.\nBULLET::::- \"s\": a clique, that is, a subset of nodes in a graph such that every two nodes in the subset are connected by an edge can be considered as a prototypical form of cluster. Relaxations of the complete connectivity requirement (a fraction of the edges can be missing) are known as quasi-cliques, as in the HCS clustering algorithm.\nBULLET::::- \"Signed graph models\": Every path in a signed graph has a sign from the product of the signs on the edges. Under the assumptions of balance theory, edges may change sign and result in a bifurcated graph. The weaker \"clusterability axiom\" (no cycle has exactly one negative edge) yields results with more than two clusters, or subgraphs with only positive edges.\nBULLET::::- \"s\": the most well known unsupervised neural network is the self-organizing map and these models can usually be characterized as similar to one or more of the above models, and including subspace models when neural networks implement a form of Principal Component Analysis or Independent Component Analysis.\nA \"clustering\" is essentially a set of such clusters, usually containing all objects in the data set. Additionally, it may specify the relationship of the clusters to each other, for example, a hierarchy of clusters embedded in each other. Clusterings can be roughly distinguished as:\nBULLET::::- \": each object belongs to a cluster or not\nBULLET::::- ' (also: '): each object belongs to each cluster to a certain degree (for example, a likelihood of belonging to the cluster)\nThere are also finer distinctions possible, for example:\nBULLET::::- \": each object belongs to exactly one cluster\nBULLET::::- \": objects can also belong to no cluster, and are considered outliers\nBULLET::::- \" (also: \"alternative clustering\", \"multi-view clustering\"): objects may belong to more than one cluster; usually involving hard clusters\nBULLET::::- \": objects that belong to a child cluster also belong to the parent cluster\nBULLET::::- \": while an overlapping clustering, within a uniquely defined subspace, clusters are not expected to overlap"]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Clustering has a long history in IR, and up to the 1980s was regarded as a plausible search mechanism, under which, it was supposed, users would iteratively navigate to ever smaller clusters rather than issue a query [14, 30]. While such approaches did not continue to be explored, as collections grew in size and index-based search technology matured, there has been ongoing interest in clustering in its own right and as a support for a range of search-related tasks [2, 13, 15\u201317].\nA range of mechanisms have been proposed for clustering. One approach is bottom-up methods, in particular agglomerative or hierarchical clustering [10, 11, 14, 34]. The other is top-down methods, in particular K-means [4, 8, 23]. In practice, agglomerative methods have not been found to scale to realistic collection sizes, and reported experiments on large collections all seem to use K-means. We therefore use we use K-means for the work in this paper. Although the robustness ofK-means has been questioned, for example with regard to stability and the potential to fall into local minima rather than produce globally optimal outcomes, in a separate project (manuscript in submission) we have observed reasonably stable performance. In brief, inK-means clustering an expected number of clusters, k, is chosen. Initiallyk documents are chosen as seeds, and each document in the collection is allocated to the cluster for which the seed is the nearest neighbour. At each subsequent iteration, the centroid of each cluster is computed; this is the average of the allocated documents. The documents are then allocated again to the cluster with the nearest centroid. This repeats until an iteration limit is reached or the process converges, that is, the clusters are unchanged between iterations. The value of k can be optimised by exploring behaviour as k is varied, for example with the Elbow method [27], but in this work we use fixedk based on results in the separate project mentioned above.\nThe concept of \u2018nearest neighbour\u2019 requires a document representation. In the results reported here, we use a TFIDF calculation of word weights so that documents are represented as a vector whose dimensionality is |V |. A straightforward Cosine formulation is used to determine similarity.\nTo describe clusters we need to label them [24]. Three elementary methods are high-weight terms in the centroids, mutual information (the terms that best discriminate from other clusters), and information drawn from document titles. A wide range of other methods have been described, including use of WordNet [26], choice of terms from concept graphs for clusters [1, 5, 12], and use of neural networks [20]. Here, we only consider simple methods.\nTopic modelling. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic Bayesian approach to topic modelling proposed by Blei et al. [3]. In contrast to K-means clustering, documents are assumed to be comprised of multiple topics. Intuitively, topics are distinguished by the different degrees to which they are associated with words in the vocabulary; a word that is prominent in one topic may be insignificant in another. The approach assumes that a collection covers a known number m of topics and that each document is a blend of a subset of these topics. It also assumes that there is an underlying data generation process in which, first, the topics of a document follows a multinomial distribution, controlled by a common Dirichlet prior for the collection; and second, for each of the topics, the words are generated from another multinomial distribution, controlled by a Dirchlet prior that is shared among topics. The two distributions are assumed to be independent.\nLDA learns the distributions governing this generative process for a given corpus as follows. Initially there is a random assignment of topics to each document and of"], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": ["One of these is clustering, in which the collection is partitioned into subcollections with the goal of the subcollections being distinct from each other and more narrowly themed than is the collection as a whole. The other is topic modelling, in which each topic is a mapping from the set of terms (words) in the collections to a set of weights; the highly weighted words for a topic are anticipated to represent a semantic theme. As we show, the alignment can be observed in two different ways: through the dominance of specific topics within individual clusters, and through inspection of the significant words in clusters and topics. That is, in a complementary way we have compared clustering to topic modelling by mapping them in both directions."], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": ["A perfect alignment would be that each cluster only contains one topic label and that each topic only appears in one cluster. Visually, most horizontal bars are predominately filled by one or a small number of segments. For WSJ, for example, in 17 of the 20 clusters more than half the documents are from a single topic; forWSJ-long the result is 16 of 20 and for WSJ-short it is 14 of 20. That is, for most clusters, the topic distribution is very skewed and gravitates towards one or few topics.\nThese results show that independently generated K-means clusters and LDA topics are well aligned. We regard this result as highly surprising. The mechanisms by which the topics and clusters are arrived at is very different, and one is not a simple transform of the other: clustering involves the non-linear Cosine measure, while LDA allocates mixes of topics to documents and does not involve document comparisons."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-21417820": 1, "wikipedia-24693249": 1, "wikipedia-669675": 2, "wikipedia-21784578": 1, "wikipedia-1809740": 1, "wikipedia-1506351": 1, "wikipedia-733929": 1, "wikipedia-49168255": 1, "wikipedia-1525765": 1, "wikipedia-47902284": 1, "arxiv-2207.04141": 1, "arxiv-1504.04208": 1, "arxiv-2402.18711": 1, "arxiv-1909.07757": 1, "arxiv-1702.08210": 1, "arxiv-astro-ph/0105522": 1, "arxiv-1611.04822": 1, "arxiv-2104.07840": 1, "arxiv-2502.19897": 1, "arxiv-1911.08370": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/7": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-21417820": 2, "wikipedia-24693249": 1, "wikipedia-669675": 3, "wikipedia-21784578": 1, "wikipedia-1809740": 1, "wikipedia-1506351": 1, "wikipedia-733929": 1, "wikipedia-49168255": 1, "wikipedia-1525765": 1, "wikipedia-47902284": 1, "arxiv-2207.04141": 1, "arxiv-1504.04208": 1, "arxiv-2402.18711": 1, "arxiv-1909.07757": 1, "arxiv-1702.08210": 1, "arxiv-astro-ph/0105522": 1, "arxiv-1611.04822": 1, "arxiv-2104.07840": 1, "arxiv-2502.19897": 1, "arxiv-1911.08370": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/7": 1}}}

We have observed that the majority of clusters are\ndominated by a single topic and that cluster-based word lists often\nalign closely with topic-based word lists. Our interpretation is that\nboth are somewhat effective in gathering information by theme,\nand, moreover, it does appear that there are true underlying themes\nthat can be meaningfully gathered.\nHowever, clustering and topic modelling are not equivalent.\nTopic modelling is arguably richer, in that it provides a multifaceted\ndescription of each document; here we have focused on the dom-\ninant topic in each document, but other topics can be significant.\nThe obverse of this observation is that some topics can assist in\ndescription of many documents but never be dominant, which is a\ncommon feature of topic models. As a consequence \u2013 for the pur-\nposes of comparing clustering and topic modelling, at least \u2013 the\neffective number of topics is reduced. Another perspective on this\nobservation is that clustering can create subcategories of documents\nthat share a dominant topic, while topic modelling supplements\nclustering by identifying subtopics.\nSome clusters are a mix of topics, with no one topic well repre-\nsented, and large clusters are less likely to have a strongly dominant\ntopic than are small clusters. As noted above, this suggests that\ntopic modelling can be used to test the cohesion of a cluster.\nThe \u2018central keywords\u2019 method for generating textual descrip-\ntions was not successful. In our view the likely explanation is that\nit is based on a false assumption, namely that clusters resemble a\ndot-cloud.

Clustering has a long history in IR, and up to the 1980s was regarded as a plausible search mechanism, under which, it was supposed, users would iteratively navigate to ever smaller clusters rather than issue a query [14, 30]. While such approaches did not continue to be explored, as collections grew in size and index-based search technology matured, there has been ongoing interest in clustering in its own right and as a support for a range of search-related tasks [2, 13, 15\u201317]. A range of mechanisms have been proposed for clustering. One approach is bottom-up methods, in particular agglomerative or hierarchical clustering [10, 11, 14, 34]. The other is top-down methods, in particular K-means [4, 8, 23]. In practice, agglomerative methods have not been found to scale to realistic collection sizes, and reported experiments on large collections all seem to use K-means. We therefore use we use K-means for the work in this paper. Although the robustness ofK-means has been questioned, for example with regard to stability and the potential to fall into local minima rather than produce globally optimal outcomes, in a separate project (manuscript in submission) we have observed reasonably stable performance. In brief, inK-means clustering an expected number of clusters, k, is chosen. Initiallyk documents are chosen as seeds, and each document in the collection is allocated to the cluster for which the seed is the nearest neighbour. At each subsequent iteration, the centroid of each cluster is computed; this is the average of the allocated documents. The documents are then allocated again to the cluster with the nearest centroid. This repeats until an iteration limit is reached or the process converges, that is, the clusters are unchanged between iterations. The value of k can be optimised by exploring behaviour as k is varied, for example with the Elbow method [27], but in this work we use fixedk based on results in the separate project mentioned above. The concept of \u2018nearest neighbour\u2019 requires a document representation. In the results reported here, we use a TFIDF calculation of word weights so that documents are represented as a vector whose dimensionality is |V |. A straightforward Cosine formulation is used to determine similarity. To describe clusters we need to label them [24]. Three elementary methods are high-weight terms in the centroids, mutual information (the terms that best discriminate from other clusters), and information drawn from document titles. A wide range of other methods have been described, including use of WordNet [26], choice of terms from concept graphs for clusters [1, 5, 12], and use of neural networks [20]. Here, we only consider simple methods. Topic modelling. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic Bayesian approach to topic modelling proposed by Blei et al. [3]. In contrast to K-means clustering, documents are assumed to be comprised of multiple topics.

These are intended to give a human-interpretable description of the semantics of the topic. In contrast to some of the work discussed above, in our research clusters are represented with keywords and are determined independently of consideration of topic models.\nKeywords from central documents (central keywords). A standard visual explanation of clusters is a presentation of them as multiple clouds of dots in a two-dimensional space. The clouds overlap but, appealingly, are sufficiently distinct that they can be perceived as organic units \u2013 an effect that can be enhanced through use of different colours. A feature in some of these visualisations is that the dot-clouds are more crowded at the centre, just as a galaxy is dense in the middle and sparse at the edges.\nThe intuition the dot-cloud metaphor suggests is that there are some archetypal items (documents in this study) at the centre of each cluster that can stand as ideotypes for the whole. In the first of our two approaches to generating representative word lists, we assume that the documents that are closest to the centroid are a good proxy for the whole, so that word lists generated from those documents will be informative about the cluster.\nIn detail, the Cosine distance between each document in the cluster and the centroid is calculated. We select the top 10 documents closest to the centroid and pool them, and select the top (highest-weighted) N words as the representative keywords.\nKeywords by all documents of a cluster (cluster keywords). An alternative to using the documents that are close to the centre is to use them all.

That is, they may dilute the topical integrity that might be observed closer to the cluster\u2019s centre.

This proportion is, according to Magnus, above the average for other letters.\nAnother hypothesis states that if a word begins with a particular phoneme, then there is likely to be a number of other words starting with that phoneme that refer to the same thing. An example given by Magnus is if the basic word for 'house' in a given language starts with a /h/, then by clustering, disproportionately many words containing /h/ can be expected to concern housing: hut, home, hovel, habitat...\nSound symbolic words cannot be broken down into smaller units of meaning.

Although no single definition of a similarity measure exists, usually such measures are in some sense the inverse of distance metrics: they take on large values for similar objects and either zero or a negative value for very dissimilar objects.\nCosine similarity is a commonly used similarity measure for real-valued vectors, used in (among other fields) information retrieval to score the similarity of documents in the vector space model. In machine learning, common kernel functions such as the RBF kernel can be viewed as similarity functions.\nSection::::Use in clustering.\nIn spectral clustering, a similarity, or affinity, measure is used to transform data to overcome difficulties related to lack of convexity in the shape of the data distribution. The measure gives rise to an formula_1-sized \"similarity matrix\" for a set of points, where the entry formula_2 in the matrix can be simply the (negative of the) Euclidean distance between formula_3 and formula_4, or it can be a more complex measure of distance such as the Gaussian formula_5. Further modifying this result with network analysis techniques is also common.\nSection::::Use in sequence alignment.\nSimilarity matrices are used in sequence alignment. Higher scores are given to more-similar characters, and lower or negative scores for dissimilar characters.\nNucleotide similarity matrices are used to align nucleic acid sequences. Because there are only four nucleotides commonly found in DNA (Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Thymine (T)), nucleotide similarity matrices are much simpler than protein similarity matrices. For example, a simple matrix will assign identical bases a score of +1 and non-identical bases a score of \u22121. A more complicated matrix would give a higher score to transitions (changes from a pyrimidine such as C or T to another pyrimidine, or from a purine such as A or G to another purine) than to transversions (from a pyrimidine to a purine or vice versa).\nThe match/mismatch ratio of the matrix sets the target evolutionary distance. The +1/\u22123 DNA matrix used by BLASTN is best suited for finding matches between sequences that are 99% identical; a +1/\u22121 (or +4/\u22124) matrix is much more suited to sequences with about 70% similarity. Matrices for lower similarity sequences require longer sequence alignments.\nAmino acid similarity matrices are more complicated, because there are 20 amino acids coded for by the genetic code, and so a larger number of possible substitutions. Therefore, the similarity matrix for amino acids contains 400 entries (although it is usually symmetric). The first approach scored all amino acid changes equally. A later refinement was to determine amino acid similarities based on how many base changes were required to change a codon to code for that amino acid. This model is better, but it doesn't take into account the selective pressure of amino acid changes. Better models took into account the chemical properties of amino acids.\nOne approach has been to empirically generate the similarity matrices. The Dayhoff method used phylogenetic trees and sequences taken from species on the tree. This approach has given rise to the PAM series of matrices. PAM matrices are labelled based on how many nucleotide changes have occurred, per 100 amino acids. \nWhile the PAM matrices benefit from having a well understood evolutionary model, they are most useful at short evolutionary distances (PAM10\u2013PAM120). At long evolutionary distances, for example PAM250 or 20% identity, it has been shown that the BLOSUM matrices are much more effective.\nThe BLOSUM series were generated by comparing a number of divergent sequences.

Not all regular equivalences are necessarily automorphic or structural; and not all automorphic equivalences are necessarily structural.\n\nSection::::Structural equivalence.\nTwo vertices of a network are structurally equivalent if they share many of the same neighbors. \nThere is no actor who has exactly the same set of ties as actor A, so actor A is in a class by itself. The same is true for actors B, C, D and G. Each of these nodes has a unique set of edges to other nodes. E and F, however, fall in the same structural equivalence class. Each has only one edge; and that tie is to B. Since E and F have exactly the same pattern of edges with all the vertices, they are structurally equivalent. The same is true in the case of H and I.\nStructural equivalence is the strongest form of similarity. In many real networks exact equivalence may be rare, and it could be useful to ease the criteria and measure approximate equivalence. \nA closely related concept is \"institutional equivalence\": two actors (e.g., firms) are institutionally equivalent if they operate in the same set of institutional fields. While structurally equivalent actors have identical relational patterns or network positions, institutional equivalence captures the similarity of institutional influences that actors experience from being in the same fields, regardless of how similar their network positions are. For example, two banks in Chicago might have very different patterns of ties (e.g., one may be a central node, and the other may be in a peripheral position) such that they are not structural equivalents, but because they both operate in the field of finance and banking and in the same geographically defined field (Chicago), they will be subject to some of the same institutional influences.\nSection::::Structural equivalence.:Measures for structural equivalence.\nSection::::Structural equivalence.:Measures for structural equivalence.:Cosine similarity.\nA simple count of common neighbors for two vertices is not on its own a very good measure. One should know the degree of the vertices or how many common neighbors other pairs of vertices has. Cosine similarity takes into account these regards and also allow for the varying degrees of vertices. Salton proposed that we regard the i-th and j-th rows/columns of the adjacency matrix as two vectors and use the cosine of the angle between them as a similarity measure. The cosine similarity of i and j is the number of common neighbors divided by the geometric mean of their degrees. \nIts value lies in the range from 0 to 1. The value of 1 indicates that the two vertices have exactly the same neighbors while the value of zero means that they do not have any common neighbors. Cosine similarity is technically undefined if one or both of the nodes has zero degree, but according to the convention we say that cosine similarity is 0 in these cases.\nSection::::Structural equivalence.:Measures for structural equivalence.:Pearson coefficient.\nPearson product-moment correlation coefficient is an alternative method to normalize the count of common neighbors. This method compares the number of common neighbors with the expected value that count would take in a network where vertices are connected randomly. This quantity lies strictly in the range from -1 to 1.\nSection::::Structural equivalence.:Measures for structural equivalence.:Euclidean distance.\nEuclidean distance is equal to the number of neighbors that differ between two vertices. It is rather a dissimilarity measure, since it is larger for vertices which differ more. It could be normalized by dividing by its maximum value. The maximum means that there are no common neighbors, in which case the distance is equal to the sum of the degrees of the vertices.\nSection::::Automorphic equivalence.\nFormally \"Two vertices are automorphically equivalent if all the vertices can be re-labeled to form an isomorphic graph with the labels of u and v interchanged. Two automorphically equivalent vertices share exactly the same label-independent properties.\"\nMore intuitively, actors are automorphically equivalent if we can permute the graph in such a way that exchanging the two actors has no effect on the distances among all actors in the graph.\nSuppose the graph describes the organizational structure of a company. Actor A is the central headquarter, actors B, C, and D are managers. Actors E, F and H, I are workers at smaller stores; G is the lone worker at another store.\nEven though actor B and actor D are not structurally equivalent (they do have the same boss, but not the same workers), they do seem to be \"equivalent\" in a different sense. Both manager B and D has a boss (in this case, the same boss), and each has two workers. If we swapped them, and also swapped the four workers, all of the distances among all the actors in the network would be exactly identical. \nThere are actually five automorphic equivalence classes: {A}, {B, D}, {C}, {E, F, H, I}, and {G}. Note that the less strict definition of \"equivalence\" has reduced the number of classes.\nSection::::Regular equivalence.\nFormally, \"Two actors are regularly equivalent if they are equally related to equivalent others.\" In other words, regularly equivalent vertices are vertices that, while they do not necessarily share neighbors, have neighbors who are themselves similar.\nTwo mothers, for example, are equivalent, because each has a similar pattern of connections with a husband, children, etc. The two mothers do not have ties to the same husband or the same children, so they are not structurally equivalent. Because different mothers may have different numbers of husbands and children, they will not be automorphically equivalent. But they are similar because they have the same relationships with some member or members of another set of actors (who are themselves regarded as equivalent because of the similarity of their ties to a member of the set \"mother\").\nIn the graph there are three regular equivalence classes. The first is actor A; the second is composed of the three actors B, C, and D; the third consists of the remaining five actors E, F, G, H, and I.\nThe easiest class to see is the five actors across the bottom of the diagram (E, F, G, H, and I). These actors are regularly equivalent to one another because:\nBULLET::::1. they have no tie with any actor in the first class (that is, with actor A) and\nBULLET::::2. each has a tie with an actor in the second class (either B or C or D).\nEach of the five actors, then, has an identical pattern of ties with actors in the other classes.\nActors B, C, and D form a class similarly. B and D actually have ties with two members of the third class, whereas actor C has a tie to only one member of the third class, but this doesn't matter, as there is a tie to some member of the third class.\nActor A is in a class by itself, defined by:\nBULLET::::1. a tie to at least one member of class two and\nBULLET::::2. no tie to any member of class three."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. **Yes**  \n2.

Structural equivalence is the strongest form of similarity. In many real networks exact equivalence may be rare, and it could be useful to ease the criteria and measure approximate equivalence. Measures for structural equivalence include:\n\nCosine similarity: A simple count of common neighbors for two vertices is not on its own a very good measure. One should know the degree of the vertices or how many common neighbors other pairs of vertices has. Cosine similarity takes into account these regards and also allow for the varying degrees of vertices. Salton proposed that we regard the i-th and j-th rows/columns of the adjacency matrix as two vectors and use the cosine of the angle between them as a similarity measure. The cosine similarity of i and j is the number of common neighbors divided by the geometric mean of their degrees. Its value lies in the range from 0 to 1. The value of 1 indicates that the two vertices have exactly the same neighbors while the value of zero means that they do not have any common neighbors. Cosine similarity is technically undefined if one or both of the nodes has zero degree, but according to the convention we say that cosine similarity is 0 in these cases.\n\nPearson coefficient: Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is an alternative method to normalize the count of common neighbors. This method compares the number of common neighbors with the expected value that count would take in a network where vertices are connected randomly. This quantity lies strictly in the range from -1 to 1.\n\nEuclidean distance: Euclidean distance is equal to the number of neighbors that differ between two vertices. It is rather a dissimilarity measure, since it is larger for vertices which differ more. It could be normalized by dividing by its maximum value. The maximum means that there are no common neighbors, in which case the distance is equal to the sum of the degrees of the vertices.\n\nAutomorphic equivalence: Formally \"Two vertices are automorphically equivalent if all the vertices can be re-labeled to form an isomorphic graph with the labels of u and v interchanged. Two automorphically equivalent vertices share exactly the same label-independent properties.\" More intuitively, actors are automorphically equivalent if we can permute the graph in such a way that exchanging the two actors has no effect on the distances among all actors in the graph.\n\nRegular equivalence: Formally, \"Two actors are regularly equivalent if they are equally related to equivalent others.\" In other words, regularly equivalent vertices are vertices that, while they do not necessarily share neighbors, have neighbors who are themselves similar."], "wikipedia-19518308": ["SimRank is applicable in any domain with object-to-object relationships, that measures similarity of the structural context in which objects occur, based on their relationships with other objects.

Unlike other techniques that require complicated label extraction and manual pre-processing of web forms, CAFC clustering is done automatically and uses meta-data to handle web forms that are content rich and contain multiple attributes.\n\nDeepPeep further extracts information called Meta-Data from these pages which allows for better ranking of links and databases with the use of LabelEx, an approach for automatic decomposition and extraction of meta-data. Meta-data is data from web links that give information about other domains. LabelEx identifies the element-label mapping and uses the mapping to extract meta-data with accuracy unlike conventional approaches that used manually specific extraction rules.\n\nWhen the search results pop up after the user has input their keyword, DeepPeep ranks the links based on 3 features: term content, number of backlinks. and pagerank. Firstly, the term content is simply determined by the content of the web link and its relevance. Backlinks are hyperlinks or links that direct the user to a different website. Pageranks is the ranking of websites in search engine results and works by counting the amount and quality of links to website to determine its importance. Pagerank and back link information are obtained from outside sources such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Once relevance levels have been assigned to the retrieved results, information retrieval performance measures can be used to assess the quality of a retrieval system's output."], "wikipedia-17785794": ["A concept search can overcome these challenges by employing word sense disambiguation (WSD), and other techniques, to help it derive the actual meanings of the words, and their underlying concepts, rather than by simply matching character strings like keyword search technologies.\n\nIn general, information retrieval research and technology can be divided into two broad categories: semantic and statistical. Information retrieval systems that fall into the semantic category will attempt to implement some degree of syntactic and semantic analysis of the natural language text that a human user would provide (also see computational linguistics). Systems that fall into the statistical category will find results based on statistical measures of how closely they match the query. However, systems in the semantic category also often rely on statistical methods to help them find and retrieve information.\n\nEfforts to provide information retrieval systems with semantic processing capabilities have basically used three different approaches:\nBULLET::::- Auxiliary structures\nBULLET::::- Local co-occurrence statistics\nBULLET::::- Transform techniques (particularly matrix decompositions)\n\nSection::::Approaches.:Auxiliary structures.\nA variety of techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have been applied to semantic processing, and most of them have relied on the use of auxiliary structures such as controlled vocabularies and ontologies. Controlled vocabularies (dictionaries and thesauri), and ontologies allow broader terms, narrower terms, and related terms to be incorporated into queries. Controlled vocabularies are one way to overcome some of the most severe constraints of Boolean keyword queries. Over the years, additional auxiliary structures of general interest, such as the large synonym sets of WordNet, have been constructed. It was shown that concept search that is based on auxiliary structures, such as WordNet, can be efficiently implemented by reusing retrieval models and data structures of classical information retrieval. Later approaches have implemented grammars to expand the range of semantic constructs. The creation of data models that represent sets of concepts within a specific domain (\"domain ontologies\"), and which can incorporate the relationships among terms, has also been implemented in recent years.\n\nSection::::Approaches.:Local co-occurrence statistics.\nInformation retrieval systems incorporating this approach count the number of times that groups of terms appear together (co-occur) within a sliding window of terms or sentences (for example, \u00b1 5 sentences or \u00b1 50 words) within a document. It is based on the idea that words that occur together in similar contexts have similar meanings. It is local in the sense that the sliding window of terms and sentences used to determine the co-occurrence of terms is relatively small.\n\nSection::::Approaches.:Transform techniques.\nSome of the most powerful approaches to semantic processing are based on the use of mathematical transform techniques. Matrix decomposition techniques have been the most successful. Some widely used matrix decomposition techniques include the following:\nBULLET::::- Independent component analysis\nBULLET::::- Semi-discrete decomposition\nBULLET::::- Non-negative matrix factorization\nBULLET::::- Singular value decomposition\nMatrix decomposition techniques are data-driven, which avoids many of the drawbacks associated with auxiliary structures. They are also global in nature, which means they are capable of much more robust information extraction and representation of semantic information than techniques based on local co-occurrence statistics.\n\nSingular value decomposition (SVD) was first applied to text at Bell Labs in the late 1980s. It was used as the foundation for a technique called latent semantic indexing (LSI) because of its ability to find the semantic meaning that is latent in a collection of text. At first, the SVD was slow to be adopted because of the resource requirements needed to work with large datasets. However, the use of LSI has significantly expanded in recent years as earlier challenges in scalability and performance have been overcome and even open sourced. LSI is being used in a variety of information retrieval and text processing applications, although its primary application has been for concept searching and automated document categorization."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Although no single definition of a similarity measure exists, usually such measures are in some sense the inverse of distance metrics: they take on large values for similar objects and either zero or a negative value for very dissimilar objects. Cosine similarity is a commonly used similarity measure for real-valued vectors, used in (among other fields) information retrieval to score the similarity of documents in the vector space model. In machine learning, common kernel functions such as the RBF kernel can be viewed as similarity functions. \nSimilarity matrices are used in sequence alignment. Higher scores are given to more-similar characters, and lower or negative scores for dissimilar characters. \nNucleotide similarity matrices are used to align nucleic acid sequences. Because there are only four nucleotides commonly found in DNA (Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Thymine (T)), nucleotide similarity matrices are much simpler than protein similarity matrices. For example, a simple matrix will assign identical bases a score of +1 and non-identical bases a score of \u22121. A more complicated matrix would give a higher score to transitions (changes from a pyrimidine such as C or T to another pyrimidine, or from a purine such as A or G to another purine) than to transversions (from a pyrimidine to a purine or vice versa). \nThe match/mismatch ratio of the matrix sets the target evolutionary distance. The +1/\u22123 DNA matrix used by BLASTN is best suited for finding matches between sequences that are 99% identical; a +1/\u22121 (or +4/\u22124) matrix is much more suited to sequences with about 70% similarity. Matrices for lower similarity sequences require longer sequence alignments. \nAmino acid similarity matrices are more complicated, because there are 20 amino acids coded for by the genetic code, and so a larger number of possible substitutions. Therefore, the similarity matrix for amino acids contains 400 entries (although it is usually symmetric). The first approach scored all amino acid changes equally. A later refinement was to determine amino acid similarities based on how many base changes were required to change a codon to code for that amino acid. This model is better, but it doesn't take into account the selective pressure of amino acid changes. Better models took into account the chemical properties of amino acids. \nOne approach has been to empirically generate the similarity matrices. The Dayhoff method used phylogenetic trees and sequences taken from species on the tree. This approach has given rise to the PAM series of matrices. PAM matrices are labelled based on how many nucleotide changes have occurred, per 100 amino acids. While the PAM matrices benefit from having a well understood evolutionary model, they are most useful at short evolutionary distances (PAM10\u2013PAM120). At long evolutionary distances, for example PAM250 or 20% identity, it has been shown that the BLOSUM matrices are much more effective. \nThe BLOSUM series were generated by comparing a number of divergent sequences. The BLOSUM series are labeled based on how much entropy remains unmutated between all sequences, so a lower BLOSUM number corresponds to a higher PAM number."], "wikipedia-60469653": ["Sufficient similarity is a 20th-century para-legal concept used in the chemical industry for toxicological studies. The term was first employed in a restricted sense to assess surrogacy of chemical mixtures by the EPA, and has descended from there into the scientific argot. The concept is somewhat nebulous, and statistics are involved. A group of America researchers in 2018 posed themselves the question \"how similar must a product be in order to be well-represented by the tested reference sample?\" Because the concept was derived from the EPA, chemical similarity and biological similarity are equally important. The concept is employed \"so that safety data from the tested reference can be applied to untested materials,\" because \"when toxicity data are not available for a chemical mixture of concern, US EPA guidelines allow risk assessment to be based on data for a surrogate mixture considered \u201csufficiently similar\u201d in terms of chemical composition and component proportions.\""]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Hobbes, on the other hand, conceived of the mind and the will as purely mechanistic, completely explicable in terms of the effects of perception and the pursuit of desire, which in turn he held to be completely explicable in terms of the materialistic operations of the nervous system.

One approach is bottom-up methods, in particular agglomerative or hierarchical clustering [10, 11, 14, 34]. The other is top-down methods, in particular K-means [4, 8, 23]. In practice, agglomerative methods have not been found to scale to realistic collection sizes, and reported experiments on large collections all seem to use K-means. We therefore use we use K-means for the work in this paper. Although the robustness of K-means has been questioned, for example with regard to stability and the potential to fall into local minima rather than produce globally optimal outcomes, in a separate project (manuscript in submission) we have observed reasonably stable performance. In brief, in K-means clustering an expected number of clusters, k, is chosen. Initially k documents are chosen as seeds, and each document in the collection is allocated to the cluster for which the seed is the nearest neighbour. At each subsequent iteration, the centroid of each cluster is computed; this is the average of the allocated documents. The documents are then allocated again to the cluster with the nearest centroid. This repeats until an iteration limit is reached or the process converges, that is, the clusters are unchanged between iterations. The value of k can be optimised by exploring behaviour as k is varied, for example with the Elbow method [27], but in this work we use fixed k based on results in the separate project mentioned above.\n\nTopic modelling. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic Bayesian approach to topic modelling proposed by Blei et al. [3]. In contrast to K-means clustering, documents are assumed to be comprised of multiple topics. Intuitively, topics are distinguished by the different degrees to which they are associated with words in the vocabulary; a word that is prominent in one topic may be insignificant in another. The approach assumes that a collection covers a known number m of topics and that each document is a blend of a subset of these topics. It also assumes that there is an underlying data generation process in which, first, the topics of a document follows a multinomial distribution, controlled by a common Dirichlet prior for the collection; and second, for each of the topics, the words are generated from another multinomial distribution, controlled by a Dirichlet prior that is shared among topics.

(One of the philosophical implications of modern quantum mechanics is that this view of determinism is not defensible.)\n\nSection::::Anthropic mechanism.\nThe thesis in anthropic mechanism is not that everything can be completely explained in mechanical terms (although some anthropic mechanists may \"also\" believe that), but rather that everything \"about human beings\" can be completely explained in mechanical terms, as surely as can everything about clocks or the internal combustion engine.\n\nOne of the chief obstacles that all mechanistic theories have faced is providing a mechanistic explanation of the human mind; Descartes, for one, endorsed dualism in spite of endorsing a completely mechanistic conception of the material world because he argued that mechanism and the notion of a mind were logically incompatible. Hobbes, on the other hand, conceived of the mind and the will as purely mechanistic, completely explicable in terms of the effects of perception and the pursuit of desire, which in turn he held to be completely explicable in terms of the materialistic operations of the nervous system."], "wikipedia-3439285": ["Forbidden mechanism\nIn spectroscopy, a forbidden mechanism (forbidden transition or forbidden line) is a spectral line associated with absorption or emission of light by atomic nuclei, atoms, or molecules which undergo a transition that is not allowed by a particular selection rule but is allowed if the approximation associated with that rule is not made. For example, in a situation where, according to usual approximations (such as the electric-dipole approximation for the interaction with light), the process cannot happen, but at a higher level of approximation (e.g. magnetic dipole, or electric quadrupole) the process is allowed but at a much lower rate.\nAn example is phosphorescent glow in the dark materials, which absorb light and form an excited state whose decay involves a spin flip, and is therefore forbidden by electric dipole transitions. The result is emission of light slowly over minutes or hours.\nAlthough the transitions are nominally forbidden, there is a small probability of their spontaneous occurrence, should an atomic nucleus, atom or molecule be raised to an excited state. More precisely, there is a certain probability that such an excited entity will make a forbidden transition to a lower energy state per unit time; by definition, this probability is much lower than that for any transition permitted or allowed by the selection rules. Therefore, if a state can de-excite via a permitted transition (or otherwise, e.g. via collisions) it will almost certainly do so before any transition occurs via a forbidden route. Nevertheless, most forbidden transitions are only relatively unlikely: states that can only decay in this way (so-called meta-stable states) usually have lifetimes on the order milliseconds to seconds, compared to less than a microsecond for decay via permitted transitions. In some radioactive decay systems, multiple levels of forbiddenness can stretch life times by many orders of magnitude for each additional unit by which the system changes beyond what is most allowed under the selection rules. Such excited states can last years, or even for many billions of years (too long to have been measured).\nSection::::In radioactive decay.\nSection::::In radioactive decay.:Gamma decay.\nThe most common mechanism for suppression of the rate of gamma decay of excited atomic nuclei, and thus make possible the existence of a metastable isomer for the nucleus, is lack of a decay route for the excited state that will change nuclear angular momentum (along any given direction) by the most common (allowed) amount of 1 quantum unit formula_1 of spin angular momentum. Such a change is necessary to emit a gamma-ray photon, which has a spin of 1 unit in this system. Integral changes of 2, 3, 4, and more units in angular momentum are possible (the emitted photons carry off the additional angular momentum), but changes of more than 1 unit are known as forbidden transitions. Each degree of forbiddenness (additional unit of spin change larger than 1, that the emitted gamma ray must carry) inhibits decay rate by about 5 orders of magnitude. The highest known spin change of 8 units occurs in the decay of Ta-180m, which suppresses its decay by a factor of 10 from that associated with 1 unit, so that instead of a natural gamma decay half life of 10 seconds, it has a half life of more than 10 seconds, or at least 3 x 10 years, and thus has yet to be observed to decay.\nAlthough gamma decays with nuclear angular momentum changes of 2, 3, 4, etc., are forbidden, they are only relatively forbidden, and do proceed, but with a slower rate than the normal allowed change of 1 unit. However, gamma emission is absolutely forbidden when the nucleus begins in a zero-spin state, as such an emission would not conserve angular momentum. These transitions cannot occur by gamma decay, but must proceed by another route, such as beta decay in some cases, or internal conversion where beta decay is not favored.\nSection::::In radioactive decay.:Beta decay.\nBeta decay is classified according to the -value of the emitted radiation. Unlike gamma decay, beta decay may proceed from a nucleus with a spin of zero and even parity to a nucleus also with a spin of zero and even parity (Fermi transition). This is possible because the electron and neutrino emitted may be of opposing spin (giving a radiation total angular momentum of zero), thus preserving angular momentum of the initial state even if the nucleus remains at spin-zero before and after emission. This type of emission is super-allowed meaning that it is the most rapid type of beta decay in nuclei that are susceptible to a change in proton/neutron ratios that accompanies a beta decay process.\nThe next possible total angular momentum of the electron and neutrino emitted in beta decay is a combined spin of 1 (electron and neutrino spinning in the same direction), and is allowed. This type of emission (Gamow-Teller transition) changes nuclear spin by 1 to compensate. States involving higher angular momenta of the emitted radiation (2, 3, 4, etc.) are forbidden and are ranked in degree of forbiddenness by their increasing angular momentum.\nSpecifically, when the decay is referred to as forbidden. Nuclear selection rules require L-values greater than two to be accompanied by changes in both nuclear spin\u00a0() and parity\u00a0(\u03c0). The selection rules for the th forbidden transitions are\nwhere or corresponds to no parity change or parity change, respectively. As noted, the special case of a Fermi 0 \u2192 0 transition (which in gamma decay is absolutely forbidden) is referred to as super-allowed for beta decay, and proceeds very quickly if beta decay is possible. The following table lists the \u0394 and \u0394\u03c0 values for the first few values of\u00a0:\nAs with gamma decay, each degree of increasing forbiddenness increases the half life of the beta decay process involved by a factor of about 4 to 5 orders of magnitude.\nDouble beta decay has been observed in the laboratory, e.g. in . Geochemical experiments have also found this rare type of forbidden decay in several isotopes. with mean half lives over 10\u00a0yr ."], "wikipedia-30436": ["GR is a theoretical framework that only focuses on gravity for understanding the universe in regions of both large scale and high mass: stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc. On the other hand, QFT is a theoretical framework that only focuses on three non-gravitational forces for understanding the universe in regions of both small scale and low mass: sub-atomic particles, atoms, molecules, etc. QFT successfully implemented the Standard Model that describes the three non-gravitational forces: strong, weak, and electromagnetic force.\n\nThrough years of research, physicists have experimentally confirmed with tremendous accuracy virtually every prediction made by these two theories when in their appropriate domains of applicability.

One approach is bottom-up methods, in particular agglomerative or hierarchical clustering [10, 11, 14, 34]. The other is top-down methods, in particular K-means [4, 8, 23]. In practice, agglomerative methods have not been found to scale to realistic collection sizes, and reported experiments on large collections all seem to use K-means. We therefore use we use K-means for the work in this paper. Although the robustness ofK-means has been questioned, for example with regard to stability and the potential to fall into local minima rather than produce globally optimal outcomes, in a separate project (manuscript in submission) we have observed reasonably stable performance. In brief, inK-means clustering an expected number of clusters, k, is chosen. Initiallyk documents are chosen as seeds, and each document in the collection is allocated to the cluster for which the seed is the nearest neighbour. At each subsequent iteration, the centroid of each cluster is computed; this is the average of the allocated documents. The documents are then allocated again to the cluster with the nearest centroid. This repeats until an iteration limit is reached or the process converges, that is, the clusters are unchanged between iterations. The value of k can be optimised by exploring behaviour as k is varied, for example with the Elbow method [27], but in this work we use fixedk based on results in the separate project mentioned above.\n\nTopic modelling. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic Bayesian approach to topic modelling proposed by Blei et al. [3]. In contrast to K-means clustering, documents are assumed to be comprised of multiple topics. Intuitively, topics are distinguished by the different degrees to which they are associated with words in the vocabulary; a word that is prominent in one topic may be insignificant in another. The approach assumes that a collection covers a known number m of topics and that each document is a blend of a subset of these topics. It also assumes that there is an underlying data generation process in which, first, the topics of a document follows a multinomial distribution, controlled by a common Dirichlet prior for the collection; and second, for each of the topics, the words are generated from another multinomial distribution, controlled by a Dirchlet prior that is shared among topics. The two distributions are assumed to be independent."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-39127306": 2, "wikipedia-382331": 1, "wikipedia-3439285": 1, "wikipedia-57264039": 1, "wikipedia-5529757": 1, "wikipedia-45396428": 1, "wikipedia-49098434": 1, "wikipedia-34564244": 1, "wikipedia-30436": 2, "wikipedia-619345": 1, "arxiv-2306.03938": 1, "arxiv-quant-ph/0508100": 1, "arxiv-math/0507288": 1, "arxiv-0909.2626": 1, "arxiv-2009.05245": 1, "arxiv-1501.06835": 1, "arxiv-1607.07589": 1, "arxiv-1707.04241": 1, "arxiv-1411.6148": 1, "arxiv-0706.0030": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/1": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-39127306": 3, "wikipedia-382331": 1, "wikipedia-3439285": 2, "wikipedia-57264039": 1, "wikipedia-5529757": 1, "wikipedia-45396428": 1, "wikipedia-49098434": 1, "wikipedia-34564244": 1, "wikipedia-30436": 3, "wikipedia-619345": 2, "arxiv-2306.03938": 1, "arxiv-quant-ph/0508100": 1, "arxiv-math/0507288": 1, "arxiv-0909.2626": 1, "arxiv-2009.05245": 1, "arxiv-1501.06835": 1, "arxiv-1607.07589": 1, "arxiv-1707.04241": 1, "arxiv-1411.6148": 1, "arxiv-0706.0030": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/1": 1}}}

These are\nintended to give a human-interpretable description of the semantics\nof the topic. In contrast to some of the work discussed above, in our\nresearch clusters are represented with keywords and are determined\nindependently of consideration of topic models.\nKeywords from central documents (central keywords). A standard\nvisual explanation of clusters is a presentation of them as multiple\nclouds of dots in a two-dimensional space. The clouds overlap but,\nappealingly, are sufficiently distinct that they can be perceived\nas organic units \u2013 an effect that can be enhanced through use of\ndifferent colours. A feature in some of these visualisations is that\nthe dot-clouds are more crowded at the centre, just as a galaxy is\ndense in the middle and sparse at the edges.\nThe intuition the dot-cloud metaphor suggests is that there are\nsome archetypal items (documents in this study) at the centre of\neach cluster that can stand as ideotypes for the whole. In the first\nof our two approaches to generating representative word lists, we\nassume that the documents that are closest to the centroid are a\ngood proxy for the whole, so that word lists generated from those\ndocuments will be informative about the cluster.\nIn detail, the Cosine distance between each document in the\ncluster and the centroid is calculated. We select the top 10 docu-\nments closest to the centroid and pool them, and select the top\n(highest-weighted) N words as the representative keywords.\nKeywords by all documents of a cluster (cluster keywords).

Intuitively, this is an appealing approach if the docu-\nments are reasonably homogeneous but \u2013 considering the dot-cloud\nmetaphor again \u2013 the documents that are remote from the centroid\nmay be on rare subjects and be distant from the other documents in\nthe cluster. That is, they may dilute the topical integrity that might\nbe observed closer to the cluster\u2019s centre.

There are several approaches to term selection, such as ranking words in a topic by pairwise mutual information (PMI) and selecting the highest-scored for presentation [25], or use of graph-based topic descriptors [6], which however are not directly suitable for human consumption. In this initial work, we take a simple \u2018topN \u2019 approach to selecting lists of keywords, but note that there are richer methods that are argued to give results that are better appreciated by humans.

A variety of visual aids \u2013 especially graphs and network diagrams \u2013 make it easier to detect sequence patterns. One visual aid, known as a \"transition plot,\" replace the numbers in the cells of a transition matrix with a visual symbol that reflects the magnitude of the relationship between two given states or phenomena. In this kind of graph, the symbols size or shape varies with the corresponding transition probabilities. Transitions that occur within a set of sequences can also be depicted using a network-like diagram called a \"state transition diagram\", which displays elements as nodes in a network. This way, relationships between elements can be emphasized using graphical aids, such as by adjusting the thickness of lines between states. Transition plots and state transition diagrams are useful for depicting patterns of first-order (Markovian) transitions. They do not provide information about when transitions occur or overall sequence patterns. One visual aid that is useful in both of these respects is the \"sequence index plot\", an example of which is provided on the right side of this page. This kind of graph displays every sequence in the sample. The y-axis includes all of the observations, stacked on top of each other. The x-axis depicts the sequence positions in order. The observations in the sequence index plot are arranged such that cases with the same sequence order are grouped adjacent to each other on the y-axis. A similar graph, called the \"state distribution graph\", can be used to simplify the patterns that are latent in sequence index plots. Like sequence index plots, state distribution graphs array sequence positions in order along the x-axis. The main difference is that the y-axis contains not individual cases, but the prevalence of each element at each position on the x-axis. A special type of state distribution graph is the \"tempogram\", which is designed specifically for temporally ordered sequence data. Finally, sequences are often depicted as networks, in which multiple subjects\u2019 sequences are shown to intersect with each other art specific events or instances.

In this kind of graph, the symbols size or shape varies with the corresponding transition probabilities. Transitions that occur within a set of sequences can also be depicted using a network-like diagram called a \"state transition diagram\", which displays elements as nodes in a network. This way, relationships between elements can be emphasized using graphical aids, such as by adjusting the thickness of lines between states. Transition plots and state transition diagrams are useful for depicting patterns of first-order (Markovian) transitions. They do not provide information about when transitions occur or overall sequence patterns. One visual aid that is useful in both of these respects is the \"sequence index plot\", an example of which is provided on the right side of this page. This kind of graph displays every sequence in the sample. The y-axis includes all of the observations, stacked on top of each other. The x-axis depicts the sequence positions in order. The observations in the sequence index plot are arranged such that cases with the same sequence order are grouped adjacent to each other on the y-axis. A similar graph, called the \"state distribution graph\", can be used to simplify the patterns that are latent in sequence index plots. Like sequence index plots, state distribution graphs array sequence positions in order along the x-axis. The main difference is that the y-axis contains not individual cases, but the prevalence of each element at each position on the x-axis. A special type of state distribution graph is the \"tempogram\", which is designed specifically for temporally ordered sequence data.

In KM software, taxonomies are often used as a way of visually structuring the available information by tagging it with relevant topics and visually represent them as folders and sub-folders inside the taxonomy. Users can then navigate the taxonomy and select the topic, or combination of topics (faceted search), to perform the search on.\nBULLET::::- Tag Cloud search - Once text data has been tagged with certain topics it can be visually represented as a Tag Cloud, where the importance of each tag is represented as a font size and/or color. This way you can identify and pick the most prominent topics.\nBULLET::::- Matrix/Heat Map search - The classification of information into topics facilitates visualization and analysis of the information flow.

A feature in some of these visualisations is that the dot-clouds are more crowded at the centre, just as a galaxy is dense in the middle and sparse at the edges.\nThe intuition the dot-cloud metaphor suggests is that there are some archetypal items (documents in this study) at the centre of each cluster that can stand as ideotypes for the whole. In the first of our two approaches to generating representative word lists, we assume that the documents that are closest to the centroid are a good proxy for the whole, so that word lists generated from those documents will be informative about the cluster.\nIn detail, the Cosine distance between each document in the cluster and the centroid is calculated.

Both of these approaches are well known and have been used in IR for a variety of tasks. Clustering has been proposed as a mechanism for supporting retrieval directly via iterative collection narrowing and indirectly as an enhancement to retrieval models [19, 28, 29]. Applications of topic modelling include document representation and collection summarization; it has not been widely used for collection partitioning, but note that we do not explore that problem here. Topic models have however been used to improve the performance of clustering in a variety of ways [9, 22, 33]. Our goal is to compare clustering and topic modelling as description tools, using a newswire collection as a case study. There are three main contributions in this work. First, we compare two simple cluster labelling methods, which are intended to create compact thematic representations of their contents. Second, on this collection, and subsets of it, we show that there is significant alignment between cluster membership and the major topic labels of documents. We regard this is as a highly surprising result, as the methods of creating these representations is very different. As we show, the alignment can be observed in two different ways: through the dominance of specific topics within individual clusters, and through inspection of the significant words in clusters and topics. That is, in a complementary way we have compared clustering to topic modelling by mapping them in both directions. Third, we use the topic\u2013cluster alignment to demonstrate that, in this case study at least, the words in documents that are close to the centroids of clusters are a poor representative of the cluster as a whole. We hypothesise that this arises because even the nearest document to a centroid may be relatively distant, and may be close to the centroid on dimensions that are untypical of the cluster as a whole; this kind of counter-intuitive behaviour easily arises in high-dimensional data. The results of our case study show that the clustering and topic-modelling methods can be mutually confirming and appear to be generating semantically meaningful representations, while also suggesting that there are limits to the assertions that can be made about how distinct different topics, and different clusters, are from each other. We believe that these results establish the need for a more systematic investigation of the topic\u2013cluster relationship and that, if confirmed, it can provide the basis of rich mechanisms for exploration of document collections."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

There are 15 chapters in total, and the following outline the main points.\nSection::::Chapter summary.:The Truth about Relativity.\nIn chapter 1, Ariely describes the ways in which people frequently regard their environment in terms of their relation to others; it is the way that the human brain is wired. People not only compare things, but also compare things that are easily comparable. For example, if given the following options for a honeymoon - Paris (with free breakfast), Rome (with free breakfast), and Rome (no breakfast included), most people would probably choose Rome with the free breakfast. The rationale is that it is easier to compare the two options for Rome than it is to compare Paris and Rome. Ariely also explains the role of the decoy effect (or asymmetric dominance effect) in the decision process. The decoy effect is the phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented with a third option that is asymmetrically dominated. This effect is the \"secret agent\" in many decisions. In the example with the honeymoon options, Rome without free breakfast is the decoy. (It makes Rome with breakfast look superior to Rome without breakfast. Comparing Rome and Paris is difficult, so the easy comparison of Rome makes it more likely to choose Rome over Paris.) It makes Paris look inferior when compared to Rome with the free breakfast. Relativity helps people make decisions but it can also make them miserable. People compare their lives to those of others, leading to jealousy and inferiority. Ariely finishes the chapter by saying \"the more we have, the more we want\" and his suggested cure is to break the cycle of relativity. To break the cycle, people can control what goes on around them. The focus on smaller \"circles\" can boost relative happiness, as can changing this focus from narrow to broad. When considering upgrading a phone, the consumer could think about what else they could buy with the money they would spend on the upgrade.\nThe chapter also explores the independence of irrelevant alternatives and the idea of menu dependence.\nSection::::Chapter summary.:The Fallacy of Supply and Demand.\nIn chapter 2, consumers purchase items based on value, quality or availability \u2013 often on all three. The methods of appointing a value to an object with no previous value, like the Tahitian black pearl, is susceptible to irrational pricing. A value can be as easily (arbitrarily) assigned as by having a fancy ad with \"equally\" precious items and a high price tag in a window of a store on Fifth Avenue. When consumers buy a product at a certain price, they become \"anchored\" to that price, i.e. they associate the initial price with the same product over a period of time. An anchor price of a certain object, say a plasma television, will affect the way they perceive the value of all plasma televisions henceforth. Other prices will seem low or high in relation to the original anchor. In other words, decisions about future LCD television purchases become coherent after an initial price has been established in the consumer's mind. A person's self value for services rendered can also be affected by anchor prices; one can irrationally price his/her abilities or services based on an anchor price proposed. Using the concepts of anchor price and arbitrary coherence, Ariely challenges the theory of supply and demand. He states that demand, the determinant of market prices, can be easily manipulated. Furthermore, supply and demand are dependent on each other (manufacturer's suggested retail prices affect consumers' willingness to pay). Finally, the author claims that the relationships between supply and demand are based on memory rather than on preferences.\nSection::::Chapter summary.:The Cost of Zero Cost.\nIn chapter 3, Ariely explains how humans react to the words \"free\" and \"zero\". Humans make decisions without rationalizing the outcomes of their choices. To illustrate this point, Ariely conducted multiple experiments. The outcome was consistent: when faced with multiple choices, the free option was commonly chosen. With the opportunity to receive something for free, the actual value of the product or service is no longer considered. Ariely claims, \"Most transactions have an upside and a downside, but when something is FREE! we forget the downside. FREE! gives us such an emotional charge that we perceive what is being offered as immensely more valuable than it really is.\"\nAriely's concept of \"FREE!\" applies not only to monetary and quantitative costs, but also to time. We forgo some of our time when we wait in line for free popcorn or to enter a museum on a free-entrance day. We could have been doing something else at that time. Ultimately, he demonstrates how such a simple concept can be used to drive business and social policy. For example, to reduce health cost, companies could offer free regular checks. Employees would be more willing to get them at zero cost rather than paying some amount of money. Ariely recommends the consideration of the net benefits of the choices we make regarding both preference and money. Perhaps we would get the better deal and even save money if we did not react to free the way we do.\nSection::::Chapter summary.:Being Paid vs. A Friendly Favor.\nIn chapters 4 and 5, Ariely speaks in great detail of the differences between social norms\u2014which include friendly requests with instant payback not being required\u2014and market norms\u2014which account for wages, prices, rents, cost benefits, and repayment being essential.\nHe also explains how combining the two can create troubling situations. The author comments that people are happy to do things occasionally when they are not paid for them. In fact there are some situations in which work output is negatively affected by payment of small amounts of money. Tests showed that work done as a \"favor\" sometimes produced much better results than work paid for.\nFor example, some lawyers were asked by AARP to provide needy retirees with services at a cost of about $30. The lawyers did not accept the offer. However, when asked to offer services at no cost, they agreed. Experiments also showed that offering a small gift would not offend anybody (the gift falls into social norms), but mentioning the monetary value of the gifts invokes market norms.\nAriely talks about how social norms are making their way into the market norms. To illustrate, State Farm's slogan, \"Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there,\" provides an example where companies are trying to connect with people on a social level in order to gain trust and allow the customer to overlook minor infractions. The author concludes that \"money, as it turns out, is the most expensive way to motivate people. Social norms are not only cheaper, but often more effective as well.\"\nSection::::Chapter summary.:Emotion in Decision Making.\nIn chapter 6, Ariely collaborated with close friend George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, to test the influence of arousal on decision making in high-emotion situations. Ariely and Loewenstein chose to test the effects of sexual arousal on decision-making in college-aged men at University of California, Berkeley. By using computers to stimulate sexual arousal, they determined that in a stimulated state, the young men were more likely to undergo an action that they would not normally consider. Using the data, Ariely argues that other high-emotion situations such as anger, frustration, and hunger have the potential to trigger similar effects on decision-making. In such situations our behavior is fully controlled by emotions. We are not the people we thought we were. No matter how much experience we have we make irrational decisions every time we are under the influence of arousal. Furthermore, he presents ideas to improve our decision-making abilities in other emotion-provoking situations such as safe sex, safe driving, and making other life decisions. For example, Ariely proposes an OnStar system that could potentially lower the number of car accidents in teenagers by performing tasks such as changing the car's temperature or dialing the teenager's mother when the car exceeds a set speed.\nSection::::Chapter summary.:The Problem of Procrastination and Self-control.\nIn chapter 7, over the last decade Americans have shown surprisingly little self-control. Ariely blames this lack of self-control on people's two states in which they make their judgments\u2014cool state and hot state. In our cool state we make rational long-term decisions, whereas in our hot state we give in to immediate gratification and put off our decisions made in the cool state.\nAriely describes putting off these goals for immediate gratification as procrastination. With proper motivators such as deadlines and penalties, people are more willing to meet deadlines or long-term goals. The author states that based on his experience with his students, deadlines set by authority figures such as teachers and supervisors make us start working on a specific task earlier. If we set the deadlines ourselves, we might not perform well. Moreover, we will not start making any progress towards the completion of the task until the deadline approaches.\nAriely also applies his theories to other aspects in life such as health care and savings"], "wikipedia-27555228": ["The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom is a 2006 psychology book by Jonathan Haidt written for a general audience.

Our interpretation is that both are somewhat effective in gathering information by theme, and, moreover, it does appear that there are true underlying themes that can be meaningfully gathered. However, clustering and topic modelling are not equivalent. Topic modelling is arguably richer, in that it provides a multifaceted description of each document; here we have focused on the dominant topic in each document, but other topics can be significant. The obverse of this observation is that some topics can assist in description of many documents but never be dominant, which is a common feature of topic models. As a consequence \u2013 for the purposes of comparing clustering and topic modelling, at least \u2013 the effective number of topics is reduced. Another perspective on this observation is that clustering can create subcategories of documents that share a dominant topic, while topic modelling supplements clustering by identifying subtopics. Some clusters are a mix of topics, with no one topic well represented, and large clusters are less likely to have a strongly dominant topic than are small clusters. As noted above, this suggests that topic modelling can be used to test the cohesion of a cluster. The \u2018central keywords\u2019 method for generating textual descriptions was not successful.

Instead, on this collection topic models and clusters showed a remarkable degree of alignment. Most clusters are largely composed of documents with the same dominant topic, and topic keyword lists and cluster keyword lists are often near-identical. That is, both directions \u2013 transforming topics to clusters, and transforming clusters to word lists \u2013 yield results that are substantially aligned. To our knowledge, there has been no previous comparison of topic modelling and clustering in this mutual way.\nWe examined two elementary methods for cluster labelling, of which one \u2013 simply, the highest-weighted words in each centroid \u2013 appears to have been highly effective. Another outcome was that the results show that topics are useful for illuminating the structure of clusters, and vice versa, and suggest that there are limits to claims on how distinct different topics or clusters are from each other. Surprisingly, what is arguably the simplest cluster labelling method in the literature showed good similarity to topic modelling.\nThis suggests, for example, that topic modelling might provide an automatic guide to the quality of cluster labelling.\nThe work reported here suggests several next steps. One is the obvious generalisation from a case study to a more comprehensive study, in which the alignments and levels of mutual support are explored in quantitative terms, a wider range of document types is considered, and so on. Another is to explore how these techniques can be used to inform each other and be mutually strengthened. A third is to examine methods for exploiting the representations they generate to support user navigation during search. However, our results have already established a link between the methods that had not previously been identified, a link that gives confidence in the robustness of both clustering and topic modelling as tools for analysis of document collections."], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": ["Our goal is to compare clustering and topic modelling as description tools, using a newswire collection as a case study. There are three main contributions in this work. First, we compare two simple cluster labelling methods, which are intended to create compact thematic representations of their contents. Second, on this collection, and subsets of it, we show that there is significant alignment between cluster membership and the major topic labels of documents. We regard this is as a highly surprising result, as the methods of creating these representations is very different. As we show, the alignment can be observed in two different ways: through the dominance of specific topics within individual clusters, and through inspection of the significant words in clusters and topics. That is, in a complementary way we have compared clustering to topic modelling by mapping them in both directions.\nThird, we use the topic\u2013cluster alignment to demonstrate that, in this case study at least, the words in documents that are close to the centroids of clusters are a poor representative of the cluster as a whole. We hypothesise that this arises because even the nearest document to a centroid may be relatively distant, and may be close to the centroid on dimensions that are untypical of the cluster as a whole; this kind of counter-intuitive behaviour easily arises in high-dimensional data.\nThe results of our case study show that the clustering and topic-modelling methods can be mutually confirming and appear to be generating semantically meaningful representations, while also suggesting that there are limits to the assertions that can be made about how distinct different topics, and different clusters, are from each other. We believe that these results establish the need for a more systematic investigation of the topic\u2013cluster relationship and that, if confirmed, it can provide the basis of rich mechanisms for exploration of document collections."], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": ["Our work explores topic modelling and clustering for information retrieval. We first describe these approaches, then review work in which they have been integrated. Clustering has a long history in IR, and up to the 1980s was regarded as a plausible search mechanism, under which, it was supposed, users would iteratively navigate to ever smaller clusters rather than issue a query. While such approaches did not continue to be explored, as collections grew in size and index-based search technology matured, there has been ongoing interest in clustering in its own right and as a support for a range of search-related tasks. A range of mechanisms have been proposed for clustering. One approach is bottom-up methods, in particular agglomerative or hierarchical clustering. The other is top-down methods, in particular K-means. In practice, agglomerative methods have not been found to scale to realistic collection sizes, and reported experiments on large collections all seem to use K-means. We therefore use we use K-means for the work in this paper. Topic modelling. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic Bayesian approach to topic modelling proposed by Blei et al. In contrast to K-means clustering, documents are assumed to be comprised of multiple topics. Intuitively, topics are distinguished by the different degrees to which they are associated with words in the vocabulary; a word that is prominent in one topic may be insignificant in another."], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": ["Document collections can be characterised in a variety of ways. Two key approaches are clustering, which partitions collections into subcollections with the expectation that the contents will be thematically linked, and topic models, which describe the contents in terms of weighted lists of words that are expected to represent different themes. In this paper, we report experiments on the observed relationship between clusters and topic models in a preliminary study of a large text collection. Both produce results that appear cohesive in their own right, but surprisingly \u2013 given the very different ways in which they are formed \u2013 the descriptions of the collections that they generate are strongly similar. This unexpected mutual reinforcement creates confidence in both approaches as tools for annotating and describing the contents of document collections."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-556400": 1, "wikipedia-39006227": 1, "wikipedia-1325828": 1, "wikipedia-24891442": 1, "wikipedia-99494": 1, "wikipedia-30454732": 1, "wikipedia-42431426": 1, "wikipedia-18421485": 1, "wikipedia-27555228": 1, "wikipedia-626514": 1, "arxiv-hep-ph/0510095": 1, "arxiv-2308.10220": 1, "arxiv-2201.07794": 1, "arxiv-hep-ph/0502012": 1, "arxiv-0709.0690": 1, "arxiv-1310.2522": 1, "arxiv-2305.16000": 1, "arxiv-2103.14491": 1, "arxiv-0812.1534": 1, "arxiv-gr-qc/0611123": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/6": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/1": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-556400": 1, "wikipedia-39006227": 1, "wikipedia-1325828": 1, "wikipedia-24891442": 1, "wikipedia-99494": 1, "wikipedia-30454732": 1, "wikipedia-42431426": 1, "wikipedia-18421485": 2, "wikipedia-27555228": 2, "wikipedia-626514": 1, "arxiv-hep-ph/0510095": 1, "arxiv-2308.10220": 1, "arxiv-2201.07794": 1, "arxiv-hep-ph/0502012": 1, "arxiv-0709.0690": 1, "arxiv-1310.2522": 1, "arxiv-2305.16000": 1, "arxiv-2103.14491": 1, "arxiv-0812.1534": 1, "arxiv-gr-qc/0611123": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/6": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/1": 1}}}

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic Bayesian approach to topic modelling proposed by Blei et al. [3]. In contrast to K-means clustering, documents are assumed to be comprised of multiple topics. Intuitively, topics are distinguished by the different degrees to which they are associated with words in the vocabulary; a word that is prominent in one topic may be insignificant in another. The approach assumes that a collection covers a known number m of topics and that each document is a blend of a subset of these topics. It also assumes that there is an underlying data generation process in which, first, the topics of a document follows a multinomial distribution, controlled by a common Dirichlet prior for the collection; and second, for each of the topics, the words are generated from another multinomial distribution, controlled by a Dirchlet prior that is shared among topics.

For example, the following methods can be used to assess the quality of clustering algorithms based on internal criterion:\nBULLET::::- Davies\u2013Bouldin index\nBULLET::::- Dunn index\nBULLET::::- Silhouette coefficient\nSection::::Evaluation and assessment.:External evaluation.\nIn external evaluation, clustering results are evaluated based on data that was not used for clustering, such as known class labels and external benchmarks. Such benchmarks consist of a set of pre-classified items, and these sets are often created by (expert) humans. Thus, the benchmark sets can be thought of as a gold standard for evaluation. These types of evaluation methods measure how close the clustering is to the predetermined benchmark classes. However, it has recently been discussed whether this is adequate for real data, or only on synthetic data sets with a factual ground truth, since classes can contain internal structure, the attributes present may not allow separation of clusters or the classes may contain anomalies. Additionally, from a knowledge discovery point of view, the reproduction of known knowledge may not necessarily be the intended result. In the special scenario of constrained clustering, where meta information (such as class labels) is used already in the clustering process, the hold-out of information for evaluation purposes is non-trivial.\nA number of measures are adapted from variants used to evaluate classification tasks. In place of counting the number of times a class was correctly assigned to a single data point (known as true positives), such \"pair counting\" metrics assess whether each pair of data points that is truly in the same cluster is predicted to be in the same cluster.\nAs with internal evaluation, several external evaluation measures exist, for example:\nBULLET::::- Purity: Purity is a measure of the extent to which clusters contain a single class. Its calculation can be thought of as follows: For each cluster, count the number of data points from the most common class in said cluster. Now take the sum over all clusters and divide by the total number of data points. Formally, given some set of clusters formula_16 and some set of classes formula_17, both partitioning formula_18 data points, purity can be defined as:\nBULLET::::- Rand measure (William M. Rand 1971)\nBULLET::::- F-measure\nBULLET::::- Jaccard index\nBULLET::::- Dice index\nBULLET::::- Fowlkes\u2013Mallows index (E. B. Fowlkes & C. L. Mallows 1983)\nBULLET::::- The mutual information is an information theoretic measure of how much information is shared between a clustering and a ground-truth classification that can detect a non-linear similarity between two clusterings. Normalized mutual information is a family of corrected-for-chance variants of this that has a reduced bias for varying cluster numbers.\nBULLET::::- Confusion matrix"], "wikipedia-22117223": ["Silhouette refers to a method of interpretation and validation of consistency within clusters of data. The technique provides a succinct graphical representation of how well each object has been classified. The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from \u22121 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. If most objects have a high value, then the clustering configuration is appropriate. If many points have a low or negative value, then the clustering configuration may have too many or too few clusters. The silhouette can be calculated with any distance metric, such as the Euclidean distance or the Manhattan distance. Assume the data have been clustered via any technique, such as k-means, into formula_1 clusters. For each data point formula_2 (data point formula_3 in the cluster formula_4), let to be the \"smallest\" (hence the formula_6 operator in the formula) mean distance of formula_3 to all points in any other cluster, of which formula_3 is not a member. The cluster with this smallest mean dissimilarity is said to be the \"neighbouring cluster\" of formula_3 because it is the next best fit cluster for point formula_3. The mean formula_18 over all points of a cluster is a measure of how tightly grouped all the points in the cluster are. Thus the mean formula_18 over all data of the entire dataset is a measure of how appropriately the data have been clustered. If there are too many or too few clusters, as may occur when a poor choice of formula_1 is used in the clustering algorithm (e.g.: k-means), some of the clusters will typically display much narrower silhouettes than the rest. Thus silhouette plots and means may be used to determine the natural number of clusters within a dataset. One can also increase the likelihood of the silhouette being maximized at the correct number of clusters by re-scaling the data using feature weights that are cluster specific."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

While the explanation may not be exhaustive, it offers a starting point for understanding these concepts.", "wikipedia-669675": ["More than a dozen of internal evaluation measures exist, usually based on the intuition that items in the same cluster should be more similar than items in different clusters. For example, the following methods can be used to assess the quality of clustering algorithms based on internal criterion:\nBULLET::::- Davies\u2013Bouldin index\nBULLET::::- Dunn index\nBULLET::::- Silhouette coefficient\nSection::::Evaluation and assessment.:External evaluation.\nIn external evaluation, clustering results are evaluated based on data that was not used for clustering, such as known class labels and external benchmarks. Such benchmarks consist of a set of pre-classified items, and these sets are often created by (expert) humans. Thus, the benchmark sets can be thought of as a gold standard for evaluation. These types of evaluation methods measure how close the clustering is to the predetermined benchmark classes. However, it has recently been discussed whether this is adequate for real data, or only on synthetic data sets with a factual ground truth, since classes can contain internal structure, the attributes present may not allow separation of clusters or the classes may contain anomalies. Additionally, from a knowledge discovery point of view, the reproduction of known knowledge may not necessarily be the intended result. In the special scenario of constrained clustering, where meta information (such as class labels) is used already in the clustering process, the hold-out of information for evaluation purposes is non-trivial.\nA number of measures are adapted from variants used to evaluate classification tasks. In place of counting the number of times a class was correctly assigned to a single data point (known as true positives), such \"pair counting\" metrics assess whether each pair of data points that is truly in the same cluster is predicted to be in the same cluster.\nAs with internal evaluation, several external evaluation measures exist, for example:\nBULLET::::- Purity: Purity is a measure of the extent to which clusters contain a single class. Its calculation can be thought of as follows: For each cluster, count the number of data points from the most common class in said cluster. Now take the sum over all clusters and divide by the total number of data points. Formally, given some set of clusters formula_16 and some set of classes formula_17, both partitioning formula_18 data points, purity can be defined as:\nBULLET::::- Rand measure (William M. Rand 1971)\nBULLET::::- F-measure\nBULLET::::- Jaccard index\nBULLET::::- Dice index\nBULLET::::- Fowlkes\u2013Mallows index (E. B. Fowlkes & C. L. Mallows 1983)\nBULLET::::- The mutual information is an information theoretic measure of how much information is shared between a clustering and a ground-truth classification that can detect a non-linear similarity between two clusterings. Normalized mutual information is a family of corrected-for-chance variants of this that has a reduced bias for varying cluster numbers.\nBULLET::::- Confusion matrix"], "wikipedia-22117223": ["The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from \u22121 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. If most objects have a high value, then the clustering configuration is appropriate. If many points have a low or negative value, then the clustering configuration may have too many or too few clusters.\n\nThe silhouette can be calculated with any distance metric, such as the Euclidean distance or the Manhattan distance.\n\nFor formula_18 to be close to 1 we require formula_19. As formula_20 is a measure of how dissimilar formula_3 is to its own cluster, a small value means it is well matched. Furthermore, a large formula_22 implies that formula_3 is badly matched to its neighbouring cluster. Thus an formula_18 close to one means that the data is appropriately clustered.\n\nIf formula_18 is close to negative one, then by the same logic we see that formula_3 would be more appropriate if it was clustered in its neighbouring cluster. An formula_18 near zero means that the datum is on the border of two natural clusters.\n\nThe mean formula_18 over all points of a cluster is a measure of how tightly grouped all the points in the cluster are. Thus the mean formula_18 over all data of the entire dataset is a measure of how appropriately the data have been clustered. If there are too many or too few clusters, as may occur when a poor choice of formula_1 is used in the clustering algorithm (e.g.: k-means), some of the clusters will typically display much narrower silhouettes than the rest. Thus silhouette plots and means may be used to determine the natural number of clusters within a dataset. One can also increase the likelihood of the silhouette being maximized at the correct number of clusters by re-scaling the data using feature weights that are cluster specific."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Two broad automatic approaches to characterisation of collections can be used to assist with this task. One of these is clustering, in which the collection is partitioned into subcollections with the goal of the subcollections being distinct from each other and more narrowly themed than is the collection as a whole. The other is topic modelling, in which each topic is a mapping from the set of terms (words) in the collections to a set of weights; the highly weighted words for a topic are anticipated to represent a semantic theme.\n\nIn this paper, as a case study of the potential value of clustering and topic modelling as descriptive tools we examine the relationship between them on a curated document collection. Both of these approaches are well known and have been used in IR for a variety of tasks. Clustering has been proposed as a mechanism for supporting retrieval directly via iterative collection narrowing and indirectly as an enhancement to retrieval models [19, 28, 29]. Applications of topic modelling include document representation and collection summarization; it has not been widely used for collection partitioning, but note that we do not explore that problem here. Topic models have however been used to improve the performance of clustering in a variety of ways [9, 22, 33].\n\nOur goal is to compare clustering and topic modelling as description tools, using a newswire collection as a case study. There are three main contributions in this work. First, we compare two simple cluster labelling methods, which are intended to create compact thematic representations of their contents. Second, on this collection, and subsets of it, we show that there is significant alignment between cluster membership and the major topic labels of documents. We regard this is as a highly surprising result, as the methods of creating these representations is very different. As we show, the alignment can be observed in two different ways: through the dominance of specific topics within individual clusters, and through inspection of the significant words in clusters and topics. That is, in a complementary way we have compared clustering to topic modelling by mapping them in both directions.\n\nThird, we use the topic\u2013cluster alignment to demonstrate that, in this case study at least, the words in documents that are close to the centroids of clusters are a poor representative of the cluster as a whole. We hypothesise that this arises because even the nearest document to a centroid may be relatively distant, and may be close to the centroid on dimensions that are untypical of the cluster as a whole; this kind of counter-intuitive behaviour easily arises in high-dimensional data.\n\nThe results of our case study show that the clustering and topic-modelling methods can be mutually confirming and appear to be generating semantically meaningful representations, while also suggesting that there are limits to the assertions that can be made about how distinct different topics, and different clusters, are from each other. We believe that these results establish the need for a more systematic investigation of the topic\u2013cluster relationship and that, if confirmed, it can provide the basis of rich mechanisms for exploration of document collections."], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": ["Words with high probabilities can be regarded as the keywords, or the signature, of a topic; by construction, different topics will tend to have very different keywords.

[22] explored an approach to in-tegration of topic modelling with clustering. They compared the performance of two topic modelling methods, pLSA and LDA, in the context of document clustering, considering two ways in which topic modelling and clustering can interact. The first is to represent documents with topic distributions and then use the topic distributions as vectors, replacing the original document vectors. The second is to treat topics as clusters and pick the topic with the highest probability as the predicted cluster for each document. However, Lu et al. did not make use of clustering algorithms, but instead treated a given partitioning as a collection of clusters; there was no exploration of the relationship between the approaches.\n\nXie and Xing [33] proposed a framework in which topic modelling and clustering were integrated, simultaneously learning the global topics of a collection and local topics in clusters. In addition to the LDA model, in which the document collection is represented as a mixture of topics [3], documents are partitioned into groups where each group (that is, cluster) has its own topic model with multiple local topics. This work shows that clusters can be described with the top-ranked words from local topics, in addition to the previously explored approach of describing the whole collection with global topics.\n\nContrasting these approaches, in the work of Lu et al.

In our first experiment, we examine the topic composition of clusters, aiming to match topics with clusters.

Hence, a document has a cluster label and a dominant-topic label and in effect we are using topic modelling as a form of clustering."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-14663145": 1, "wikipedia-14647485": 1, "wikipedia-28934119": 1, "wikipedia-33792090": 1, "wikipedia-46293997": 1, "wikipedia-34073580": 1, "wikipedia-1256148": 1, "wikipedia-13200719": 1, "wikipedia-15261743": 1, "wikipedia-2006113": 1, "arxiv-1309.6874": 1, "arxiv-2304.06653": 1, "arxiv-2012.08206": 1, "arxiv-2210.14763": 1, "arxiv-1610.07703": 1, "arxiv-2301.00818": 1, "arxiv-2309.01015": 1, "arxiv-1508.04562": 1, "arxiv-2107.03684": 1, "arxiv-2104.01115": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/6": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/7": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-14663145": 1, "wikipedia-14647485": 1, "wikipedia-28934119": 1, "wikipedia-33792090": 1, "wikipedia-46293997": 1, "wikipedia-34073580": 1, "wikipedia-1256148": 1, "wikipedia-13200719": 1, "wikipedia-15261743": 1, "wikipedia-2006113": 1, "arxiv-1309.6874": 1, "arxiv-2304.06653": 1, "arxiv-2012.08206": 1, "arxiv-2210.14763": 1, "arxiv-1610.07703": 1, "arxiv-2301.00818": 1, "arxiv-2309.01015": 1, "arxiv-1508.04562": 1, "arxiv-2107.03684": 1, "arxiv-2104.01115": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/6": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/7": 1}}}

While they may not cover every detailed decision, they can partially address the query by explaining general workflows and considerations.", "wikipedia-25202953": ["Cluster labeling\nIn natural language processing and information retrieval, cluster labeling is the problem of picking descriptive, human-readable labels for the clusters produced by a document clustering algorithm; standard clustering algorithms do not typically produce any such labels. Cluster labeling algorithms examine the contents of the documents per cluster to find a labeling that summarize the topic of each cluster and distinguish the clusters from each other.\n\nSection::::Differential cluster labeling.\nDifferential cluster labeling labels a cluster by comparing term distributions across clusters, using techniques also used for feature selection in document classification, such as mutual information and chi-squared feature selection. Terms having very low frequency are not the best in representing the whole cluster and can be omitted in labeling a cluster. By omitting those rare terms and using a differential test, one can achieve the best results with differential cluster labeling.\n\nSection::::Cluster-Internal Labeling.\nCluster-internal labeling selects labels that only depend on the contents of the cluster of interest. No comparison is made with the other clusters.\nCluster-internal labeling can use a variety of methods, such as finding terms that occur frequently in the centroid or finding the document that lies closest to the centroid.\n\nSection::::Cluster-Internal Labeling.:Centroid Labels.\nA frequently used model in the field of information retrieval is the vector space model, which represents documents as vectors. The entries in the vector correspond to terms in the vocabulary. Binary vectors have a value of 1 if the term is present within a particular document and 0 if it is absent. Many vectors make use of weights that reflect the importance of a term in a document, and/or the importance of the term in a document collection. For a particular cluster of documents, we can calculate the centroid by finding the arithmetic mean of all the document vectors. If an entry in the centroid vector has a high value, then the corresponding term occurs frequently within the cluster. These terms can be used as a label for the cluster.\n\nSection::::Cluster-Internal Labeling.:Title labels.\nAn alternative to centroid labeling is title labeling. Here, we find the document within the cluster that has the smallest Euclidean distance to the centroid, and use its title as a label for the cluster. One advantage to using document titles is that they provide additional information that would not be present in a list of terms. However, they also have the potential to mislead the user, since one document might not be representative of the entire cluster.\n\nSection::::Cluster-Internal Labeling.:External knowledge labels.\nCluster labeling can be done indirectly using external knowledge such as pre-categorized knowledge such as the one of Wikipedia. In such methods, a set of important cluster text features are first extracted from the cluster documents. These features then can be used to retrieve the (weighted) K-nearest categorized documents from which candidates for cluster labels can be extracted. The final step involves the ranking of such candidates. Suitable methods are such that are based on a voting or a fusion process which is determined using the set of categorized documents and the original cluster features.\n\nSection::::Cluster-Internal Labeling.:Combining Several Cluster Labelers.\nThe cluster labels of several different cluster labelers can be further combined to obtain better labels. \nFor example, Linear Regression can be used to learn an optimal combination of labeler scores. A more sophisticated technique is based on a fusion approach and analysis of the cluster labels decision stability of various labelers."], "wikipedia-14663145": ["In practice, document clustering often takes the following steps:\n1. Tokenization\nTokenization is the process of parsing text data into smaller units (tokens) such as words and phrases. Commonly used tokenization methods include Bag-of-words model and N-gram model.\n2. Stemming and lemmatization\nDifferent tokens might carry out similar information (e.g. tokenization and tokenizing). And we can avoid calculating similar information repeatedly by reducing all tokens to its base form using various stemming and lemmatization dictionaries.\n3. Removing stop words and punctuation\nSome tokens are less important than others. For instance, common words such as \"the\" might not be very helpful for revealing the essential characteristics of a text. So usually it is a good idea to eliminate stop words and punctuation marks before doing further analysis.\n4. Computing term frequencies or tf-idf\nAfter pre-processing the text data, we can then proceed to generate features. For document clustering, one of the most common ways to generate features for a document is to calculate the term frequencies of all its tokens. Although not perfect, these frequencies can usually provide some clues about the topic of the document. And sometimes it is also useful to weight the term frequencies by the inverse document frequencies. See tf-idf for detailed discussions.\n5. Clustering\nWe can then cluster different documents based on the features we have generated. See the algorithm section in cluster analysis for different types of clustering methods.\n6.

However, Wikipedia may lack depth on nuanced decisions (e.g., choosing hyperparameters, evaluating label quality) and practical trade-offs, which might require specialized sources.", "wikipedia-25202953": ["Cluster labeling\nIn natural language processing and information retrieval, cluster labeling is the problem of picking descriptive, human-readable labels for the clusters produced by a document clustering algorithm; standard clustering algorithms do not typically produce any such labels. Cluster labeling algorithms examine the contents of the documents per cluster to find a labeling that summarize the topic of each cluster and distinguish the clusters from each other.\nSection::::Differential cluster labeling.\nDifferential cluster labeling labels a cluster by comparing term distributions across clusters, using techniques also used for feature selection in document classification, such as mutual information and chi-squared feature selection. Terms having very low frequency are not the best in representing the whole cluster and can be omitted in labeling a cluster. By omitting those rare terms and using a differential test, one can achieve the best results with differential cluster labeling.\nSection::::Differential cluster labeling.:Pointwise mutual information.\nIn the fields of probability theory and information theory, mutual information measures the degree of dependence of two random variables. The mutual information of two variables and is defined as:\nformula_1\nwhere \"p(x, y)\" is the joint probability distribution of the two variables, \"p(x)\" is the probability distribution of X, and \"p(y)\" is the probability distribution of Y.\nIn the case of cluster labeling, the variable X is associated with membership in a cluster, and the variable Y is associated with the presence of a term. Both variables can have values of 0 or 1, so the equation can be rewritten as follows:\nformula_2\nIn this case, \"p(C = 1)\" represents the probability that a randomly selected document is a member of a particular cluster, and \"p(C = 0)\" represents the probability that it isn't. Similarly, \"p(T = 1)\" represents the probability that a randomly selected document contains a given term, and \"p(T = 0)\" represents the probability that it doesn't. The joint probability distribution function \"p(C, T)\" represents the probability that two events occur simultaneously. For example, \"p(0, 0)\" is the probability that a document isn't a member of cluster \"c\" and doesn't contain term \"t\"; \"p(0, 1)\" is the probability that a document isn't a member of cluster \"C\" and does contain term \"T\"; and so on.\nSection::::Differential cluster labeling.:Chi-Squared Selection.\nThe Pearson's chi-squared test can be used to calculate the probability that the occurrence of an event matches the initial expectations. In particular, it can be used to determine whether two events, A and B, are statistically independent. The value of the chi-squared statistic is:\nformula_3\nwhere \"O\" is the \"observed\" frequency of a and b co-occurring, and \"E\" is the \"expected\" frequency of co-occurrence.\nIn the case of cluster labeling, the variable A is associated with membership in a cluster, and the variable B is associated with the presence of a term. Both variables can have values of 0 or 1, so the equation can be rewritten as follows:\nformula_4\nFor example, \"O\" is the observed number of documents that are in a particular cluster but don't contain a certain term, and \"E\" is the expected number of documents that are in a particular cluster but don't contain a certain term.\nOur initial assumption is that the two events are independent, so the expected probabilities of co-occurrence can be calculated by multiplying individual probabilities:\n\"E = N * P(C = 1) * P(T = 0)\"\nwhere N is the total number of documents in the collection.\nSection::::Cluster-Internal Labeling.\nCluster-internal labeling selects labels that only depend on the contents of the cluster of interest. No comparison is made with the other clusters.\nCluster-internal labeling can use a variety of methods, such as finding terms that occur frequently in the centroid or finding the document that lies closest to the centroid.\nSection::::Cluster-Internal Labeling.:Centroid Labels.\nA frequently used model in the field of information retrieval is the vector space model, which represents documents as vectors. The entries in the vector correspond to terms in the vocabulary. Binary vectors have a value of 1 if the term is present within a particular document and 0 if it is absent. Many vectors make use of weights that reflect the importance of a term in a document, and/or the importance of the term in a document collection. For a particular cluster of documents, we can calculate the centroid by finding the arithmetic mean of all the document vectors. If an entry in the centroid vector has a high value, then the corresponding term occurs frequently within the cluster. These terms can be used as a label for the cluster.\nOne downside to using centroid labeling is that it can pick up words like \"place\" and \"word\" that have a high frequency in written text, but have little relevance to the contents of the particular cluster.\nSection::::Cluster-Internal Labeling.:Contextualized centroid labels.\nA simple, cost-effective way of overcoming the above limitation is to embed the centroid terms with the highest weight in a graph structure that provides a context for their interpretation and selection.\nIn this approach, a term-term co-occurrence matrix referred as formula_5 is first built for each cluster formula_6. Each cell represents the number of times term formula_7 co-occurs with term formula_8 within a certain window of text (a sentence, a paragraph, etc.)\nIn a second stage, a similarity matrix formula_9 is obtained by multiplying formula_5 with its transpose. We have formula_11. Being the dot product of two normalized vectors formula_12 and formula_13, formula_14 denotes the cosine similarity between terms formula_7 and formula_8. The so obtained formula_9 can then be used as the weighted adjacency matrix of a term similarity graph. The centroid terms are part of this graph, and they thus can be interpreted and scored by inspecting the terms that surround them in the graph.\nSection::::Cluster-Internal Labeling.:Title labels.\nAn alternative to centroid labeling is title labeling. Here, we find the document within the cluster that has the smallest Euclidean distance to the centroid, and use its title as a label for the cluster. One advantage to using document titles is that they provide additional information that would not be present in a list of terms. However, they also have the potential to mislead the user, since one document might not be representative of the entire cluster.\nSection::::Cluster-Internal Labeling.:External knowledge labels.\nCluster labeling can be done indirectly using external knowledge such as pre-categorized knowledge such as the one of Wikipedia. In such methods, a set of important cluster text features are first extracted from the cluster documents. These features then can be used to retrieve the (weighted) K-nearest categorized documents from which candidates for cluster labels can be extracted. The final step involves the ranking of such candidates. Suitable methods are such that are based on a voting or a fusion process which is determined using the set of categorized documents and the original cluster features.\nSection::::Cluster-Internal Labeling.:Combining Several Cluster Labelers.\nThe cluster labels of several different cluster labelers can be further combined to obtain better labels. \nFor example, Linear Regression can be used to learn an optimal combination of labeler scores. A more sophisticated technique is based on a fusion approach and analysis of the cluster labels decision stability of various labelers."], "wikipedia-46293997": ["BULLET::::- Dictionary Methods: the researcher pre-selects a set of keywords (n-gram) for each category. The machine then uses these keywords to classify each text unit into a category.\nBULLET::::- Individual Methods: the researcher pre-labels a sample of texts and trains a machine learning algorithm (i.e. SVM algorithm) using those labels. The machine labels the remainder of the observations by extrapolating information from the training set.\nBULLET::::- Ensemble Methods: instead of using only one machine-learning algorithm, the researcher trains a set of them and uses the resulting multiple labels to label the rest of the observations (see Collingwood and Wiklerson 2011 for more details).\nBULLET::::- Supervised Ideological Scaling (i.e. wordscores) is used to place different text units along an ideological continuum. The researcher selects two sets of texts that represent each ideological extreme, which the algorithm can use to identify words that belong to each extreme point. The remainder of the texts in the corpus are scaled depending on how many words of each extreme reference they contain.\nUnsupervised methods can be used when a set of categories for coding cannot be well-defined prior to analysis. Unlike supervised methods, human coders are not required to train the algorithm. One key choice for researchers when applying unsupervised methods is selecting the number of categories to sort documents into rather than defining what the categories are in advance. \nBULLET::::- Single membership models: these models automatically cluster texts into different categories that are mutually exclusive, and documents are coded into one and only one category. As pointed out by Grimmer and Stewart (16), \"each algorithm has three components: (1) a definition of document similarity or distance; (2) an objective function that operationalizes and ideal clustering; and (3) an optimization algorithm.\"\nBULLET::::- Mixed membership models: According also to Grimmer and Stewart (17), mixed membership models \"improve the output of single-membership models by including additional and problem-specific structure.\" Mixed membership FAC models classifies individual words within each document into categories, allowing the document as a whole to be a part of multiple categories simultaneously. Topic models represent one example of mixed membership FAC that can be used to analyze changes in focus of political actors or newspaper articles. One of the most used topic modeling technique is LDA.\nBULLET::::- Unsupervised Ideological Scaling (i.e. wordsfish): algorithms that allocate text units into an ideological continuum depending on shared grammatical content. Contrary to supervised scaling methods such as wordscores, methods such as wordfish do not require that the researcher provides samples of extreme ideological texts."], "wikipedia-14663145": ["Given a clustering, it can be beneficial to automatically derive human-readable labels for the clusters. Various methods exist for this purpose.\nSection::::Procedures.\nIn practice, document clustering often takes the following steps:\n1. Tokenization\nTokenization is the process of parsing text data into smaller units (tokens) such as words and phrases. Commonly used tokenization methods include Bag-of-words model and N-gram model.\n2. Stemming and lemmatization\nDifferent tokens might carry out similar information (e.g. tokenization and tokenizing). And we can avoid calculating similar information repeatedly by reducing all tokens to its base form using various stemming and lemmatization dictionaries.\n3. Removing stop words and punctuation\nSome tokens are less important than others. For instance, common words such as \"the\" might not be very helpful for revealing the essential characteristics of a text. So usually it is a good idea to eliminate stop words and punctuation marks before doing further analysis.\n4. Computing term frequencies or tf-idf\nAfter pre-processing the text data, we can then proceed to generate features. For document clustering, one of the most common ways to generate features for a document is to calculate the term frequencies of all its tokens. Although not perfect, these frequencies can usually provide some clues about the topic of the document. And sometimes it is also useful to weight the term frequencies by the inverse document frequencies. See tf-idf for detailed discussions.\n5. Clustering\nWe can then cluster different documents based on the features we have generated. See the algorithm section in cluster analysis for different types of clustering methods.\n6.

Clustering has a long history in IR, and up to the 1980s was regarded as a plausible search mechanism, under which, it was supposed, users would iteratively navigate to ever smaller clusters rather than issue a query [14, 30]. While such approaches did not continue to be explored, as collections grew in size and index-based search technology matured, there has been ongoing interest in clustering in its own right and as a support for a range of search-related tasks [2, 13, 15\u201317].\nA range of mechanisms have been proposed for clustering. One approach is bottom-up methods, in particular agglomerative or hier-archical clustering [10, 11, 14, 34]. The other is top-down methods, in particular K-means [4, 8, 23]. In practice, agglomerative methods have not been found to scale to realistic collection sizes, and reported experiments on large collections all seem to use K-means. We therefore use we use K-means for the work in this paper. Although the robustness ofK-means has been questioned, for example with regard to stability and the potential to fall into local minima rather than produce globally optimal outcomes, in a separate project (manuscript in submission) we have observed reasonably stable performance. In brief, inK-means clustering an expected number of clusters, k, is chosen. Initiallyk documents are chosen as seeds, and each document in the collection is allocated to the cluster for which the seed is the nearest neighbour. At each subsequent iteration, the centroid of each cluster is computed; this is the average of the allocated documents. The documents are then allocated again to the cluster with the nearest centroid. This repeats until an iteration limit is reached or the process converges, that is, the clusters are unchanged between iterations. The value of k can be optimised by exploring behaviour as k is varied, for example with the Elbow method [27], but in this work we use fixedk based on results in the separate project mentioned above.\nThe concept of \u2018nearest neighbour\u2019 requires a document representation. In the results reported here, we use a TFIDF calculation of word weights so that documents are represented as a vector whose dimensionality is |V |.

The second is to treat topics as clusters and pick the topic with the highest probability as the predicted cluster for each document. However, Lu et al. did not make use of clustering algorithms, but instead treated a given partitioning as a collection of clusters; there was no exploration of the relationship between the approaches. Xie and Xing [33] proposed a framework in which topic modelling and clustering were integrated, simultaneously learning the global topics of a collection and local topics in clusters. In addition to the LDA model, in which the document collection is represented as a mixture of topics [3], documents are partitioned into groups where each group (that is, cluster) has its own topic model with multiple local topics.

These are intended to give a human-interpretable description of the semantics of the topic. In contrast to some of the work discussed above, in our research clusters are represented with keywords and are determined independently of consideration of topic models. Keywords from central documents (central keywords). A standard visual explanation of clusters is a presentation of them as multiple clouds of dots in a two-dimensional space. The clouds overlap but, appealingly, are sufficiently distinct that they can be perceived as organic units \u2013 an effect that can be enhanced through use of different colours. A feature in some of these visualisations is that the dot-clouds are more crowded at the centre, just as a galaxy is dense in the middle and sparse at the edges. The intuition the dot-cloud metaphor suggests is that there are some archetypal items (documents in this study) at the centre of each cluster that can stand as ideotypes for the whole. In the first of our two approaches to generating representative word lists, we assume that the documents that are closest to the centroid are a good proxy for the whole, so that word lists generated from those documents will be informative about the cluster. In detail, the Cosine distance between each document in the cluster and the centroid is calculated. We select the top 10 documents closest to the centroid and pool them, and select the top (highest-weighted) N words as the representative keywords. Keywords by all documents of a cluster (cluster keywords). An alternative to using the documents that are close to the centre is to use them all. Intuitively, this is an appealing approach if the documents are reasonably homogeneous but \u2013 considering the dot-cloud metaphor again \u2013 the documents that are remote from the centroid may be on rare subjects and be distant from the other documents in the cluster. That is, they may dilute the topical integrity that might be observed closer to the cluster\u2019s centre. However, we thought this a useful alternative to explore. Straightforwardly, we determine the vector for a cluster as the average of all the vectors in the cluster \u2013 that is, we use the centroid.

We regard this is as a highly surprising result, as the methods of creating these representations is very different. As we show, the alignment can be observed in two different ways: through the dominance of specific topics within individual clusters, and through inspection of the significant words in clusters and topics. That is, in a complementary way we have compared clustering to topic modelling by mapping them in both directions.\nThird, we use the topic\u2013cluster alignment to demonstrate that, in this case study at least, the words in documents that are close to the centroids of clusters are a poor representative of the cluster as a whole.

A standard visual explanation of clusters is a presentation of them as multiple clouds of dots in a two-dimensional space. The clouds overlap but, appealingly, are sufficiently distinct that they can be perceived as organic units \u2013 an effect that can be enhanced through use of different colours. A feature in some of these visualisations is that the dot-clouds are more crowded at the centre, just as a galaxy is dense in the middle and sparse at the edges. The intuition the dot-cloud metaphor suggests is that there are some archetypal items (documents in this study) at the centre of each cluster that can stand as ideotypes for the whole. In the first of our two approaches to generating representative word lists, we assume that the documents that are closest to the centroid are a good proxy for the whole, so that word lists generated from those documents will be informative about the cluster.

A standard visual explanation of clusters is a presentation of them as multiple clouds of dots in a two-dimensional space. The clouds overlap but, appealingly, are sufficiently distinct that they can be perceived as organic units \u2013 an effect that can be enhanced through use of different colours. A feature in some of these visualisations is that the dot-clouds are more crowded at the centre, just as a galaxy is dense in the middle and sparse at the edges.\nThe intuition the dot-cloud metaphor suggests is that there are some archetypal items (documents in this study) at the centre of each cluster that can stand as ideotypes for the whole. In the first of our two approaches to generating representative word lists, we assume that the documents that are closest to the centroid are a good proxy for the whole, so that word lists generated from those documents will be informative about the cluster.\nIn detail, the Cosine distance between each document in the cluster and the centroid is calculated. We select the top 10 documents closest to the centroid and pool them, and select the top (highest-weighted) N words as the representative keywords.\n\nKeywords by all documents of a cluster (cluster keywords). An alternative to using the documents that are close to the centre is to use them all. Intuitively, this is an appealing approach if the documents are reasonably homogeneous but \u2013 considering the dot-cloud metaphor again \u2013 the documents that are remote from the centroid may be on rare subjects and be distant from the other documents in the cluster. That is, they may dilute the topical integrity that might be observed closer to the cluster\u2019s centre. However, we thought this a useful alternative to explore.\nStraightforwardly, we determine the vector for a cluster as the average of all the vectors in the cluster \u2013 that is, we use the centroid.

Clustering has a long history in IR, and up to the 1980s was regarded as a plausible search mechanism, under which, it was supposed, users would iteratively navigate to ever smaller clusters rather than issue a query [14, 30]. While such approaches did not continue to be explored, as collections grew in size and index-based search technology matured, there has been ongoing interest in clustering in its own right and as a support for a range of search-related tasks [2, 13, 15\u201317].\nA range of mechanisms have been proposed for clustering. One approach is bottom-up methods, in particular agglomerative or hierarchical clustering [10, 11, 14, 34]. The other is top-down methods, in particular K-means [4, 8, 23]. In practice, agglomerative methods have not been found to scale to realistic collection sizes, and reported experiments on large collections all seem to use K-means. We therefore use we use K-means for the work in this paper. Although the robustness of K-means has been questioned, for example with regard to stability and the potential to fall into local minima rather than produce globally optimal outcomes, in a separate project (manuscript in submission) we have observed reasonably stable performance. In brief, in K-means clustering an expected number of clusters, k, is chosen. Initially k documents are chosen as seeds, and each document in the collection is allocated to the cluster for which the seed is the nearest neighbour. At each subsequent iteration, the centroid of each cluster is computed; this is the average of the allocated documents. The documents are then allocated again to the cluster with the nearest centroid. This repeats until an iteration limit is reached or the process converges, that is, the clusters are unchanged between iterations. The value of k can be optimised by exploring behaviour as k is varied, for example with the Elbow method [27], but in this work we use fixed k based on results in the separate project mentioned above.\nThe concept of \u2018nearest neighbour\u2019 requires a document representation. In the results reported here, we use a TFIDF calculation of word weights so that documents are represented as a vector whose dimensionality is |V|. A straightforward Cosine formulation is used to determine similarity.\nTo describe clusters we need to label them [24]. Three elementary methods are high-weight terms in the centroids, mutual information (the terms that best discriminate from other clusters), and information drawn from document titles. A wide range of other methods have been described, including use of WordNet [26], choice of terms from concept graphs for clusters [1, 5, 12], and use of neural networks [20]. Here, we only consider simple methods.\nTopic modelling. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic Bayesian approach to topic modelling proposed by Blei et al. [3]. In contrast to K-means clustering, documents are assumed to be comprised of multiple topics. Intuitively, topics are distinguished by the different degrees to which they are associated with words in the vocabulary; a word that is prominent in one topic may be insignificant in another. The approach assumes that a collection covers a known number m of topics and that each document is a blend of a subset of these topics. It also assumes that there is an underlying data generation process in which, first, the topics of a document follows a multinomial distribution, controlled by a common Dirichlet prior for the collection; and second, for each of the topics, the words are generated from another multinomial distribution, controlled by a Dirchlet prior that is shared among topics. The two distributions are assumed to be independent."], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": ["Document collections can be characterised in a variety of ways.

The other is topic modelling, in which each topic is a mapping from the set of terms (words) in the collections to a set of weights; the highly weighted words for a topic are anticipated to represent a semantic theme.\n\nSecond, on this collection, and subsets of it, we show that there is significant alignment between cluster membership and the major topic labels of documents. We regard this is as a highly surprising result, as the methods of creating these representations is very different. As we show, the alignment can be observed in two different ways: through the dominance of specific topics within individual clusters, and through inspection of the significant words in clusters and topics.\n\nThird, we use the topic\u2013cluster alignment to demonstrate that, in this case study at least, the words in documents that are close to the centroids of clusters are a poor representative of the cluster as a whole.

The entries in the vector correspond to terms in the vocabulary. Binary vectors have a value of 1 if the term is present within a particular document and 0 if it is absent.

Another perspective on this observation is that clustering can create subcategories of documents that share a dominant topic, while topic modelling supplements clustering by identifying subtopics.\nSome clusters are a mix of topics, with no one topic well represented, and large clusters are less likely to have a strongly dominant topic than are small clusters. As noted above, this suggests that topic modelling can be used to test the cohesion of a cluster.\nThe \u2018central keywords\u2019 method for generating textual descriptions was not successful. In our view the likely explanation is that it is based on a false assumption, namely that clusters resemble a dot-cloud. The structure of high-dimensional spaces can be counter-intuitive [32];"], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": ["One of these is clustering, in which the collection is partitioned into subcollections with the goal of the subcollections being distinct from each other and more narrowly themed than is the collection as a whole. The other is topic modelling, in which each topic is a mapping from the set of terms (words) in the collections to a set of weights; the highly weighted words for a topic are anticipated to represent a semantic theme. We show that the alignment can be observed in two different ways: through the dominance of specific topics within individual clusters, and through inspection of the significant words in clusters and topics. That is, in a complementary way we have compared clustering to topic modelling by mapping them in both directions. Third, we use the topic\u2013cluster alignment to demonstrate that, in this case study at least, the words in documents that are close to the centroids of clusters are a poor representative of the cluster as a whole. The results of our case study show that the clustering and topic-modelling methods can be mutually confirming and appear to be generating semantically meaningful representations, while also suggesting that there are limits to the assertions that can be made about how distinct different topics, and different clusters, are from each other."], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": ["In our research clusters are represented with keywords and are determined independently of consideration of topic models.\n\nThe intuition the dot-cloud metaphor suggests is that there are some archetypal items (documents in this study) at the centre of each cluster that can stand as ideotypes for the whole. In the first of our two approaches to generating representative word lists, we assume that the documents that are closest to the centroid are a good proxy for the whole, so that word lists generated from those documents will be informative about the cluster.\n\nIn detail, the Cosine distance between each document in the cluster and the centroid is calculated. We select the top 10 documents closest to the centroid and pool them, and select the top (highest-weighted) N words as the representative keywords.\n\nKeywords by all documents of a cluster (cluster keywords). An alternative to using the documents that are close to the centre is to use them all. Intuitively, this is an appealing approach if the documents are reasonably homogeneous but \u2013 considering the dot-cloud metaphor again \u2013 the documents that are remote from the centroid may be on rare subjects and be distant from the other documents in the cluster. That is, they may dilute the topical integrity that might be observed closer to the cluster\u2019s centre. However, we thought this a useful alternative to explore.\n\nStraightforwardly, we determine the vector for a cluster as the average of all the vectors in the cluster \u2013 that is, we use the centroid.

Clustering has a long history in IR, and up to the 1980s was regarded as a plausible search mechanism, under which, it was supposed, users would iteratively navigate to ever smaller clusters rather than issue a query [14, 30]. While such approaches did not continue to be explored, as collections grew in size and index-based search technology matured, there has been ongoing interest in clustering in its own right and as a support for a range of search-related tasks [2, 13, 15\u201317].\nA range of mechanisms have been proposed for clustering. One approach is bottom-up methods, in particular agglomerative or hierarchical clustering [10, 11, 14, 34]. The other is top-down methods, in particular K-means [4, 8, 23]. In practice, agglomerative methods have not been found to scale to realistic collection sizes, and reported experiments on large collections all seem to use K-means.\nWe therefore use we use K-means for the work in this paper. Although the robustness ofK-means has been questioned, for example with regard to stability and the potential to fall into local minima rather than produce globally optimal outcomes, in a separate project (manuscript in submission) we have observed reasonably stable performance. In brief, inK-means clustering an expected number of clusters, k, is chosen. Initiallyk documents are chosen as seeds, and each document in the collection is allocated to the cluster for which the seed is the nearest neighbour. At each subsequent iteration, the centroid of each cluster is computed; this is the average of the allocated documents. The documents are then allocated again to the cluster with the nearest centroid. This repeats until an iteration limit is reached or the process converges, that is, the clusters are unchanged between iterations. The value of k can be optimised by exploring behaviour as k is varied, for example with the Elbow method [27], but in this work we use fixedk based on results in the separate project mentioned above.\nThe concept of \u2018nearest neighbour\u2019 requires a document repre- sentation. In the results reported here, we use a TFIDF calculation of word weights so that documents are represented as a vector whose dimensionality is |V |. A straightforward Cosine formulation is used to determine similarity.\nTo describe clusters we need to label them [24]. Three elementary methods are high-weight terms in the centroids, mutual informa- tion (the terms that best discriminate from other clusters), and information drawn from document titles. A wide range of other methods have been described, including use of WordNet [26], choice of terms from concept graphs for clusters [1, 5, 12], and use of neural networks [20]. Here, we only consider simple methods.\nTopic modelling. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a probabilis- tic Bayesian approach to topic modelling proposed by Blei et al. [3]. In contrast to K-means clustering, documents are assumed to be comprised of multiple topics. Intuitively, topics are distinguished by the different degrees to which they are associated with words in the vocabulary; a word that is prominent in one topic may be insignificant in another. The approach assumes that a collection covers a known number m of topics and that each document is a blend of a subset of these topics. It also assumes that there is an underlying data generation process in which, first, the topics of a document follows a multinomial distribution, controlled by a common Dirichlet prior for the collection; and second, for each of the topics, the words are generated from another multinomial distribution, controlled by a Dirchlet prior that is shared among topics. The two distributions are assumed to be independent.\nLDA learns the distributions governing this generative process for a given corpus as follows. Initially there is a random assignment of topics to each document and of"], "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": ["Two key approaches are clustering, which partitions collections\ninto subcollections with the expectation that the contents will be\nthematically linked, and topic models, which describe the contents\nin terms of weighted lists of words that are expected to represent dif-\nferent themes."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-21922177": 1, "wikipedia-253434": 1, "wikipedia-57216564": 1, "wikipedia-40435919": 1, "wikipedia-144948": 1, "wikipedia-18421474": 1, "wikipedia-2233140": 1, "wikipedia-45958": 1, "wikipedia-29347958": 1, "wikipedia-47786948": 1, "arxiv-2502.02086": 1, "arxiv-2203.02368": 1, "arxiv-1905.05985": 1, "arxiv-2411.10488": 1, "arxiv-2011.08538": 1, "arxiv-2407.21131": 1, "arxiv-2204.02860": 1, "arxiv-2211.06495": 1, "arxiv-2103.13775": 1, "arxiv-2408.00399": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/6": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": 2, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-21922177": 1, "wikipedia-253434": 1, "wikipedia-57216564": 1, "wikipedia-40435919": 1, "wikipedia-144948": 1, "wikipedia-18421474": 1, "wikipedia-2233140": 1, "wikipedia-45958": 1, "wikipedia-29347958": 1, "wikipedia-47786948": 1, "arxiv-2502.02086": 1, "arxiv-2203.02368": 1, "arxiv-1905.05985": 1, "arxiv-2411.10488": 1, "arxiv-2011.08538": 1, "arxiv-2407.21131": 1, "arxiv-2204.02860": 1, "arxiv-2211.06495": 1, "arxiv-2103.13775": 1, "arxiv-2408.00399": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/6": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/2": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/3": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/0": 3, "paper/29/3503516.3503527.jsonl/5": 2}}}

There are three main contributions in this work. First, we compare two simple cluster labelling methods, which are intended to create compact thematic representations of their contents. Second, on this collection, and subsets of it, we show that there is significant alignment between cluster membership and the major topic labels of documents. We regard this is as a highly surprising result, as the methods of creating these representations is very different. As we show, the alignment can be observed in two different ways: through the dominance of specific topics within individual clusters, and through inspection of the significant words in clusters and topics. That is, in a complementary way we have compared clustering to topic modelling by mapping them in both directions. Third, we use the topic\u2013cluster alignment to demonstrate that, in this case study at least, the words in documents that are close to the centroids of clusters are a poor representative of the cluster as a whole. We hypothesise that this arises because even the nearest document to a centroid may be relatively distant, and may be close to the centroid on dimensions that are untypical of the cluster as a whole; this kind of counter-intuitive behaviour easily arises in high-dimensional data. The results of our case study show that the clustering and topic-modelling methods can be mutually confirming and appear to be generating semantically meaningful representations, while also suggesting that there are limits to the assertions that can be made about how distinct different topics, and different clusters, are from each other. We believe that these results establish the need for a more systematic investigation of the topic\u2013cluster relationship and that, if confirmed, it can provide the basis of rich mechanisms for exploration of document collections."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Within the clinic, a broad group of participants - including those who are exceptionally health, at-risk of disease, and with overt disease - will be providing deep data on a diverse set of measurements with repeat sampling over the course of four years. To bridge these encounters, Verily has developed tools such as the investigational Study Watch to allow participants to provide insights throughout their everyday lives.\nThat means the Project Baseline study dataset will include clinical, molecular, imaging, self-reported, behavioral, environmental, sensor and other health-related measurements. To organize this information, Verily is developing infrastructure that can process multi-dimensional health data - much of which have never been combined for an individual. \nThe project also hopes to enable doctors to predict the onset of diseases such as cancer and heart disease far earlier than is currently possible.

Second, on this collection, and subsets of it, we show that there is significant alignment between cluster membership and the major topic labels of documents. We regard this is as a highly surprising result, as the methods of creating these representations is very different. As we show, the alignment can be observed in two different ways: through the dominance of specific topics within individual clusters, and through inspection of the significant words in clusters and topics. That is, in a complementary way we have compared clustering to topic modelling by mapping them in both directions.\nThird, we use the topic\u2013cluster alignment to demonstrate that,\nin this case study at least, the words in documents that are close to\nthe centroids of clusters are a poor representative of the cluster as\na whole.
