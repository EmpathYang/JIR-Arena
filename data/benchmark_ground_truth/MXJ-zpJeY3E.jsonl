Thus he sought a position in astronomy, and in 1807 was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Director of the astronomical observatory in G\u00f6ttingen, a post he held for the remainder of his life.\nThe discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually published in 1809 as \"Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum\" (Theory of motion of the celestial bodies moving in conic sections around the Sun). In the process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th-century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation. It introduced the Gaussian gravitational constant, and contained an influential treatment of the method of least squares, a procedure used in all sciences to this day to minimize the impact of measurement error.\nThere are several stories of his early genius. According to one, his gifts became very apparent at the age of three when he corrected, mentally and without fault in his calculations, an error his father had made on paper while calculating finances.\nAnother story has it that in primary school after the young Gauss misbehaved, his teacher, J.G. B\u00fcttner, gave him a task: add a list of integers in arithmetic progression; as the story is most often told, these were the numbers from 1 to 100. The young Gauss reputedly produced the correct answer within seconds, to the astonishment of his teacher and his assistant Martin Bartels.\nHe referred to mathematics as \"the queen of sciences\" and supposedly once espoused a belief in the necessity of immediately understanding Euler's identity as a benchmark pursuant to becoming a first-class mathematician."], "wikipedia-102567": ["Nash's later work involved ventures in advanced game theory, including partial agency, which show that, as in his early career, he preferred to select his own path and problems."], "wikipedia-2337582": ["Hua did not receive a formal university education.

By the time Hua returned to Jintan, he was already engaged in independent mathematics research, and his first publication \"Some Researches on the Theorem of Sturm\", appeared in the December 1929 issue of the Shanghai periodical \"Science\". In the following year Hua showed in a short note in the same journal that a certain 1926 paper claiming to have solved the quintic was fundamentally flawed.

During his eight years there, Hua studied Vinogradov's seminal method of estimating trigonometric sums and reformulated it in sharper form, in what is now known universally as Vinogradov's mean value theorem. This famous result is central to improved versions of the Hilbert\u2013Waring theorem, and has important applications to the study of the Riemann zeta function.\n\nBack in China, Hua threw himself into educational reform and the organization of mathematical activity at the graduate level, in the schools, and among workers in the burgeoning industry. In July 1952 the Mathematical Institute of the Academia Sinica came into being, with Hua as its first director.\n\nDespite his many teaching and administrative duties, Hua remained active in research and continued to write, not only on topics that had engaged him before but also in areas that were new to him or had been only lightly touched on before.\n\nThe newfound interest in applicable mathematics took him in the 1960s, accompanied by a team of assistants, all over China to show workers of all kinds how to apply their reasoning faculty to the solution of shop-floor and everyday problems.

In his memorial on Gauss, Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen says that when Gauss was barely three years old he corrected a math error his father made; and that when he was seven, he confidently solved an arithmetic series problem faster than anyone else in his class of 100 students. Many versions of this story have been retold since that time with various details regarding what the series was \u2013 the most frequent being the classical problem of adding all the integers from 1 to 100. There are many other anecdotes about his precocity while a toddler, and he made his first groundbreaking mathematical discoveries while still a teenager. He completed his magnum opus, \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\", in 1798, at the age of 21\u2014though it was not published until 1801. This work was fundamental in consolidating number theory as a discipline and has shaped the field to the present day.\n\nWhile at university, Gauss independently rediscovered several important theorems. His breakthrough occurred in 1796 when he showed that a regular polygon can be constructed by compass and straightedge if the number of its sides is the product of distinct Fermat primes and a power of 2. This was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians since the days of the Ancient Greeks, and the discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of philology as a career.\n\nThe year 1796 was productive for both Gauss and number theory. He discovered a construction of the heptadecagon on 30 March. He further advanced modular arithmetic, greatly simplifying manipulations in number theory. On 8 April he became the first to prove the quadratic reciprocity law. This remarkably general law allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic. The prime number theorem, conjectured on 31 May, gives a good understanding of how the prime numbers are distributed among the integers.\n\nGauss also discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of at most three triangular numbers on 10 July and then jotted down in his diary the note: \"\u0395\u03a5\u03a1\u0397\u039a\u0391! . On 1 October he published a result on the number of solutions of polynomials with coefficients in finite fields, which 150 years later led to the Weil conjectures.", "The discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually published in 1809 as \"Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum\" (Theory of motion of the celestial bodies moving in conic sections around the Sun). In the process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th-century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation. It introduced the Gaussian gravitational constant, and contained an influential treatment of the method of least squares, a procedure used in all sciences to this day to minimize the impact of measurement error.\n\nGauss proved the method under the assumption of normally distributed errors (see Gauss\u2013Markov theorem; see also Gaussian). The method had been described earlier by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805, but Gauss claimed that he had been using it since 1794 or 1795. In the history of statistics, this disagreement is called the \"priority dispute over the discovery of the method of least squares.\"\n\nIn 1818 Gauss, putting his calculation skills to practical use, carried out a geodetic survey of the Kingdom of Hanover, linking up with previous Danish surveys. To aid the survey, Gauss invented the heliotrope, an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight over great distances, to measure positions.\n\nGauss also claimed to have discovered the possibility of non-Euclidean geometries but never published it. This discovery was a major paradigm shift in mathematics, as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclid's axioms were the only way to make geometry consistent and non-contradictory.\n\nResearch on these geometries led to, among other things, Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the universe as non-Euclidean. His friend Farkas Wolfgang Bolyai with whom Gauss had sworn \"brotherhood and the banner of truth\" as a student, had tried in vain for many years to prove the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms of geometry.\n\nBolyai's son, J\u00e1nos Bolyai, discovered non-Euclidean geometry in 1829; his work was published in 1832. After seeing it, Gauss wrote to Farkas Bolyai: \"To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work\u00a0... coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years.\"\n\nThis unproved statement put a strain on his relationship with Bolyai who thought that Gauss was \"stealing\" his idea.\n\nLetters from Gauss years before 1829 reveal him obscurely discussing the problem of parallel lines. Waldo Dunnington, a biographer of Gauss, argues in \"Gauss, Titan of Science\" that Gauss was in fact in full possession of non-Euclidean geometry long before it was published by Bolyai, but that he refused to publish any of it because of his fear of controversy.\n\nThe geodetic survey of Hanover, which required Gauss to spend summers traveling on horseback for a decade, fueled Gauss's interest in differential geometry and topology, fields of mathematics dealing with curves and surfaces. Among other things, he came up with the notion of Gaussian curvature.\n\nThis led in 1828 to an important theorem, the Theorema Egregium (\"remarkable theorem\"), establishing an important property of the notion of curvature. Informally, the theorem says that the curvature of a surface can be determined entirely by measuring angles and distances on the surface.\n\nThat is, curvature does not depend on how the surface might be embedded in 3-dimensional space or 2-dimensional space.\n\nIn 1831, Gauss developed a fruitful collaboration with the physics professor Wilhelm Weber, leading to new knowledge in magnetism (including finding a representation for the unit of magnetism in terms of mass, charge, and time) and the discovery of Kirchhoff's circuit laws in electricity. It was during this time that he formulated his namesake law. They constructed the first electromechanical telegraph in 1833, which connected the observatory with the institute for physics in G\u00f6ttingen. Gauss ordered a magnetic observatory to be built in the garden of the observatory, and with Weber founded the \"Magnetischer Verein\" (\"magnetic association\"), which supported measurements of Earth's magnetic field in many regions of the world. He developed a method of measuring the horizontal intensity of the magnetic field which was in use well into the second half of the 20th century, and worked out the mathematical theory for separating the inner and outer (magnetospheric) sources of Earth's magnetic field."], "wikipedia-102567": ["Nash's later work involved ventures in advanced game theory, including partial agency, which show that, as in his early career, he preferred to select his own path and problems.

Hua met a capable math teacher in middle school who recognized his talent early and encouraged him to read advanced texts. After middle school, Hua enrolled in Chinese Vocational College in Shanghai, and there he distinguished himself by winning a national abacus competition. Although tuition fees at the college were low, living costs proved too high for his means, and Hua was forced to leave a term before graduating. After failing to find a job in Shanghai, Hua returned home in 1927 to help in his father's store. In 1929, Hua contracted typhoid fever and was in bed for half a year. The culmination of Hua's illness resulted in the partial paralysis of his left leg, which impeded his movement quite severely for the rest of his life.\nAfter middle school, Hua continued to study mathematics independently with the few books he had, and studied the entire high school and early undergraduate math curriculum.

Wiener visited England soon afterward and spoke of Hua to G. H. Hardy. In this way Hua received an invitation to come to Cambridge, England, where he stayed for two years.\nWhile at Cambridge University, Hua worked on applying the Hardy\u2013Littlewood circle method towards problems in number theory.

During his eight years there, Hua studied Vinogradov's seminal method of estimating trigonometric sums and reformulated it in sharper form, in what is now known universally as Vinogradov's mean value theorem. This famous result is central to improved versions of the Hilbert\u2013Waring theorem, and has important applications to the study of the Riemann zeta function. Hua wrote up this work in a booklet titled \"Additive Theory of Prime Numbers\" that was accepted for publication in Russia as early as 1940, but owing to the war, did not appear in expanded form until 1947 as a monograph of the Steklov Institute. In the closing years of the Kunming period, Hua turned his interests to algebra and analysis towards which he soon began to make original contributions.\nAfter the war, Hua spent three months in the Soviet Union in the spring of 1946, at Ivan Vinogradov's invitation, following which Hua departed for Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton University. At Princeton, Hua worked on matrix theory, functions of several complex variables, and group theory. At this time civil war was raging in China and it was not easy to travel, and for \"convenience of travel,\" the Chinese authorities had assigned Hua the rank of general in his passport.\nIn the spring of 1948, Hua accepted appointment as full professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. However, his stay in Illinois was far too brief. In October 1949, the People's Republic of China was established, and Hua, wanting to be part of a new epoch, decided to return to China with his wife and kids, despite having settled comfortably in the United States.\nBack in China, Hua threw himself into educational reform and the organization of mathematical activity at the graduate level, in the schools, and among workers in the burgeoning industry. In July 1952 the Mathematical Institute of the Academia Sinica came into being, with Hua as its first director. The following year he was one of a 26-member delegation from the Academia Sinica to visit the Soviet Union in order to establish links with Russian science. Later, he was the first Chair of the Department of Mathematics and Vice President of University of Science & Technology of China (USTC), a new type of Chinese university established by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 1958, which was aimed at fostering skilled researchers necessary for the economic development, defense and education in science and technology. \nDespite his many teaching and administrative duties, Hua remained active in research and continued to write, not only on topics that had engaged him before but also in areas that were new to him or had been only lightly touched on before. In 1956, his voluminous text, \"Introduction to Number Theory\", appeared, and later it was published in English by Springer. \"Harmonic Analysis of Functions of Several Complex Variables in the Classical Domains\" came out in 1958 and was translated into Russian in the same year, followed by an English translation by the American Mathematical Society in 1963.\nOutside of pure math, Hua first proposed in 1952 the development of China's electronic computer, and in early 1953, an initial research team for this project was formed under Hua's leadership by the Mathematical Institute of the Academia Sinica.\nThe start of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 came with a vehement attack on pure mathematics and intellectuals, which prompted Hua to shift towards applied mathematics. Hua developed, with Wang Yuan, a broad interest in linear programming, operations research, and multidimensional numerical integration. In connection with the last of these, the study of the Monte Carlo method and the role of uniform distribution led them to invent an alternative deterministic method based on ideas from algebraic number theory. Their theory was set out in \"Applications of Number Theory to Numerical Analysis\", which was published much later, in 1978, and by Springer in English translation in 1981. The newfound interest in applicable mathematics took him in the 1960s, accompanied by a team of assistants, all over China to show workers of all kinds how to apply their reasoning faculty to the solution of shop-floor and everyday problems. Whether in ad hoc problem-solving sessions in factories or open-air teachings, he touched his audiences with the spirit of mathematics to such an extent that he became a national hero and even earned an unsolicited letter of commendation from Mao Zedong, this last a valuable protection in uncertain times. Hua had a commanding presence, a genial personality, and a wonderful way of putting things simply, and the impact of his travels spread his fame and the popularity of mathematics across the land.\nFollowing the Cultural Revolution, Hua resumed contact with Western mathematicians. In 1980 Hua became a cultural ambassador of China charged with re-establishing links with Western academics, and during the next five years he travelled extensively in Europe, the United States, and Japan. In 1979 he was a visiting research fellow of the then Science Research Council of the United Kingdom at the University of Birmingham and during 1983\u201384 he was Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at the California Institute of Technology. He died of a heart attack at the end of a lecture he gave in Tokyo on 12 June 1985."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-18902": 1, "wikipedia-61347231": 1, "wikipedia-60443147": 1, "wikipedia-1158496": 1, "wikipedia-18831": 1, "wikipedia-6125": 2, "wikipedia-102567": 2, "wikipedia-9397829": 1, "wikipedia-2337582": 2, "wikipedia-1524543": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-18902": 1, "wikipedia-61347231": 1, "wikipedia-60443147": 1, "wikipedia-1158496": 1, "wikipedia-18831": 1, "wikipedia-6125": 3, "wikipedia-102567": 3, "wikipedia-9397829": 1, "wikipedia-2337582": 3, "wikipedia-1524543": 1}}}

It can also be used to denote abstract vectors and linear functionals in mathematics. The notation uses angle brackets (the \u27e8 and \u27e9 symbols) and a vertical bar (the | symbol), to denote the scalar product of vectors or the action of a linear functional on a vector in a complex vector space.\nThe scalar product or action is written as\nThe right part is called the ket ; it is a vector, typically represented as a column vector, and written formula_2\nThe left part is called the bra, ; it is the Hermitian conjugate of the ket with the same label, typically represented as a row vector, and written formula_3\nA combination of bras, kets, and operators is interpreted using matrix multiplication. A bra and a ket with the same label are Hermitian conjugates of each other.\nBra-ket notation was introduced in 1939 by Paul Dirac and is also known as the Dirac notation. However the bra-ket notation has a precursor in Hermann Grassmann's use of the notation formula_4 for his inner products nearly 100 years earlier.\nSection::::Introduction.\nBra\u2013ket notation is a notation for linear algebra, particularly focused on vectors, inner products, linear operators, Hermitian conjugation, and the dual space, for both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional complex vector spaces. It is specifically designed to ease the types of calculations that frequently come up in quantum mechanics.\nIts use in quantum mechanics is quite widespread. Many phenomena that are explained using quantum mechanics are usually explained using bra\u2013ket notation.\nIn simple cases, a ket can be described as a column vector, a bra with the same label is its conjugate transpose (which is a row vector), and writing bras, kets, and linear operators next to each other implies matrix multiplication. However, kets may also exist in uncountably-infinite-dimensional vector spaces, such that they cannot be literally written as a column vector. Also, writing a column vector as a list of numbers requires picking a basis, whereas one can write \"\" without committing to any particular basis. This is helpful because quantum mechanics calculations involve frequently switching between different bases (e.g. position basis, momentum basis, energy eigenbasis, etc.), so it is better to have the basis vectors (if any) written out explicitly. In some situations involving two important basis vectors they will be referred to simply as \"\" and \"\".\nThe standard mathematical notation for the inner product, preferred as well by some physicists, expresses exactly the same thing as the bra\u2013ket notation,\nBras and kets can also be configured in other ways, such as the outer product\nwhich can also be represented as a matrix multiplication (i.e., a column vector times a row vector equals a matrix).\nIf the ket is an element of a vector space, the bra is technically an element of its dual space\u2014see Riesz representation theorem.\nSection::::Vector spaces.\nSection::::Vector spaces.:Vectors vs kets.\nIn mathematics, the term \"vector\" is used to refer generally to any element of any vector space. In physics, however, the term \"vector\" is much more specific: \"Vector\" refers almost exclusively to quantities like displacement or velocity, which have three components that relate directly to the three dimensions of the real world. Such vectors are typically denoted with over arrows () or boldface ().\nIn quantum mechanics, a quantum state is typically represented as an element of an abstract complex vector space\u2014for example the infinite-dimensional vector space of all possible wavefunctions (functions mapping each point of 3D space to a complex number). Since the term \"vector\" is already used for something else (see previous paragraph), it is very common to refer to these elements of abstract complex vector spaces as \"kets\", and to write them using ket notation.\nSection::::Vector spaces.:Ket notation.\nKet notation, invented by Dirac, uses vertical bars and angular brackets: . When this notation is used, these quantities are called \"kets\", and is read as \"ket-A\". These kets can be manipulated using the usual rules of linear algebra, for example:\nNote how any symbols, letters, numbers, or even words\u2014whatever serves as a convenient label\u2014can be used as the label inside a ket. For example, the last line above involves infinitely many different kets, one for each real number . In other words, the symbol \"\" has a specific and universal mathematical meaning, while just the \"\" by itself does not. For example, might or might not be equal to . Nevertheless, for convenience, there is usually some logical scheme behind the labels inside kets, such as the common practice of labeling energy eigenkets in quantum mechanics through a listing of their quantum numbers.\nSection::::Vector spaces.:Inner products and bras.\nAn inner product is a generalization of the dot product. The inner product of two vectors is a scalar. In neutral notation (notation dedicated to the inner product \"only\"), this might be written , where and are elements of the abstract vector space, i.e. both are \"kets\".\nBra\u2013ket notation uses a specific notation for inner products:\nBra\u2013ket notation splits this inner product (also called a \"bracket\") into two pieces, the \"bra\" and the \"ket\":\nwhere is called a bra, read as \"bra-A\", and is a ket as above.\nThe purpose of \"splitting\" the inner product into a bra and a ket is that \"both\" the bra and the ket are meaningful \"on their own\", and can be used in other contexts besides within an inner product. There are two main ways to think about the meanings of separate bras and kets. Accordingly, the interpretation of the expression has a second interpretation, namely that of the action of a linear functional per below.\nSection::::Vector spaces.:Inner products and bras.:Bras and kets as row and column vectors.\nFor a finite-dimensional vector space, using a fixed orthonormal basis, the inner product can be written as a matrix multiplication of a row vector with a column vector:\nBased on this, the bras and kets can be defined as:\nand then it is understood that a bra next to a ket implies matrix multiplication.\nThe conjugate transpose (also called \"Hermitian conjugate\") of a bra is the corresponding ket and vice versa:\nbecause if one starts with the bra\nthen performs a complex conjugation, and then a matrix transpose, one ends up with the ket\nSection::::Vector spaces.:Inner products and bras.:Bras as linear functionals.\nA more abstract definition, which is equivalent but more easily generalized to infinite-dimensional spaces, is to say that bras are linear functionals on the space of kets, i.e. linear transformations that input a ket and output a complex number. The bra linear functionals are defined to be consistent with the inner product. Thus, if is the linear functional corresponding to under the Riesz representation theorem, then\ni.e. it produces \"the same\" complex number as the inner product does. The terminology for the right hand side is though \"not\" inner product, which always involves two \"kets\". While confusing this is harmless, since the same number is produced in the end.\nIn mathematics terminology, the vector space of bras is the dual space to the vector space of kets, and corresponding bras and kets are related by the Riesz representation theorem.\nSection::::Vector spaces.:Non-normalizable states and non-Hilbert spaces.\nBra\u2013ket notation can be used even if the vector space is not a Hilbert space.\nIn quantum mechanics, it is common practice to write down kets which have infinite norm, i.e. non-normalizable wavefunctions. Examples include states whose wavefunctions are Dirac delta functions or infinite plane waves. These do not, technically, belong to the Hilbert space itself. However, the definition of \"Hilbert space\" can be broadened to accommodate these states (see the Gelfand\u2013Naimark\u2013Segal construction or rigged Hilbert spaces). The bra\u2013ket notation continues to work in an analogous way in this broader context.\nBanach spaces are a different generalization of Hilbert spaces. In a Banach space , the vectors may be notated by kets and the continuous linear functionals by bras. Over any vector space without topology, we may also notate the vectors by kets and the linear functionals by bras. In these more general contexts, the bracket does not have the meaning of an inner product, because the Riesz representation theorem does not apply.\nSection::::Usage in quantum mechanics.\nThe mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is based in large part on linear algebra:\nBULLET::::- Wave functions and other quantum states can be represented as vectors in a complex Hilbert space. (The exact structure of this Hilbert space depends on the situation.) In bra\u2013ket notation, for example, an electron might be in the \"state\" . (Technically, the quantum states are \"rays\" of vectors in the Hilbert space, as corresponds to the same state for any nonzero complex number .)\nBULLET::::- Quantum superpositions can be described as vector sums of the constituent states. For example, an electron in the state is in a quantum superposition of the states and .\nBULLET::::- Measurements are associated with linear operators (called observables) on the Hilbert space of quantum states.\nBULLET::::- Dynamics are also described by linear operators on the Hilbert space.

However, strictly speaking, this is not true, in that multiplication by certain expressions may introduce new solutions that were not present before. For example, consider the following equation:\nIf we multiply both sides by zero, we get\nThis is true for all values of \"x\", so the solution set is all real numbers. But clearly not all real numbers are solutions to the original equation. The problem is that multiplication by zero is not \"invertible\": if we multiply by any nonzero value, we can reverse the step by dividing by the same value, but division by zero is not defined, so multiplication by zero cannot be reversed.\nMore subtly, suppose we take the same equation and multiply both sides by \"x\". We get\nThis quadratic equation has two solutions, \u2212 2 and 0. But if zero is substituted for \"x\" into the original equation, the result is the invalid equation 2\u00a0=\u00a00. This counterintuitive result occurs because in the case where \"x\"=0, multiplying both sides by \"x\" multiplies both sides by zero, and so necessarily produces a true equation just as in the first example.\nIn general, whenever we multiply both sides of an equation by an expression involving variables, we introduce extraneous solutions wherever that expression is equal to zero. But it is not sufficient to exclude these values, because they may have been legitimate solutions to the original equation. For example, suppose we multiply both sides of our original equation \"x\"\u00a0+\u00a02\u00a0=\u00a00 by \"x\"\u00a0+\u00a02. We get\nwhich has only one real solution: x\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122, and this is a solution to the original equation, so it cannot be excluded, even though \"x\"\u00a0+\u00a02 is zero for this value of \"x\"."], "wikipedia-52728349": ["The quantum least-squares fitting algorithm makes use of a version of Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd's quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations (HHL), and outputs the coefficients formula_13 and the fit quality estimation formula_14.

For example:\nA system with five equations and five unknowns is a very specific situation : our example was designed to end up with this specificity. In general, the numbers of data and unknowns are different so that matrix formula_1 is not square.\nHowever, even a square matrix can have no inverse : matrix formula_1 can be rank deficient (i.e. has zero eigenvalues) and the solution of the system formula_48 is not unique. Then the solution of the inverse problem will be undetermined. This is a first difficulty. Over-determined systems (more equations than unknowns) have other issues.\nAlso noise may corrupt our observations making formula_32 possibly outside the space formula_21 of possible responses to model parameters so that solution of the system formula_48 may not exist. This is another difficulty.\nSection::::Linear inverse problems.:An elementary example : Earth's gravitational field.:Tools to overcome the first difficulty.\nThe first difficulty reflects a crucial problem : our observations do not contain enough information and additional data are required. Additional data can come from physical prior information on the parameter values, on their spatial distribution or, more generally, on their mutual dependence, ... It can also come from other experiments : for instance we may think of integrating data recorded by gravimeters and seismographs for a better estimation of densities. \nIntegration of this additional information is basically a problem of statistics. This discipline is the one that can answer the question : how to mix quantities of different nature ? We will be more precise in the section \"Bayesian approach\" below.\nConcerning distributed parameters, prior information about their spatial distribution often consists in information about some derivatives of these distributed parameters. Also, it is common practice, although somewhat artificial, to look for the \"simplest\" model that reasonably matches the data. This is usually achieved by penalizing the formula_55 norm of the gradient (or the total variation) of the parameters (this approach is also referred to as the maximization of the entropy). One can also make the model simple through a parametrization that introduces freedom degrees only when necessary.\nAdditional information may also be integrated through inequality constraints on the model parameters or some functions of them. Such constraints are important to avoid unrealistic values for the parameters (negative values for instance). In this case the space spanned by model parameters will no longer be a vector space but a subset of admissible models denoted by formula_56 in the sequel.\nSection::::Linear inverse problems.:An elementary example : Earth's gravitational field.:Tools to overcome the second difficulty.\nAs mentioned above, noise may be such that our measurements are not the image of any model, so that we cannot look for a model that produces the data but rather look for the best (or optimal) model: that is, the one that best matches the data. This leads us to minimize an objective function, namely a functional that quantifies how big the residuals are or how far the predicted data are from the observed data. Of course, when we have perfect data (i.e. no noise) then the recovered model should fit the observed data perfectly. A standard objective function, formula_57, is of the form:\nwhere formula_59 is the Euclidean norm (it will be the formula_60 norm when the measurements are functions instead of samples) of the residuals. This approach amounts to making use of ordinary least squares, an approach widely used in statistics. However, the Euclidean norm is known to be very sensitive to outliers : to avoid this difficulty we may think of using other distances, for instance the formula_55 norm, in replacement of the formula_60 norm.\nSection::::Linear inverse problems.:An elementary example : Earth's gravitational field.:Bayesian approach.\nVery similar to the least-squares approach, is the probabilistic approach : if we know the statistics of the noise that contaminates the data, we can think of seeking the most likely model m, that is the model that matches the maximum likelihood criterion. If the noise is Gaussian, the maximum likelihood criterion appears as a least-squares criterion, the Euclidean scalar product in data space being replaced by a scalar product involving the co-variance of the noise. Also, should prior information on model parameters be available, we could think of using Bayesian inference to formulate the solution of the inverse problem. This approach is described in detail in Tarantola's book.\nSection::::Linear inverse problems.:An elementary example : Earth's gravitational field.:Numerical solution of our elementary example.\nHere we make use of the Euclidean norm to quantify the data misfits. As we deal with a linear inverse problem, the objective function is quadratic. For its minimization, it is classical to compute its gradient using the same rationale (as we would to minimize a function of only one variable). At the optimal model formula_63, this gradient vanishes which can be written as :\nwhere \"F\" denotes the matrix transpose of \"F\". This equation simplifies to:\nThis expression is known as the normal equation and gives us a possible solution to the inverse problem. \nIn our example matrix formula_66 turns out to be generally full rank so that the equation above makes sense and determines uniquely the model parameters : we do not need integrating additional information for ending up with a unique solution."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-256700": 1, "wikipedia-537048": 1, "wikipedia-320319": 1, "wikipedia-14738000": 1, "wikipedia-1467948": 1, "wikipedia-366445": 1, "wikipedia-55690563": 1, "wikipedia-14220429": 1, "wikipedia-52728349": 1, "wikipedia-203956": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-256700": 1, "wikipedia-537048": 2, "wikipedia-320319": 2, "wikipedia-14738000": 2, "wikipedia-1467948": 1, "wikipedia-366445": 1, "wikipedia-55690563": 1, "wikipedia-14220429": 1, "wikipedia-52728349": 2, "wikipedia-203956": 2}}}

(For example, a puddle growing to be larger would be counted inside the boundaries of Aquinas' usage.) Since a potential does not yet exist, it cannot cause itself to exist and can therefore only be brought into existence by something already existing.\n\nSection::::The Five Ways.:Secunda Via: The Argument of the First Cause.:Explanation.\nAs in the First Way, the causes Aquinas has in mind are not sequential events, but rather simultaneously existing dependency relationships: Aristotle's efficient cause. For example, plant growth depends on sunlight, which depends on gravity, which depends on mass. Aquinas is not arguing for a cause that is first in a sequence, but rather first in a hierarchy: a principal cause, rather than a derivative cause.\n\nSection::::The Five Ways.:Tertia Via: The Argument from Contingency.:Explanation.\nThe argument begins with the observation that things around us come into and go out of existence: animals die, buildings are destroyed, etc. But if \"everything\" were like this, then, at some time nothing would exist. Some interpreters read Aquinas to mean that assuming an infinite past, all possibilities would be realized and everything would go out of existence. Since this is clearly not the case, then there must be at least one thing that does not have the possibility of going out of existence. However, this explanation seems to involve the fallacy of composition (quantifier shift). Moreover, it does not seem to be in keeping with Aquinas' principle that, among natural things, the destruction of one thing is always the generation of another. Alternatively, one could read Aquinas to be arguing as follows: if there is eternal change, so that things are eternally being generated and corrupted, and since an eternal effect requires an eternal cause (just as a necessary conclusion requires necessary premises), then there must exist an eternal agent which can account for the eternity of generation and corruption. To hold the alternative, namely that an infinite series of contingent causes would be able to explain eternal generation and corruption would posit a circular argument: Why is there eternal generation and corruption? Because there is an eternal series of causes which are being generated and corrupted. And why is there an infinite series of causes which are being generated and corrupted? Because there is eternal generation and corruption. Since such an explanation is not acceptable, there must be (at least one) eternal and necessary being.\n\nSection::::The Five Ways.:Quarta Via: The Argument from Degree.:Summary.\nWe see things in the world that vary in degrees of goodness, truth, nobility, etc. For example, well-drawn circles are better than poorly drawn ones, healthy animals are better than sick animals. Moreover, some substances are better than others, since living things are better than non-living things, and animals are better than plants, in testimony of which no one would choose to lose their senses for the sake of having the longevity of a tree. But judging something as being \"more", "The argument is rooted in Aristotle and Plato but its developed form is found in Anselm's Monologion. Although the argument has Platonic influences, Aquinas was not a Platonist and did not believe in the Theory of Forms. Rather, he is arguing that things that only have partial or flawed existence indicate that they are not their own sources of existence, and so must rely on something else as the source of their existence. The argument makes use of the theory of transcendentals: properties of existence. For example, \"true\" presents an aspect of existence, as any existent thing will be \"true\" insofar as it is true that it exists. Or \"one,\" insofar as any existent thing will be (at least) \"one thing.\""], "wikipedia-1180800": ["In computer science, a problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if the problem can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times or a recursive algorithm for the problem solves the same subproblem over and over rather than always generating new subproblems.\nFor example, the problem of computing the Fibonacci sequence exhibits overlapping subproblems. The problem of computing the \"n\"th Fibonacci number \"F\"(\"n\"), can be broken down into the subproblems of computing \"F\"(\"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01) and \"F\"(\"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a02), and then adding the two. The subproblem of computing \"F\"(\"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01) can itself be broken down into a subproblem that involves computing\u00a0\"F\"(\"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a02). Therefore, the computation of \"F\"(\"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a02) is reused, and the Fibonacci sequence thus exhibits overlapping subproblems.\nA naive recursive approach to such a problem generally fails due to an exponential complexity. If the problem also shares an optimal substructure property, dynamic programming is a good way to work it out."], "wikipedia-20728": ["The mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are those mathematical formalisms that permit a rigorous description of quantum mechanics. Such are distinguished from mathematical formalisms for theories developed prior to the early 1900s by the use of abstract mathematical structures, such as infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and operators on these spaces. Many of these structures are drawn from functional analysis, a research area within pure mathematics that was influenced in part by the needs of quantum mechanics. In brief, values of physical observables such as energy and momentum were no longer considered as values of functions on phase space, but as eigenvalues; more precisely as spectral values of linear operators in Hilbert space.\n\nThese formulations of quantum mechanics continue to be used today. At the heart of the description are ideas of \"quantum state\" and \"quantum observables\" which are radically different from those used in previous models of physical reality. While the mathematics permits calculation of many quantities that can be measured experimentally, there is a definite theoretical limit to values that can be simultaneously measured. This limitation was first elucidated by Heisenberg through a thought experiment, and is represented mathematically in the new formalism by the non-commutativity of operators representing quantum observables.\n\nPrior to the emergence of quantum mechanics as a separate theory, the mathematics used in physics consisted mainly of formal mathematical analysis, beginning with calculus, and increasing in complexity up to differential geometry and partial differential equations. Probability theory was used in statistical mechanics. Geometric intuition played a strong role in the first two and, accordingly, theories of relativity were formulated entirely in terms of geometric concepts. The phenomenology of quantum physics arose roughly between 1895 and 1915, and for the 10 to 15 years before the emergence of quantum theory (around 1925) physicists continued to think of quantum theory within the confines of what is now called classical physics, and in particular within the same mathematical structures. The most sophisticated example of this is the Sommerfeld\u2013Wilson\u2013Ishiwara quantization rule, which was formulated entirely on the classical phase space.", "Section::::Mathematical structure of quantum mechanics.\nA physical system is generally described by three basic ingredients: states; observables; and dynamics (or law of time evolution) or, more generally, a group of physical symmetries. A classical description can be given in a fairly direct way by a phase space model of mechanics: states are points in a symplectic phase space, observables are real-valued functions on it, time evolution is given by a one-parameter group of symplectic transformations of the phase space, and physical symmetries are realized by symplectic transformations. A quantum description normally consists of a Hilbert space of states, observables are self adjoint operators on the space of states, time evolution is given by a one-parameter group of unitary transformations on the Hilbert space of states, and physical symmetries are realized by unitary transformations. (It is possible, to map this Hilbert-space picture to a phase space formulation, invertibly. See below.)\nSection::::Mathematical structure of quantum mechanics.:Postulates of quantum mechanics.\nThe following summary of the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics can be partly traced back to the Dirac\u2013von Neumann axioms.\nBULLET::::- Each physical system is associated with a (topologically) separable complex Hilbert space with inner product \u27e8\"\u03c6\"|\"\u03c8\"\u27e9. Rays (that is, subspaces of \"complex\" dimension 1) in are associated with quantum states of the system. In other words, quantum states can be identified with equivalence classes of vectors of length 1 in , where two vectors represent the same state if they differ only by a phase factor. \"Separability\" is a mathematically convenient hypothesis, with the physical interpretation that countably many observations are enough to uniquely determine the state. \"A quantum mechanical state is a \"ray\" in projective Hilbert space, not a \"vector\". Many textbooks fail to make this distinction, which could be partly a result of the fact that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation itself involves Hilbert-space \"vectors\", with the result that the imprecise use of \"state vector\" rather than \"ray\" is very difficult to avoid.\"\nBULLET::::- The Hilbert space of a composite system is the Hilbert space tensor product of the state spaces associated with the component systems (for instance, J. M. Jauch, \"Foundations of quantum mechanics\", section 11.7). For a non-relativistic system consisting of a finite number of distinguishable particles, the component systems are the individual particles.\nBULLET::::- Physical symmetries act on the Hilbert space of quantum states unitarily or antiunitarily due to Wigner's theorem (supersymmetry is another matter entirely).\nBULLET::::- Physical observables are represented by Hermitian matrices on .\nBULLET::::- The expectation value (in the sense of probability theory) of the observable for the system in state represented by the unit vector \u2208 \"H\" is\nBULLET::::- By spectral theory, we can associate a probability measure to the values of in any state . We can also show that the possible values of the observable in any state must belong to the spectrum of . In the special case has only discrete spectrum, the possible outcomes of measuring are its eigenvalues. More precisely, if we represent the state in the basis formed by the eigenvectors of , then the square of the modulus of the component attached to a given eigenvector is the probability of observing its corresponding eigenvalue.\nBULLET::::- More generally, a state can be represented by a so-called density operator, which is a trace class, nonnegative self-adjoint operator normalized to be of trace 1. The expected value of in the state is\nBULLET::::- If is the orthogonal projector onto the one-dimensional subspace of spanned by , then\nBULLET::::- Density operators are those that are in the closure of the convex hull of the one-dimensional orthogonal projectors. Conversely, one-dimensional orthogonal projectors are extreme points of the set of density operators. Physicists also call one-dimensional orthogonal projectors \"pure states\" and other density operators \"mixed states\".\nOne can in this formalism state Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and prove it as a theorem, although the exact historical sequence of events, concerning who derived what and under which framework, is the subject of historical investigations outside the scope of this article.\nFurthermore, to the postulates of quantum mechanics one should also add basic statements on the properties of spin and Pauli's exclusion principle, see below.\nSection::::Mathematical structure of quantum mechanics.:Pictures of dynamics.\nBULLET::::- In the so-called Schr\u00f6dinger picture of quantum mechanics, the dynamics is given as follows:\nThe time evolution of the state is given by a differentiable function from the real numbers , representing instants of time, to the Hilbert space of system states. This map is characterized by a differential equation as follows:\nIf denotes the state of the system at any one time , the following Schr\u00f6dinger equation holds:\nwhere is a densely defined self-adjoint operator, called the system Hamiltonian, is the imaginary unit and is the reduced Planck constant. As an observable, corresponds to the total energy of the system.\nAlternatively, by Stone's theorem one can state that there is a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary map : such that\nfor all times . The existence of a self-adjoint Hamiltonian such that\nis a consequence of Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups. It is assumed that does not depend on time and that the perturbation starts at ; otherwise one must use the Dyson series, formally written as \nwhere formula_7 is Dyson's time-ordering symbol.\n(This symbol permutes a product of noncommuting operators of the form \ninto the uniquely determined re-ordered expression \nThe result is a causal chain, the primary \"cause\" in the past on the utmost r.h.s., and finally the present \"effect\" on the utmost l.h.s.\u00a0.)\nBULLET::::- The Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics focuses on observables and instead of considering states as varying in time, it regards the states as fixed and the observables as changing. To go from the Schr\u00f6dinger to the Heisenberg picture one needs to define time-independent states and time-dependent operators thus:\nIt is then easily checked that the expected values of all observables are the same in both pictures \nand that the time-dependent Heisenberg operators satisfy\nwhich is true for time-dependent . Notice the commutator expression is purely formal when one of the operators is unbounded. One would specify a representation for the expression to make sense of it.\nBULLET::::- The so-called Dirac picture or interaction picture has time-dependent \"states\" and observables, evolving with respect to different Hamiltonians. This picture is most useful when the evolution of the observables can be solved exactly, confining any complications to the evolution of the states. For this reason, the Hamiltonian for the observables is called \"free Hamiltonian\" and the Hamiltonian for the states is called \"interaction Hamiltonian\". In symbols:\nThe interaction picture does not always exist, though. In interacting quantum field theories, Haag's theorem states that the interaction picture does not exist. This is because the Hamiltonian cannot be split into a free and an interacting part within a superselection sector. Moreover, even if in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture the Hamiltonian does not depend on time, e.g. , in the interaction picture it does, at least, if does not commute with , since "], "wikipedia-4222874": ["Section::::Explication of the Kantian account of schemata.:Three types of concepts and their schemata.:Pure sensuous (mathematical) concepts.\nThese are concepts that relate, prior to experience, to the external sense of space and the internal sense of time.

It first examines which parts of science correspond to each of these two categories of scientific thought, and outlines a few principles:\nBULLET::::- What we define as intuition changes with the course of time (Classical philosophers were seen as logicians in their time, but today we might think of them as using intuition) \u2013 it is therefore the ideas that change, in the evolution of scientific thought;\nBULLET::::- This evolution began with the arithmetization of analysis, and ended with the revival of intuitive ideas in an axiomatic system, by the first (true) logicians.\nThis \"historic\" intuition is therefore mathematical intuition. For Poincar\u00e9, it is a result of the principle of least effort, that is, of a link to scientific convention based on experimentation. Convention, thus given a context, permits one to consider different theories of the same problem, and subsequently make a choice based on the degree of simplicity and usefulness of explanations advanced by each of these theories (see also Occam's razor). The example chosen by Poincar\u00e9 is that of three-dimensional space. He shows how the representation of this space is only one possibility, chosen for its usefulness among many models that the mind could create. His demonstration rests on the theory of \"The Mathematical Continuum\" (1893), one of Poincar\u00e9's earlier publications.\nFinally, Poincar\u00e9 advances the idea of a fundamental relationship between the sciences of \"geometry\" and \"analysis\". According to him, intuition has two major roles: to permit one to choose which route to follow in search of scientific truth, and to allow one to comprehend logical developments: Moreover, this relation seems to him inseparable from scientific advancement, which he presents as an enlargement of the framework of science \u2013 new theories incorporating previous ones, even while breaking old patterns of thought.\nSection::::Mathematical physics.\nIn the second part of his book, Poincar\u00e9 studies the links between physics and mathematics. His approach, at once historical and technical, illustrates the preceding general ideas.\nEven though he was rarely an experimenter, Poincar\u00e9 recognizes and defends the importance of experimentation, which must remain a pillar of the scientific method. According to him, it is not necessary that mathematics incorporate physics into itself, but must develop as an asset unto itself. This asset would be above all a tool: in the words of Poincar\u00e9, mathematics is \"the only language in which [physicists] could speak\" to understand each other and to make themselves heard. This language of numbers seems elsewhere to reveal a unity hidden in the natural world, when there may well be only one part of mathematics that applies to theoretical physics. The primary objective of mathematical physics is not invention or discovery, but reformulation. It is an activity of synthesis, which permits one to assure the coherence of theories current at a given time. Poincar\u00e9 recognized that it is impossible to systematize all of physics of a specific time period into one axiomatic theory. His ideas of a three dimensional space are given significance in this context.\nPoincar\u00e9 states that mathematics (analysis) and physics are in the same spirit, that the two disciplines share a common aesthetic goal and that both can liberate humanity from its simple state. In a more pragmatic way, the interdependence of physics and mathematics is similar to his proposed relationship between intuition and analysis. The language of mathematics not only permits one to express scientific advancements, but also to take a step back to comprehend the broader world of nature. Mathematics demonstrates the extent of the specific and limited discoveries made by physicists. On the other hand, physics has a key role for the mathematician - a creative role since it presents atypical problems ingrained in reality. In addition, physics offers solutions and reasoning - thus the development of infinitesimal calculus by Isaac Newton within the framework of Newtonian mechanics.\nMathematical physics finds its scientific origins in the study of celestial mechanics. Initially, it was a consolidation of several fields of physics that dominated the 18th century and which had allowed advancements in both the theoretical and experimental fields. However, in conjunction with the development of thermodynamics (at the time disputed), physicists began developing an energy-based physics. In both its mathematics and its fundamental ideas, this new physics seemed to contradict the Newtonian concept of particle interactions. Poincar\u00e9 terms this the \"first crisis of mathematical physics\".\nSection::::Mathematical physics.:Second crisis.\nThroughout the 19th century, important discoveries were being made in laboratories and elsewhere. Many of these discoveries gave substance to important theories. Other discoveries could not be explained satisfactorily - either they had only been occasionally observed, or they were inconsistent with the new and emerging theories.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the unifying principles were thrown into question. Poincar\u00e9 explains some of the most important principles and their difficulties:\nBULLET::::- The principle of conservation of energy (which he called \"Mayer's principle\") - the discovery of radium and radioactivity posed the problem of the continuous (and seemingly inexhaustible) energy emission of radioactive substances.\nBULLET::::- The principle of entropy (which he called \"Carnot's principle\") - Brownian motion seemed to be in opposition to the second law of thermodynamics.\nBULLET::::- Newton's Third Law (which he called \"Newton's principle\") \u2014 This law seemed to conflict with the laws of electrodynamics proposed by Maxwell, and with the ether theory he had proposed to explain them.\nBULLET::::- The principle of conservation of mass (which he called \"Lavoisier's principle\") \u2014 the consideration of movements at a speed close to that of light posed a problem for this principle; this is again an electrodynamic problem : the mass of a body in such a state of motion is not constant.\nBULLET::::- the principle of relativity .\nBULLET::::- Finally, he added the principle of least action.\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, the majority of scientists spoke of Poincar\u00e9's \"diagnosis\" concerning the crisis of the \"physical principles\". In fact, it was difficult to do otherwise: they had discovered experimental facts which the principles could not account for, and which they evidently could not ignore. Poincar\u00e9 himself remained relatively optimistic regarding the evolution of physics with respect to these severe experimental difficulties. He had little confidence in the nature of principles: they were constructed by physicists because they accommodate and take into account a large number of laws. Their objective value consists in forming a scientific convention, in other words in providing a firm foundation to the basis on which truth and falsehood (in the scientific meaning of the words) are separated.\nBut if these principles are conventions, they are not therefore totally dissociated from experimental fact. On the contrary, if the principles can no longer sustain laws adequately, in accordance with experimental observation, they lose their utility and are rejected, without even having been contradicted. The failure of the laws entails the failure of the principles, because they must account for the results of experiment. To abolish these principles, products of the scientific thought of several centuries, without finding a new explanation that encompasses them (in the same manner that the \"Physics of principles\" encompasses the \"Physics of central forces\"), is to claim that all of past physics has no intellectual value. Consequently, Poincar\u00e9 had great confidence that the principles were salvageable. He said that it was the responsibility of mathematical physics to reconstitute those principles, or to find a replacement for them (the greater goal being to return the field to unity), given that it had played the main role in questioning them only after consolidating them to begin with. Moreover, it was the value of mathematical physics (in terms of the scientific method) which itself saw criticism, due to the implosion of certain theories. Two physics thus existed at the same time: the physics of Galileo and Newton, and the physics of Maxwell; but neither one was able to explain all the experimental observations that technical advances had produced.\nSection::::Mathematical physics.:Electrodynamics of moving bodies.\nThe array of problems encountered concentrated on the electrodynamics of moving bodies. Poincar\u00e9 swiftly proposed the idea that it is the ether modifying itself, and not the bodies acquiring mass, which came to contradict the older theories (based on a perfectly immovable ether). Overall, Poincar\u00e9 shed light on the Zeeman effect, caused by discontinuous emissions of electrons. The problem of discontinuous matter forced the formulation of a minimally-destabilizing model of the atom. In 1913, Niels Bohr presented his atomic model which was based on the concept of electron orbits, and which explained spectroscopy as well as the stability of the atom. But, in 1905, the problem with all attempts to define the behavior of the microscopic world was that no one then knew if they needed to consider a similar model to the one known for the macroscopic objects (the model of classical mechanics), or if they should try to develop an entirely new model to give account of new facts. The latter idea, which was followed with the quantum theory, also implied definitively abandoning the unity already found in prior theories of mechanics.\nSection::::Mathematical physics.:Future of mathematical physics.\nPoincar\u00e9 argued that the advancement of the physical sciences would have to", "In The Value of Science, Poincar\u00e9 writes and repeats his enthusiasm for two lines of research : statistical laws (taking the place of differential laws), and relativistic mechanics (taking the place of Newtonian mechanics). Nevertheless, he did not take into account the ideas of Planck. This latter had in 1900 published the spectral laws governing blackbody radiation, which were the foundation of quantum mechanics. In 1905, the same year as the publication of The Value of Science, Albert Einstein published a decisive article on the photoelectric effect, which he based on the work of Planck. Despite the doubts of Poincar\u00e9, which were no doubt related to his vision of physics as an approximation of reality (in contrast to the exactness of mathematics), the probabilistic rules of quantum mechanics were clearly the response to the second crisis of mathematical physics, at the end of the nineteenth century. (One can point out that in 1902, Poincar\u00e9 envisaged a relativistic physics which closely matched, in its theoretical development, the one developed and propounded by Einstein several years later.)"], "wikipedia-19594028": ["BULLET::::- Weak interaction\nBULLET::::- Electroweak interaction\nBULLET::::- Analog models of gravity\nBULLET::::- Conservation law\nBULLET::::- Conservation of energy\nBULLET::::- Conservation of mass\nBULLET::::- Conservation of momentum\nBULLET::::- Conservation of angular momentum\nBULLET::::- Thermodynamics\nBULLET::::- Laws of thermodynamics\nBULLET::::- Newton's laws of motion\nBULLET::::- Dynamics\nBULLET::::- Dynamo theory\nBULLET::::- Kinetic theory of gases\nBULLET::::- Electromagnetism\nBULLET::::- Field theory\nBULLET::::- Classical field theory\nBULLET::::- Scattering theory\nBULLET::::- Quantum field theory\nBULLET::::- Quantum field theory in curved spacetime\nBULLET::::- Conformal field theory\nBULLET::::- Fluid mechanics\nBULLET::::- Fluid dynamics\nBULLET::::- Information theory\nBULLET::::- Algorithmic information theory\nBULLET::::- Quantum information theory\nBULLET::::- Theoretical computer science\nBULLET::::- Computational complexity theory\nBULLET::::- Quantum complexity theory\nBULLET::::- Theory of relativity\nBULLET::::- General relativity\nBULLET::::- Special relativity\nBULLET::::- Physical cosmology\nBULLET::::- Quantum mechanics\nBULLET::::- Fractional quantum mechanics\nBULLET::::- Relativistic quantum mechanics\nBULLET::::- Quantum dynamics\nBULLET::::- Quantum chromodynamics\nBULLET::::- Quantum computing\nBULLET::::- Quantum electrochemistry\nBULLET::::- Quantum electrodynamics\nBULLET::::- Quantum geometry\nBULLET::::- Quantum chaos\nBULLET::::- Chaos theory\nBULLET::::- Perturbation theory\nBULLET::::- Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)\nBULLET::::- Dark matter\nBULLET::::- Cosmological Constant\nBULLET::::- Gravitational constant\nBULLET::::- Standard Model\nBULLET::::- Spontaneous symmetry breaking\nSection::::Proposed theories.\nThe proposed theories of physics are usually relatively new theories which deal with the study of physics which include scientific approaches, means for determining the validity of models and new types of reasoning used to arrive at the theory.

Tao was a recipient of the 2006 Fields Medal and the 2014 Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics.\nHe is the second ethnic Chinese person to win the Fields medal after Shing-Tung Yau, and the first Australian mathematician to win the Fields medal.\nTao exhibited extraordinary mathematical abilities from an early age, attending university-level mathematics courses at the age of 9. He and Lenhard Ng are the only two children in the history of the Johns Hopkins' Study of Exceptional Talent program to have achieved a score of 700 or greater on the SAT math section while just nine years old; Tao scored a 760. Tao was the youngest participant to date in the International Mathematical Olympiad, first competing at the age of ten; in 1986, 1987, and 1988, he won a bronze, silver, and gold medal. He remains the youngest winner of each of the three medals in the Olympiad's history, winning the gold medal shortly after his thirteenth birthday. \nWithin the field of mathematics, Tao is known for his collaboration with Ben J. Green of Oxford University; together they proved the Green\u2013Tao theorem.

Technology reduces the amount of attention, memory, and computation required by users, making higher mathematical topics accessible to young children. However, the main opportunity technology provides is not in making traditional mathematical tasks more accessible, but in introducing children to novel activities that are not possible without computers.\n\nFor example, computer modeling allows children to change parameters in virtual systems created by educators and observe emergent mathematical behaviors, or remix and create their own models. The pedagogical approach of constructionism describes how creating algorithms, programs and models on computers promotes deep mathematical thinking. Technology allows children to experience these complex concepts in a more visual manner.\n\nComputer algebra systems are software environments that support and scaffold working with symbolic expressions. Some computer algebra systems have intuitive, child-friendly interfaces and therefore can be used in Early Algebra. Interactive geometry software supports creation and manipulation of geometric constructions. Both computer algebra systems and interactive geometry software help with several cognitive limitations of young children, such as attention and memory. The software scaffolds step-by-step procedures, helping children focus attention. It has \"undo\" capabilities, lowering frustration when errors happen, and promoting creativity and exploration.

The last three lines on the blackboard are estimates of the density of matter in the universe \"\u03c1\", the radius of the universe \"P\" and the timespan \"t\" of the expansion of the universe respectively (\"L.J.\" on the blackboard indicates \"light years\" in German). It has recently been shown that these estimates contain a systematic numerical error.\n\nIt has recently been pointed out that the equations on the Oxford blackboard are taken directly from a key paper on relativistic cosmology written by Einstein in April 1931 and published in the Proceedings of the Royal Prussian Academy of Science on May 9 of that year. The paper, known as The Friedmann-Einstein universe, is of historic significance because it constituted the first scientific publication in which Einstein embraced the possibility of a cosmos of time-varying radius. In the paper, Einstein adopts Alexander Friedman's 1922 analysis of relativistic models of a universe of time-varying radius and positive curvature, but sets the cosmological constant to zero, declaring it redundant, predicting a universe that expands and contracts over time. (The work is sometimes known as the Friedman-Einstein model of the universe). With the use of Edwin Hubble's observations of a linear redshift/distance relation for the spiral nebulae, Einstein extracts from his model estimates of \"\u03c1\" ~ 10 g/cm, \"P\" ~ 10 light-years and \"t\" ~ 10 years for the density of matter, the radius of the cosmos and the timespan of the cosmic expansion respectively. These values are displayed in the last three lines on the Oxford blackboard (although the units of measurement are not specifically stated for the density estimate, cgs units are implied by the other calculations).\n\nOne line on the blackboard, not included in the published paper, makes the nature of Einstein's error clear. In the fourth line on the blackboard, Einstein obtains a value of 10 cm for the quantity \"D\", defined in the top line of the blackboard as \"D\" = (1/c). (1/P).(dP/dt), i.e., the Hubble constant divided by the speed of light. Simple calculation shows that the contemporaneous value of the Hubble constant in fact implied a value of \"D\" ~ 10 cm (or 10 m) for this quantity. It appears that Einstein stumbled in converting megaparsecs to cm, giving a density of matter that was too high by a factor of a hundred, a cosmic radius that was too low by a factor of ten, and a timespan for the expansion that was too high by a factor of ten."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

In the case of the ANS, as the ratio between the magnitudes increases, the ability to discriminate between the two quantities increases.\n\nToday, some theorize that the ANS lays the foundation for higher-level arithmetical concepts. Research has shown that the same areas of the brain are active during non-symbolic number tasks in infants and both non-symbolic and more sophisticated symbolic number tasks in adults. These results could suggest that the ANS contributes over time to the development of higher-level numerical skills that activate the same part of the brain.\n\nParietal lobe brain activity seen in adults is also observed during infancy during non-verbal numerical tasks, suggesting that the ANS is present very early in life.

The query can be partially answered using Wikipedia. David Hilbert was a renowned German mathematician known for his foundational contributions to various fields, including algebra, geometry, and mathematical logic. Wikipedia describes him as one of the most influential mathematicians of the 19th and 20th centuries, often noted for his broad expertise\u2014hence the \"master of all mathematics\" characterization. However, the phrase \"master of all mathematics\" may be hyperbolic, as Wikipedia emphasizes his significant impact rather than universal mastery.", "wikipedia-8302": ["David Hilbert (; ; 23 January 1862 \u2013 14 February 1943) was a German mathematician and one of the most influential and universal mathematicians of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Hilbert discovered and developed a broad range of fundamental ideas in many areas, including invariant theory, the calculus of variations, commutative algebra, algebraic number theory, the foundations of geometry, spectral theory of operators and its application to integral equations, mathematical physics, and foundations of mathematics (particularly proof theory).\nHilbert adopted and warmly defended Georg Cantor's set theory and transfinite numbers. A famous example of his leadership in mathematics is his 1900 presentation of a collection of problems that set the course for much of the mathematical research of the 20th century.\nHilbert and his students contributed significantly to establishing rigor and developed important tools used in modern mathematical physics. Hilbert is known as one of the founders of proof theory and mathematical logic, as well as for being among the first to distinguish between mathematics and metamathematics.", "Hilbert put forth a most influential list of 23 unsolved problems at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. This is generally reckoned as the most successful and deeply considered compilation of open problems ever to be produced by an individual mathematician.\n\nAfter re-working the foundations of classical geometry, Hilbert could have extrapolated to the rest of mathematics. His approach differed, however, from the later 'foundationalist' Russell-Whitehead or 'encyclopedist' Nicolas Bourbaki, and from his contemporary Giuseppe Peano. The mathematical community as a whole could enlist in problems, which he had identified as crucial aspects of the areas of mathematics he took to be key.", "Hilbert unified the field of algebraic number theory with his 1897 treatise \"Zahlbericht\" (literally \"report on numbers\"). He also resolved a significant number-theory problem formulated by Waring in 1770. As with the finiteness theorem, he used an existence proof that shows there must be solutions for the problem rather than providing a mechanism to produce the answers. He then had little more to publish on the subject; but the emergence of Hilbert modular forms in the dissertation of a student means his name is further attached to a major area.\nHe made a series of conjectures on class field theory. The concepts were highly influential, and his own contribution lives on in the names of the Hilbert class field and of the Hilbert symbol of local class field theory. Results were mostly proved by 1930, after work by Teiji Takagi.\nHilbert did not work in the central areas of analytic number theory, but his name has become known for the Hilbert\u2013P\u00f3lya conjecture, for reasons that are anecdotal.\nAdditionally, Hilbert's work anticipated and assisted several advances in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. His work was a key aspect of Hermann Weyl and John von Neumann's work on the mathematical equivalence of Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger's wave equation and his namesake Hilbert space plays an important part in quantum theory. In 1926 von Neumann showed that if quantum states were understood as vectors in Hilbert space, then they would correspond with both Schr\u00f6dinger's wave function theory and Heisenberg's matrices.\nThroughout this immersion in physics, Hilbert worked on putting rigor into the mathematics of physics. While highly dependent on higher mathematics, physicists tended to be \"sloppy\" with it. To a \"pure\" mathematician like Hilbert, this was both \"ugly\" and difficult to understand. As he began to understand physics and how physicists were using mathematics, he developed a coherent mathematical theory for what he found, most importantly in the area of integral equations. When his colleague Richard Courant wrote the now classic \"Methoden der mathematischen Physik\" (Methods of Mathematical Physics) including some of Hilbert's ideas, he added Hilbert's name as author even though Hilbert had not directly contributed to the writing. Hilbert said \"Physics is too hard for physicists\", implying that the necessary mathematics was generally beyond them; the Courant-Hilbert book made it easier for them."], "wikipedia-607286": ["Hilbert's program, formulated by German mathematician David Hilbert in the early part of the 20th century, was a proposed solution to the foundational crisis of mathematics, when early attempts to clarify the foundations of mathematics were found to suffer from paradoxes and inconsistencies. As a solution, Hilbert proposed to ground all existing theories to a finite, complete set of axioms, and provide a proof that these axioms were consistent. Hilbert proposed that the consistency of more complicated systems, such as real analysis, could be proven in terms of simpler systems. Ultimately, the consistency of all of mathematics could be reduced to basic arithmetic."], "wikipedia-19245793": ["In a foundational controversy in twentieth-century mathematics, L. E. J. Brouwer, a supporter of intuitionism, opposed David Hilbert, the founder of formalism.", "In the late 1890s Hilbert successfully axiomatized geometry. Then he went on to successfully (or so Hilbert thought) use the Cantorian-inspired notion of the completed infinity to produce elegant, radically abbreviated proofs in analysis (1896 and afterwards). In his own words of defense Hilbert believed himself quite justified in what he had done (in the following he calls this type of proof an existence proof): \"...I stated a general theorem (1896) on algebraic forms that is a pure existence statement and by its very nature cannot be transformed into a statement involving constructibility. Purely by use of this existence theorem I avoided the lengthy and unclear argumentation of Weierstrass and the highly complicated calculations of Dedekind, and in addition, I believe, only my proof uncovers the inner reason for the validity of the assertions adumbrated by Gauss and formulated by Weierstrass and Dedekind.\" \"The value of pure existence proofs consists precisely in that the individual construction is eliminated by them and that many different constructions are subsumed under one fundamental idea, so that only what is essential to the proof stands out clearly; brevity and economy of thought are the \"raison d'\u00eatre\" of existence proofs.\""], "wikipedia-20029977": ["The achievements of David Hilbert were now considered.
