Letter frequency analysis gained additional importance in Europe with the development of movable type in 1450 AD, where one must estimate the amount of type required for each letterform, as evidenced by the variations in letter compartment size in typographer's type cases.\n\nLinguists use letter frequency analysis as a rudimentary technique for language identification, where it's particularly effective as an indication of whether an unknown writing system is alphabetic, syllablic, or ideographic. For example, the Japanese Hiragana syllabary contains 46\u00a0distinct characters, which is more than most phonetic alphabets; by contrast, the English and Hawaiian alphabets have only 26 and 13\u00a0letters, respectively.\n\nNo exact letter frequency distribution underlies a given language, since all writers write slightly differently. However, most languages have a characteristic distribution which is strongly apparent in longer texts.

This is sometimes argued to be in competition with phonics and synthetic phonics methods.\n\nEnglish spelling is based on the alphabetic principle. In an alphabetic writing system, letters are used to represent speech sounds, or phonemes. For example, the word \"pat\" is spelled with three letters, \"p\", \"a\", and \"t\", each representing a phoneme, respectively, , , and .\n\nThe spelling structures for some alphabetic languages, such as Spanish, Portuguese and especially Italian, are comparatively orthographically transparent, or orthographically shallow, because there is nearly a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letter patterns that represent them. English spelling is more complex, a deep orthography, partly because it attempts to represent the 40+ phonemes of the spoken language with an alphabet composed of only 26 letters (and no diacritics). As a result, two letters are often used together to represent distinct sounds, referred to as \"digraphs\". For example, \"t\" and \"h\" placed side by side to represent either or .\n\nEnglish has absorbed many words from other languages throughout its history, usually without changing the spelling of those words. As a result, the written form of English includes the spelling patterns of many languages (Old English, Old Norse, Norman French, Classical Latin and Greek, as well as numerous modern languages) superimposed upon one another. These overlapping spelling patterns mean that in many cases the same sound can be spelled differently and the same spelling can represent different sounds. However, the spelling patterns usually follow certain conventions. In addition, the Great Vowel Shift, a historical linguistic process in which the quality of many vowels in English changed while the spelling remained as it was, greatly diminished the transparency of English spelling in relation to pronunciation.\n\nThe result is that English spelling patterns vary considerably in the degree to which they follow rules. For example, the letters \"ee\" almost always represent , but the sound can also be represented by the letters \"i\" and \"y\". Similarly, the letter cluster \"ough\" represents as in \"enough\", as in \"though\", as in \"through\", as in \"cough\", as in \"bough\", as in \"bought\", and as in \"hiccough\", while in \"slough\" and \"lough\", the pronunciation varies.\n\nAlthough the patterns are inconsistent, when English spelling rules take into account syllable structure, phonetics, etymology and accents, there are dozens of rules that are 75% or more reliable. This level of reliability can only be achieved by extending the rules far outside the domain of phonics, which deals with letter-sound correspondences, and into the morphophonemic and morphological domains. For an estimate of the reliability of strictly phonic rules, we still cannot do much better than the 1963 study by Theodore Clymer.", "They found that phonics instruction must be systematic (following a sequence of increasingly challenging phonics patterns) and explicit (teaching students precisely how the patterns worked, e.g., \"this is \"b\", it stands for the /b/ sound\").\n\nIn 2017, research published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology has shown that learning to read by sounding out words (i.e. phonics) has a dramatic impact on the accuracy of reading aloud and comprehension.

Systematic reviews formulate research questions that are broad or narrow in scope, and identify and synthesize studies that directly relate to the systematic review question. They are designed to provide a complete, exhaustive summary of current evidence relevant to a research question.\n\nA systematic review aims to provide a complete, exhaustive summary of current literature relevant to a research question. The first step in conducting a systematic review is to create a structured question to guide the review. The second step is to perform a thorough search of the literature for relevant papers. The \"Methodology\" section of a systematic review will list all of the databases and citation indexes that were searched such as Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed and any individual journals that were searched. The searching of different databases is a hallmark of clinical trials. In this regard, more recently there has been increased recognition of the importance of using different search technologies, with artificial intelligence-based tools gaining recognition. The titles and abstracts of identified articles are checked against pre-determined criteria for eligibility and relevance to form an inclusion set. This set will relate back to the research problem. Each included study may be assigned an objective assessment of methodological quality preferably by using methods conforming to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (the current guideline) or the high quality standards of Cochrane.\n\nSystematic reviews often, but not always, use statistical techniques (meta-analysis) to combine results of eligible studies, or at least use scoring of the levels of evidence depending on the methodology used. An additional rater may be consulted to resolve any scoring differences between raters. Systematic review is often applied in the biomedical or healthcare context, but it can be applied in any field of research. Groups like the Campbell Collaboration are promoting the use of systematic reviews in policy-making beyond just healthcare.\n\nA systematic review uses an objective and transparent approach for research synthesis, with the aim of minimizing bias. While many systematic reviews are based on an explicit quantitative meta-analysis of available data, there are also qualitative reviews which adhere to standards for gathering, analyzing and reporting evidence. The EPPI-Centre has been influential in developing methods for combining both qualitative and quantitative research in systematic reviews. The PRISMA statement suggests a standardized way to ensure a transparent and complete reporting of systematic reviews, and is now required for this kind of research by more than 170 medical journals worldwide."], "wikipedia-473317": ["Social scientists use content analysis to examine patterns in communication in a replicable and systematic manner.

This structure can be described by the pattern \"bidirectional rotary motor-driven propeller\". Dembski estimates that there are at most 10 patterns described by four basic concepts or fewer, and so his test for design will apply if\nHowever, Dembski says that the precise calculation of the relevant probability \"has yet to be done\", although he also claims that some methods for calculating these probabilities \"are now in place\".\nThese methods assume that all of the constituent parts of the flagellum must have been generated completely at random, a scenario that biologists do not seriously consider. He justifies this approach by appealing to Michael Behe's concept of \"irreducible complexity\" (IC), which leads him to assume that the flagellum could not come about by any gradual or step-wise process. The validity of Dembski's particular calculation is thus wholly dependent on Behe's IC concept, and therefore susceptible to its criticisms, of which there are many.\nTo arrive at the ranking upper bound of 10 patterns, Dembski considers a specification pattern for the flagellum defined by the (natural language) predicate \"bidirectional rotary motor-driven propeller\", which he regards as being determined by four independently chosen basic concepts.

In this experiment, a direct relationship between information and another physical property, entropy, is demonstrated. A consequence is that it is impossible to destroy information without increasing the entropy of a system; in practical terms this often means generating heat. Another more philosophical outcome is that information could be thought of as interchangeable with energy. Toyabe et al. experimentally showed in nature that information can be converted into work. Thus, in the study of logic gates, the theoretical lower bound of thermal energy released by an \"AND gate\" is higher than for the \"NOT gate\" (because information is destroyed in an \"AND gate\" and simply converted in a \"NOT gate\").

These topics provide a foundation for understanding the query.", "wikipedia-18985062": ["The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence and is inversely proportional to that. The more uncertain an event, the more information is required to resolve uncertainty of that event. The bit is a typical unit of information, but other units such as the nat may be used. For example, the information encoded in one \"fair\" coin flip is log(2/1) = 1 bit, and in two fair coin flips is log(4/1) = 2 bits.\n\nThe cognitive scientist and applied mathematician Ronaldo Vigo argues that information is a concept that requires at least two related entities to make quantitative sense. These are, any dimensionally defined category of objects S, and any of its subsets R. R, in essence, is a representation of S, or, in other words, conveys representational (and hence, conceptual) information about S. Vigo then defines the amount of information that R conveys about S as the rate of change in the complexity of S whenever the objects in R are removed from S. Under \"Vigo information\", pattern, invariance, complexity, representation, and information\u2014five fundamental constructs of universal science\u2014are unified under a novel mathematical framework. Among other things, the framework aims to overcome the limitations of Shannon-Weaver information when attempting to characterize and measure subjective information.\n\nInformation is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns. In this sense, there is no need for a conscious mind to perceive, much less appreciate, the pattern. Consider, for example, DNA. The sequence of nucleotides is a pattern that influences the formation and development of an organism without any need for a conscious mind. One might argue though that for a human to consciously define a pattern, for example a nucleotide, naturally involves conscious information processing.", "In thermodynamics, information is any kind of event that affects the state of a dynamic system that can interpret the information.\n\nMichael Buckland has classified \"information\" in terms of its uses: \"information as process\", \"information as knowledge\", and \"information as thing\".\n\nBeynon-Davies explains the multi-faceted concept of information in terms of signs and signal-sign systems. Signs themselves can be considered in terms of four inter-dependent levels, layers or branches of semiotics: pragmatics, semantics, syntax, and empirics. These four layers serve to connect the social world on the one hand with the physical or technical world on the other.\n\nPragmatics is concerned with the purpose of communication. Pragmatics links the issue of signs with the context within which signs are used. The focus of pragmatics is on the intentions of living agents underlying communicative behaviour. In other words, pragmatics link language to action.\n\nSemantics is concerned with the meaning of a message conveyed in a communicative act. Semantics considers the content of communication. Semantics is the study of the meaning of signs - the association between signs and behaviour. Semantics can be considered as the study of the link between symbols and their referents or concepts \u2013 particularly the way that signs relate to human behavior.\n\nSyntax is concerned with the formalism used to represent a message. Syntax as an area studies the form of communication in terms of the logic and grammar of sign systems. Syntax is devoted to the study of the form rather than the content of signs and sign-systems."], "wikipedia-243627": ["In a general sense, the information of an entity is that which resolves the uncertainty of its properties.

Christopher Alexander describes common design problems as arising from \"conflicting forces\" \u2014 such as the conflict between wanting a room to be sunny and wanting it not to overheat on summer afternoons. A pattern would not tell the designer how many windows to put in the room; instead, it would propose a set of values to guide the designer toward a decision that is best for their particular application. Alexander, for example, suggests that enough windows should be included to direct light all around the room. He considers this a good solution because he believes it increases the enjoyment of the room by its occupants.

However, the explanation might lack depth on specific proprietary or cutting-edge methods used in industry.", "wikipedia-360030": ["Keyword extraction is the first step for identifying the input question type . In some cases, there are clear words that indicate the question type directly. i.e. \"Who\", \"Where\" or \"How many\", these words tell the system that the answers should be of type \"Person\", \"Location\", \"Number\" respectively. In the example above, the word \"When\" indicates that the answer should be of type \"Date\". POS (part-of-speech) tagging and syntactic parsing techniques can also be used to determine the answer type. In this case, the subject is \"Chinese National Day\", the predicate is \"is\" and the adverbial modifier is \"when\", therefore the answer type is \"Date\". Unfortunately, some interrogative words like \"Which\", \"What\" or \"How\" do not give clear answer types. Each of these words can represent more than one type. In situations like this, other words in the question need to be considered. First thing to do is to find the words that can indicate the meaning of the question. A lexical dictionary such as WordNet can then be used for understanding the context.\nOnce the question type has been identified, an information retrieval system is used to find a set of documents containing the correct key words. A tagger and NP/Verb Group chunker can be used to verify whether the correct entities and relations are mentioned in the found documents. For questions such as \"Who\" or \"Where\", a named-entity recogniser is used to find relevant \"Person\" and \"Location\" names from the retrieved documents. Only the relevant paragraphs are selected for ranking.\nA vector space model can be used as a strategy for classifying the candidate answers. Check if the answer is of the correct type as determined in the question type analysis stage. An inference technique can also be used to validate the candidate answers.

The result is an absolute number; an FFR of 0.80 means that a given stenosis causes a 20% drop in blood pressure. In other words, FFR expresses the maximal flow down a vessel in the presence of a stenosis compared to the maximal flow in the hypothetical absence of the stenosis.\n\nFractional flow reserve (FFR) is the ratio of maximum blood flow distal to a stenotic lesion to normal maximum flow in the same vessel. It is calculated using the pressure ratio\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 is the pressure distal to the lesion, and formula_3 is the pressure proximal to the lesion.\n\nIn the DEFER study, fractional flow reserve was used to determine the need for stenting in patients with intermediate single vessel disease. In those patients with a stenosis with an FFR of less than 0.75, outcome was significantly worse. In patients with an FFR of 0.75 or more however, stenting did not influence outcomes. This suggests that FFR is a useful tool to gauge decision-making in this setting.\n\nThe \"Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation\" (FAME) study evaluated the role of FFR in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. In 20 centers in Europe and the United States, 1005 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with drug eluting stent implantation were randomized to intervention based on angiography or based on fractional flow reserve in addition to angiography. In the angiography arm of the study, all suspicious-looking lesions were stented. In the FFR arm, only angiographically suspicious lesions with an FFR of 0.80 or less were stented.\n\nIn the patients whose care was guided by FFR, fewer stents were used (2.7\u00b11.2 and 1.9\u00b11.3, respectively).

The amount of information conveyed by each event defined in this way becomes a random variable whose expected value is the information entropy. Generally, \"entropy\" refers to disorder or uncertainty, and the definition of entropy used in information theory is directly analogous to the definition used in statistical thermodynamics. The concept of information entropy was introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\".\n\nThe basic idea of information theory is that the \"news value\" of a communicated message depends on the degree to which the content of the message is surprising. If an event is very probable, it is no surprise (and generally uninteresting) when that event happens as expected. However, if an event is unlikely to occur, it is much more informative to learn that the event happened or will happen. For instance, the knowledge that some particular number \"will not\" be the winning number of a lottery provides very little information, because any particular chosen number will almost certainly not win. However, knowledge that a particular number \"will\" win a lottery has high value because it communicates the outcome of a very low probability event. The information content (also called the \"surprisal\") of an event formula_2 is an increasing function of the reciprocal of the probability formula_3 of the event, precisely formula_4. Entropy measures the expected (i.e., average) amount of information conveyed by identifying the outcome of a random trial. This implies that casting a die has higher entropy than tossing a coin because each outcome of a die toss has smaller probability (about formula_5) than each outcome of a coin toss (formula_6).\n\nEntropy is a measure of the \"unpredictability\" of the state, or equivalently, of its \"average information content\". To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the poll is not already known. In other words, the outcome of the poll is relatively \"unpredictable\", and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new \"information\"; these are just different ways of saying that the \"a priori\" entropy of the poll results is large. Now, consider the case that the same poll is performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first poll is already known, the outcome of the second poll can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the \"a priori\" entropy of the second poll result is small relative to that of the first.\n\nConsider the example of a coin toss. If the probability of heads is the same as the probability of tails, then the entropy of the coin toss is as high as it could be for a two-outcome trial. There is no way to predict the outcome of the coin toss ahead of time: if one has to choose, there is no average advantage to be gained by predicting that the toss will come up heads or tails, as either prediction will be correct with probability formula_7. Such a coin toss has one bit of entropy since there are two possible outcomes that occur with equal probability, and learning the actual outcome contains one bit of information. In contrast, a coin toss using a coin that has two heads and no tails has zero entropy since the coin will always come up heads, and the outcome can be predicted perfectly. Analogously, a binary event with equiprobable outcomes has a Shannon entropy of formula_8 bit.

Entropy is zero when one outcome is certain to occur. The entropy quantifies these considerations when a probability distribution of the source data is known.

The amount of information conveyed by each event defined in this way becomes a random variable whose expected value is the information entropy. Generally, \"entropy\" refers to disorder or uncertainty, and the definition of entropy used in information theory is directly analogous to the definition used in statistical thermodynamics. The concept of information entropy was introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\".\n\nThe logarithm of the probability distribution is useful as a measure of entropy because it is additive for independent sources. For instance, the entropy of a fair coin toss is 1 bit, and the entropy of tosses is bits. In a straightforward representation, bits are needed to represent a variable that can take one of values if is a power of 2. If these values are equally probable, the entropy (in bits) is equal to . If one of the values is more probable to occur than the others, an observation that this value occurs is less informative than if some less common outcome had occurred. Conversely, rarer events provide more information when observed. Since observation of less probable events occurs more rarely, the net effect is that the entropy (thought of as average information) received from non-uniformly distributed data is always less than or equal to . Entropy is zero when one outcome is certain to occur. The entropy quantifies these considerations when a probability distribution of the source data is known. The \"meaning\" of the events observed (the meaning of \"messages\") does not matter in the definition of entropy. Entropy only takes into account the probability of observing a specific event, so the information it encapsulates is information about the underlying probability distribution, not the meaning of the events themselves.", "The entropy of the unknown result of the next toss of the coin is maximized if the coin is fair (that is, if heads and tails both have equal probability 1/2). This is the situation of maximum uncertainty as it is most difficult to predict the outcome of the next toss; the result of each toss of the coin delivers one full bit of information. This is because\n\nHowever, if we know the coin is not fair, but comes up heads or tails with probabilities and , where , then there is less uncertainty. Every time it is tossed, one side is more likely to come up than the other. The reduced uncertainty is quantified in a lower entropy: on average each toss of the coin delivers less than one full bit of information. For example, if =0.7, then\n\nUniform probability yields maximum uncertainty and therefore maximum entropy. Entropy, then, can only decrease from the value associated with uniform probability. The extreme case is that of a double-headed coin that never comes up tails, or a double-tailed coin that never results in a head. Then there is no uncertainty. The entropy is zero: each toss of the coin delivers no new information as the outcome of each coin toss is always certain.\n\nEntropy can be normalized by dividing it by information length. This ratio is called metric entropy and is a measure of the randomness of the information.\n\nShannon discovered that the proper choice of function to quantify information, preserving this additivity, is logarithmic, i.e.,\n\nlet formula_30 be the information function which one assumes to be twice continuously differentiable, one has:\n\nThis differential equation leads to the solution formula_32 for any formula_33.

The different units of information (bits for the binary logarithm , nats for the natural logarithm , bans for the decimal logarithm and so on) are constant multiples of each other. For instance, in case of a fair coin toss, heads provides bit of information, which is approximately 0.693\u00a0nats or 0.301\u00a0decimal digits. Because of additivity, tosses provide bits of information, which is approximately nats or decimal digits.\n\nIf there is a distribution where event can happen with probability , and it is sampled times with an outcome occurring times, the total amount of information we have received is \n\nThe \"average\" amount of information that we receive per event is therefore"], "wikipedia-5642853": ["The logarithmic probability measure self-information or surprisal, whose average is information entropy/uncertainty and whose average difference is KL-divergence, has applications to odds-analysis all by itself. Its two primary strengths are that surprisals: (i) reduce minuscule probabilities to numbers of manageable size, and (ii) add whenever probabilities multiply.\n\nFor example, one might say that \"the number of states equals two to the number of bits\" i.e. #states = 2. Here the quantity that's measured in bits is the logarithmic information measure mentioned above. Hence there are N bits of surprisal in landing all heads on one's first toss of N coins.\n\nThe additive nature of surprisals, and one's ability to get a feel for their meaning with a handful of coins, can help one put improbable events (like winning the lottery, or having an accident) into context. For example if one out of 17 million tickets is a winner, then the surprisal of winning from a single random selection is about 24 bits. Tossing 24 coins a few times might give you a feel for the surprisal of getting all heads on the first try.\n\nThe additive nature of this measure also comes in handy when weighing alternatives. For example, imagine that the surprisal of harm from a vaccination is 20 bits. If the surprisal of catching a disease without it is 16 bits, but the surprisal of harm from the disease if you catch it is 2 bits, then the surprisal of harm from NOT getting the vaccination is only 16+2=18 bits. Whether or not you decide to get the vaccination (e.g. the monetary cost of paying for it is not included in this discussion), you can in that way at least take responsibility for a decision informed to the fact that not getting the vaccination involves more than one bit of additional risk.\n\nMore generally, one can relate probability p to bits of surprisal \"sbits\" as probability = 1/2. As suggested above, this is mainly useful with small probabilities.

Generally, \"entropy\" refers to disorder or uncertainty, and the definition of entropy used in information theory is directly analogous to the definition used in statistical thermodynamics. The logarithm of the probability distribution is useful as a measure of entropy because it is additive for independent sources. For instance, the entropy of a fair coin toss is 1 bit, and the entropy of tosses is bits. In a straightforward representation, bits are needed to represent a variable that can take one of values if is a power of 2. If these values are equally probable, the entropy (in bits) is equal to . If one of the values is more probable to occur than the others, an observation that this value occurs is less informative than if some less common outcome had occurred.

Entropy is zero when one outcome is certain to occur. The entropy quantifies these considerations when a probability distribution of the source data is known.

It states that joint probability of independent sources of information communicates as much information as the two individual events separately. Particularly, if the first event can yield one of equiprobable outcomes and another has one of equiprobable outcomes then there are possible outcomes of the joint event. This means that if bits are needed to encode the first value and to encode the second, one needs to encode both.

There is no way to predict the outcome of the coin toss ahead of time: if one has to choose, there is no average advantage to be gained by predicting that the toss will come up heads or tails, as either prediction will be correct with probability formula_7. Such a coin toss has one bit of entropy since there are two possible outcomes that occur with equal probability, and learning the actual outcome contains one bit of information. In contrast, a coin toss using a coin that has two heads and no tails has zero entropy since the coin will always come up heads, and the outcome can be predicted perfectly. Analogously, a binary event with equiprobable outcomes has a Shannon entropy of formula_8 bit. Similarly, one trit with equiprobable values contains formula_9 (about 1.58496) bits of information because it can have one of three values.", "The entropy of the unknown result of the next toss of the coin is maximized if the coin is fair (that is, if heads and tails both have equal probability 1/2). This is the situation of maximum uncertainty as it is most difficult to predict the outcome of the next toss; the result of each toss of the coin delivers one full bit of information. This is because\n\nHowever, if we know the coin is not fair, but comes up heads or tails with probabilities and , where , then there is less uncertainty. Every time it is tossed, one side is more likely to come up than the other. The reduced uncertainty is quantified in a lower entropy: on average each toss of the coin delivers less than one full bit of information. For example, if =0.7, then\n\nUniform probability yields maximum uncertainty and therefore maximum entropy. Entropy, then, can only decrease from the value associated with uniform probability. The extreme case is that of a double-headed coin that never comes up tails, or a double-tailed coin that never results in a head. Then there is no uncertainty. The entropy is zero: each toss of the coin delivers no new information as the outcome of each coin toss is always certain."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-427282": 1, "wikipedia-63778": 1, "wikipedia-26945226": 1, "wikipedia-5987648": 1, "wikipedia-15445": 3, "wikipedia-467527": 1, "wikipedia-4701197": 1, "wikipedia-4751128": 1, "wikipedia-13954448": 1, "wikipedia-3325140": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-427282": 1, "wikipedia-63778": 2, "wikipedia-26945226": 1, "wikipedia-5987648": 1, "wikipedia-15445": 3, "wikipedia-467527": 1, "wikipedia-4701197": 1, "wikipedia-4751128": 1, "wikipedia-13954448": 1, "wikipedia-3325140": 1}}}

If an event is very probable, it is no surprise (and generally uninteresting) when that event happens as expected. However, if an event is unlikely to occur, it is much more informative to learn that the event happened or will happen. For instance, the knowledge that some particular number \"will not\" be the winning number of a lottery provides very little information, because any particular chosen number will almost certainly not win. However, knowledge that a particular number \"will\" win a lottery has high value because it communicates the outcome of a very low probability event. The information content (also called the \"surprisal\") of an event formula_2 is an increasing function of the reciprocal of the probability formula_3 of the event, precisely formula_4. Entropy measures the expected (i.e., average) amount of information conveyed by identifying the outcome of a random trial. This implies that casting a die has higher entropy than tossing a coin because each outcome of a die toss has smaller probability (about formula_5) than each outcome of a coin toss (formula_6).\n\nEntropy is a measure of the \"unpredictability\" of the state, or equivalently, of its \"average information content\". To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the poll is not already known. In other words, the outcome of the poll is relatively \"unpredictable\", and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new \"information\"; these are just different ways of saying that the \"a priori\" entropy of the poll results is large. Now, consider the case that the same poll is performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first poll is already known, the outcome of the second poll can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the \"a priori\" entropy of the second poll result is small relative to that of the first."], "wikipedia-201718": ["The principle of maximum entropy states that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy, in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a proposition that expresses testable information).\nAnother way of stating this: Take precisely stated prior data or testable information about a probability distribution function.

Yes  \n2. The relationship between entropy calculations and \"highest expected information\" can be explained using Wikipedia's content on **Entropy (Information Theory)**. Entropy quantifies the uncertainty or unpredictability of a system. Higher entropy corresponds to greater uncertainty, meaning a message or event with high entropy carries more \"information\" when it occurs (since it was less predictable). Thus, entropy calculations identify scenarios with the highest expected information by measuring which distributions maximize uncertainty (e.g., uniform distributions). Wikipedia covers this concept in the context of Shannon's work and information gain.", "wikipedia-15445": ["The measure of information entropy associated with each possible data value is the negative logarithm of the probability mass function for the value: \nWhen the data source produces a low-probability value (i.e., when a low-probability event occurs), the event carries more \"information\" (\"surprisal\") than when the source data produces a high-probability value. The amount of information conveyed by each event defined in this way becomes a random variable whose expected value is the information entropy. Generally, \"entropy\" refers to disorder or uncertainty, and the definition of entropy used in information theory is directly analogous to the definition used in statistical thermodynamics. The concept of information entropy was introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\".\n\nThe basic idea of information theory is that the \"news value\" of a communicated message depends on the degree to which the content of the message is surprising. If an event is very probable, it is no surprise (and generally uninteresting) when that event happens as expected. However, if an event is unlikely to occur, it is much more informative to learn that the event happened or will happen. For instance, the knowledge that some particular number \"will not\" be the winning number of a lottery provides very little information, because any particular chosen number will almost certainly not win. However, knowledge that a particular number \"will\" win a lottery has high value because it communicates the outcome of a very low probability event. The information content (also called the \"surprisal\") of an event formula_2 is an increasing function of the reciprocal of the probability formula_3 of the event, precisely formula_4. Entropy measures the expected (i.e., average) amount of information conveyed by identifying the outcome of a random trial. This implies that casting a die has higher entropy than tossing a coin because each outcome of a die toss has smaller probability (about formula_5) than each outcome of a coin toss (formula_6).\n\nEntropy is a measure of the \"unpredictability\" of the state, or equivalently, of its \"average information content\". To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the poll is not already known. In other words, the outcome of the poll is relatively \"unpredictable\", and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new \"information\"; these are just different ways of saying that the \"a priori\" entropy of the poll results is large. Now, consider the case that the same poll is performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first poll is already known, the outcome of the second poll can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the \"a priori\" entropy of the second poll result is small relative to that of the first.", "The entropy of the unknown result of the next toss of the coin is maximized if the coin is fair (that is, if heads and tails both have equal probability 1/2).

At the other extreme, if formula_2 is a deterministic function of formula_3 and formula_3 is a deterministic function of formula_2 then all information conveyed by formula_2 is shared with formula_3: knowing formula_2 determines the value of formula_3 and vice versa. As a result, in this case the mutual information is the same as the uncertainty contained in formula_3 (or formula_2) alone, namely the entropy of formula_3 (or formula_2).

This could include recommendations for restaurants, museums, or other points of interest or events near the user's location.\nThese services take advantage of the increasing use of smartphones that store and provide the location information of their users alongside location-based social networks (LBSN), like Foursquare, Gowalla, Swarm, and Yelp. In addition to geosocial networking services, traditional online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are using the location information of their users to show and recommend upcoming events, posts, and local trends.\nIn addition to its value for users, this information is valuable for third-party companies to advertise products, hotels, places, and to forecast service demand such as the number of taxis needed in a part of a city.\nSection::::Background.\nRecommender systems are information filtering systems which attempt to predict the rating or preference that a user would give, based on ratings that similar users gave and ratings that the user gave on previous occasions. These systems have become increasingly popular and are used for movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general.\nSection::::Recommending new places.\nThe main objective of recommending new places is to provide a suggestion to a user to visit unvisited places like restaurants, museums, national parks or other points of interest. This type of recommendation is quite valuable, especially for those who are traveling to a new city and want the best experience during their trip. Location-based social networks or third-party advertising companies are willing to provide a recommendation not only based on previous check-ins and preferences but also using social links to suggest a not-visited point-of-interest. The implicit goal of this type of recommendation is to lift the user's burden of searching for an interesting place.\nOne of the first studies in this area was conducted in 2011. The idea behind this work was to leverage social influence and location influence and provide recommendations. The authors provide three types of scores:\nBULLET::::- Similar users: this score is proportional to the similarity in behavior of users for visiting places. Mathematically, the similarity score between two users is computed as follows:formula_1Where formula_2 denotes the probability of visiting place formula_3 by user formula_4. This value could be computed based on the idea of user-based collaborative filtering as below:formula_5\nBULLET::::- Similar friends: this score is calculated by the cosine similarity of users based on their mutual connections (i.e.: friendships) in social media. This similarity is proportional to the number of friends that two users have in common. It is calculated as:formula_6Where formula_7represent the set of friends and formula_8is the place set of user formula_4 (i.e.: places the user visited). The tuning parameter formula_10, which is between 0 and 1, controls importance of social similarity and visiting similarity of two users.\nBULLET::::- Geographical distance: This score is inversely proportional to the distance between the target place and the typical places that a user frequently visits. Other studies have shown that overall distribution of distances is similar to power-law distribution. The formula below calculates the probability of check-in for user formula_4 in place formula_3 according to its distance from all check-ins of user formula_4.formula_14\nThe aggregate of these three scores is defined as:formula_15Where the three terms correspond to recommender systems based on user preference, social influence and geographical influence, respectively. The two weighting parameters formula_16 and formula_17 formula_18 denote the relative importance of social influence and geographical influence compared to user preference."], "wikipedia-14901108": ["The 1997 UNESCO Recommendation Concerning the Status of Higher Education Teaching Personnel is the international instrument that sets out the norms and standards for educators working in universities and institutions of higher education. The Recommendation is the only international instrument setting out norms and standards that deals exclusively with educators within universities and institutions of higher education, and as such it is of unique importance.\n\nThe formulation process for the Recommendation involved extensive consultation with experts and member states of UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization). As the Recommendation concerned employment conditions, there was also extensive consultation with the ILO (International Labor Organization). The Recommendation was adopted by unanimous vote of the General Conference of UNESCO, on 11 November 1997.\n\nIn UNESCO usage, a recommendation is a formal international instrument accepted by the member states of UNESCO (UNESCO, 1981). As is generally the case with international instruments, the Recommendation is soft law, that is, the enforcement of the norms and standards within the Recommendation is through the force of moral persuasion. There is, however, potential for individual governments to translate the Recommendation into hard law, through individual legislation.\n\nThe rationale for the Recommendation, as expressed in the Preamble, is that higher education plays a crucial role in both developed and developing societies. It is therefore of social importance to have specific norms and standards regarding employment and pay conditions for educators working within the higher education sector."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-1305558": 1, "wikipedia-165298": 1, "wikipedia-53910445": 1, "wikipedia-7129127": 1, "wikipedia-14901108": 1, "wikipedia-16398065": 1, "wikipedia-10449471": 1, "wikipedia-22358709": 1, "wikipedia-22705769": 1, "wikipedia-14850094": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-1305558": 2, "wikipedia-165298": 2, "wikipedia-53910445": 2, "wikipedia-7129127": 1, "wikipedia-14901108": 2, "wikipedia-16398065": 1, "wikipedia-10449471": 1, "wikipedia-22358709": 1, "wikipedia-22705769": 1, "wikipedia-14850094": 1}}}

It is closely related to the number of microscopic configurations (known as microstates) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy formula_1 is the natural logarithm of the number of microstates, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant . Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates), Macroscopic systems typically have a very large number of possible microscopic configurations. For example, the entropy of an ideal gas is proportional to the number of gas molecules . The number of molecules in twenty liters of gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is roughly (the Avogadro number). At equilibrium, each of the configurations can be regarded as random and equally likely. Because it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of the lack of information about it. The concept of entropy plays a central role in information theory."], "wikipedia-4701125": ["In Boltzmann's definition, entropy is a measure of the number of possible microscopic states (or microstates) of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, consistent with its macroscopic thermodynamic properties (or macrostate). To understand what microstates and macrostates are, consider the example of a gas in a container. At a microscopic level, the gas consists of a vast number of freely moving atoms, which occasionally collide with one another and with the walls of the container. The microstate of the system is a description of the positions and momenta of all the atoms. In principle, all the physical properties of the system are determined by its microstate. However, because the number of atoms is so large, the details of the motion of individual atoms is mostly irrelevant to the behavior of the system as a whole. Provided the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium, the system can be adequately described by a handful of macroscopic quantities, called \"thermodynamic variables\": the total energy \"E\", volume \"V\", pressure \"P\", temperature \"T\", and so forth. The macrostate of the system is a description of its thermodynamic variables.\n\nThere are three important points to note. Firstly, to specify any one microstate, we need to write down an impractically long list of numbers, whereas specifying a macrostate requires only a few numbers (\"E\", \"V\", etc.). However, and this is the second point, the usual thermodynamic equations only describe the macrostate of a system adequately when this system is in equilibrium; non-equilibrium situations can generally \"not\" be described by a small number of variables. As a simple example, consider adding a drop of food coloring to a glass of water. The food coloring diffuses in a complicated manner, which is in practice very difficult to precisely predict. However, after sufficient time has passed the system will reach a uniform color, which is much less complicated to describe. Actually, the macroscopic state of the system will be described by a small number of variables only if the system is at global thermodynamic equilibrium. Thirdly, more than one microstate can correspond to a single macrostate. In fact, for any given macrostate, there will be a huge number of microstates that are consistent with the given values of \"E\", \"V\", etc.\n\nWe are now ready to provide a definition of entropy. The entropy \"S\" is defined as\nwhere\nThe statistical entropy reduces to Boltzmann's entropy when all the accessible microstates of the system are equally likely. It is also the configuration corresponding to the maximum of a system's entropy for a given set of accessible microstates, in other words the macroscopic configuration in which the lack of information is maximal. As such, according to the second law of thermodynamics, it is the equilibrium configuration of an isolated system. Boltzmann's entropy is the expression of entropy at thermodynamic equilibrium in the microcanonical ensemble.\n\nThis postulate, which is known as Boltzmann's principle, may be regarded as the foundation of statistical mechanics, which describes thermodynamic systems using the statistical behavior of its constituents. It turns out that \"S\" is itself a thermodynamic property, just like \"E\" or \"V\". Therefore, it acts as a link between the microscopic world and the macroscopic.

As a unit of information, the bit has also been called a \"shannon\", named after Claude Shannon.\nAs a binary digit, the bit represents a logical value, having only one of two values. It may be physically implemented with a two-state device. These state values are most commonly represented as either , but other representations such as \"true/false\", \"yes/no\", \"+/\u2212\", or \"on/off\" are possible.

For information technology applications, the amount of information being processed is an important design consideration. The term bit-length is technical shorthand for this measure.\nFor example, computer processors are often designed to process data grouped into words of a given length of bits (8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit, 64 bit, etc.).

However, without specific context, the response would be broad.", "wikipedia-2958346": ["Spelling suggestion is a feature of many computer software applications used to suggest plausible replacements for words that are likely to have been misspelled. \"Spelling suggestion\" features are commonly included in Internet search engines, word processors, spell checkers, medical transcription, automatic query reformulation, and frequency-log statistics reporting.\n\nAny spell checker must have some data about the words in the target language, either in general usage or with specialized knowledge (like medical vocabulary). This can come from:\n- A dictionary of all known words.\n- A text corpus which includes typical text, known to be correctly spelled.\n- A list of frequently misspelled words, mapping errors to corrections.\n- Logs of human text input, such as from a popular search engine. This is essentially a crowdsourced corpus, but it is assumed there will be some spelling mistakes. Data might be included about when people click on a spelling suggestion or make a second, very similar query; this creates a crowdsourced mapping of misspelled words to reliable corrections.\n\nTo make use of a dictionary without a pre-existing mapping from misspellings to corrections, the typical technique is to calculate the edit distance between an input word and any given word in the dictionary. The Levenshtein distance metric considers an \"edit\" to be the insertion, deletion, or substitution (with another letter) of one letter. The Damerau\u2013Levenshtein distance adds transpositions (the swapping of neighboring letters). Dictionary words that are an edit distance of 1 away from the input word are considered highly likely as corrections, edit distance 2 less likely, and edit distance 3 sometimes included in suggestions and sometimes ignored.\n\nA text corpus can be summed up as a dictionary of known words, with a frequency of appearance for each word. This can be used to sort the spelling suggestions. For example, if there are multiple suggestions of edit distance 1, the words that appear most frequently in the corpus are most likely to be the desired correction.\n\nBecause a dictionary of known words is very large, calculating the edit distance between an input word and every word in the dictionary is computationally intensive and thus relatively slow. Various data structures can be utilized to speed up storage lookups, such as BK-trees. A faster approach adopted by Peter Norvig generates all the permutations from an input word of all possible edits. For a word of length \"n\" and an alphabet of size \"a\", for edit distance 1 there are at most \"n\" deletions, \"n-1\" transpositions, \"a*n\" alterations, and \"a*(n+1)\" insertions. Using only the 26 letters in the English alphabet, this would produce only \"54*n+25\" dictionary lookups, minus any duplicates (which depends on the specific letters in the word). This is relatively small when compared to a dictionary of hundreds of thousands of words. However, tens or hundreds of thousands of lookups might be required for edit distance 2 and greater. A further innovation adopted by Wolf Garbe, known as SymSpell (\"sym\" as in \"symmetry\") speeds the input-time calculation by utilizing the fact that only permutations involving deletions need to be generated for input words if the same deletion permutations are per-calculated on the dictionary.\n\nThe algorithms described so far do not deal well with correct words that are not in the dictionary. Common sources of unknown words in English are compound words and inflections, such as \"-s\" and \"-ing\". These can be accommodated algorithmically, especially if the dictionary contains the part of speech.\n\nThese algorithms have also assumed that all errors of a given distance are equally probable, which is not true. Errors that involve spelling phonetically where English orthography is not phonetic are common, as are errors that repeat the same letter or confuse neighboring letters on a QWERTY keyboard. If a large set of known spelling errors and corrections is available, this data can be used to generate frequency tables for letter pairs and edit types; these can be used to more accurately rank suggestions. It is also more common than chance for a word to be spelled in the wrong dialect compared to the rest of the text, for example due to American and British English spelling differences.\n\nSpelling suggestions can also be made more accurate by taking into account more than one word at a time. Multi-word sequences are known as n-grams (where \"n\" is the number of words in the sequence). A very large database of n-grams up to 5 words in length is available from Google for this and other purposes.\n\nOthers have experimented with using large amounts of data and deep learning techniques (a form of machine learning to train neural networks to perform spelling correction."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Data might be included about when people click on a spelling suggestion or make a second, very similar query; this creates a crowdsourced mapping of misspelled words to reliable corrections.\nA list of frequently misspelled words, possibly including multi-word phrases, can simply be consulted to see if any of the input words or phrases are listed.\nTo make use of a dictionary without a pre-existing mapping from misspellings to corrections, the typical technique is to calculate the edit distance between an input word and any given word in the dictionary. The Levenshtein distance metric considers an \"edit\" to be the insertion, deletion, or substitution (with another letter) of one letter. The Damerau\u2013Levenshtein distance adds transpositions (the swapping of neighboring letters). Dictionary words that are an edit distance of 1 away from the input word are considered highly likely as corrections, edit distance 2 less likely, and edit distance 3 sometimes included in suggestions and sometimes ignored.\nA text corpus can be summed up as a dictionary of known words, with a frequency of appearance for each word. This can be used to sort the spelling suggestions. For example, if there are multiple suggestions of edit distance 1, the words that appear most frequently in the corpus are most likely to be the desired correction.\nBecause a dictionary of known words is very large, calculating the edit distance between an input word and every word in the dictionary is computationally intensive and thus relatively slow. Various data structures can be utilized to speed up storage lookups, such as BK-trees. A faster approach adopted by Peter Norvig generates all the permutations from an input word of all possible edits. For a word of length \"n\" and an alphabet of size \"a\", for edit distance 1 there are at most \"n\" deletions, \"n-1\" transpositions, \"a*n\" alterations, and \"a*(n+1)\" insertions. Using only the 26 letters in the English alphabet, this would produce only \"54*n+25\" dictionary lookups, minus any duplicates (which depends on the specific letters in the word). This is relatively small when compared to a dictionary of hundreds of thousands of words. However, tens or hundreds of thousands of lookups might be required for edit distance 2 and greater. A further innovation adopted by Wolf Garbe, known as SymSpell (\"sym\" as in \"symmetry\") speeds the input-time calculation by utilizing the fact that only permutations involving deletions need to be generated for input words if the same deletion permutations are per-calculated on the dictionary.\nThe algorithms described so far do not deal well with correct words that are not in the dictionary. Common sources of unknown words in English are compound words and inflections, such as \"-s\" and \"-ing\". These can be accommodated algorithmically, especially if the dictionary contains the part of speech.\nThese algorithms have also assumed that all errors of a given distance are equally probable, which is not true. Errors that involve spelling phonetically where English orthography is not phonetic are common, as are errors that repeat the same letter or confuse neighboring letters on a QWERTY keyboard. If a large set of known spelling errors and corrections is available, this data can be used to generate frequency tables for letter pairs and edit types; these can be used to more accurately rank suggestions. It is also more common than chance for a word to be spelled in the wrong dialect compared to the rest of the text, for example due to American and British English spelling differences.\nSpelling suggestions can also be made more accurate by taking into account more than one word at a time. Multi-word sequences are known as n-grams (where \"n\" is the number of words in the sequence). A very large database of n-grams up to 5 words in length is available from Google for this and other purposes.\nOthers have experimented with using large amounts of data and deep learning techniques (a form of machine learning to train neural networks to perform spelling correction."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-2481523": 1, "wikipedia-3819245": 1, "wikipedia-8714167": 1, "wikipedia-23532232": 1, "wikipedia-38860223": 1, "wikipedia-2958346": 2, "wikipedia-19442735": 1, "wikipedia-1630299": 1, "wikipedia-3665312": 1, "wikipedia-8510553": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-2481523": 2, "wikipedia-3819245": 1, "wikipedia-8714167": 2, "wikipedia-23532232": 1, "wikipedia-38860223": 1, "wikipedia-2958346": 3, "wikipedia-19442735": 1, "wikipedia-1630299": 1, "wikipedia-3665312": 1, "wikipedia-8510553": 1}}}

To all of the questions that the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.\n\nThe question Searle wants to answer is this: does the machine \"literally\" \"understand\" Chinese?

It has some connections with Wald's maximin model; some authors distinguish them, others consider them instances of the same principle.\nIt has been developed since the 1980s by Yakov Ben-Haim, and has found many applications and described as a theory for decision-making under \"severe\" uncertainty\". It has been criticized as unsuited for this purpose, and alternatives proposed, including such classical approaches as robust optimization.\n\nInfo-gap is a decision theory: it seeks to assist in decision-making under uncertainty. It does this by using 3 models, each of which builds on the last. One begins with a \"model\" for the situation, where some \"parameter\" or parameters are unknown.\nOne then takes an \"estimate\" for the parameter, which is assumed to be \"substantially wrong,\" and one analyzes how \"sensitive\" the \"outcomes\" under the model are to the error in this estimate.\nBULLET::::- Uncertainty model: Starting from the estimate, an uncertainty model measures how distant other values of the parameter are from the estimate: as uncertainty increases, the set of possible values increase \u2013 if one is \"this\" uncertain in the estimate, what other parameters are possible?\nBULLET::::- Robustness/opportuneness model: Given an uncertainty model and a minimum level of desired outcome, then for each decision, how uncertain can you be and be assured achieving this minimum level? (This is called the robustness of the decision.) Conversely, given a desired windfall outcome, how uncertain must you be for this desirable outcome to be possible? (This is called the opportuneness of the decision.)\nBULLET::::- Decision-making model: To decide, one optimizes either the robustness or the opportuneness, on the basis of the robustness or opportuneness model. Given a desired minimum outcome, which decision is most robust (can stand the most uncertainty) and still give the desired outcome (the robust-satisficing action)? Alternatively, given a desired windfall outcome, which decision requires the \"least\" uncertainty for the outcome to be achievable (the opportune-windfalling action)?", "Info-gap was designed expressly as a methodology for solving decision problems that are subject to severe uncertainty. And what is more, its aim is to seek solutions that are robust.\n\nInfo-gap decision theory employs three simple constructs to capture the uncertainty associated with decision problems:\nBULLET::::1. A parameter formula_135 whose true value is subject to severe uncertainty.\nBULLET::::2. A region of uncertainty formula_156 where the true value of formula_157 lies.\nBULLET::::3. An estimate formula_158 of the true value of formula_157.\n\n\"Working Assumptions\"\nBULLET::::1. The region of uncertainty formula_156 is relatively large.br In fact, Ben-Haim (2006, p. 210) indicates that in the context of info-gap decision theory most of the commonly encountered regions of uncertainty are unbounded.\nBULLET::::2. The estimate formula_161 is a poor approximation of the true value of formula_162.br That is, the estimate is a poor indication of the true value of formula_162 (Ben-Haim, 2006, p. 280) and is likely to be substantially wrong (Ben-Haim, 2006, p. 281).\n\nIn the framework of classical decision theory, info-gap's robustness model can be construed as an instance of Wald's Maximin model and its opportuneness model is an instance of the classical Minimin model. Both operate in the neighborhood of an estimate of the parameter of interest whose true value is subject to \"severe\" uncertainty and therefore is likely to be \"substantially wrong\".", "Info-gap is propounded (e.g. Ben-Haim 2001, 2006) as a new non-probabilistic theory that is radically different from all current decision theories for decision under uncertainty. So, it is imperative to examine in this discussion in what way, if any, is info-gap's robustness model radically different from Maximin. For one thing, there is a well-established assessment of the utility of Maximin. For example, Berger (Chapter 5) suggests that even in situations where no prior information is available (a best case for Maximin), Maximin can lead to bad decision rules and be hard to implement. He recommends Bayesian methodology.

This is because\nHowever, if we know the coin is not fair, but comes up heads or tails with probabilities and , where , then there is less uncertainty.

The extreme case is that of a double-headed coin that never comes up tails, or a double-tailed coin that never results in a head. Then there is no uncertainty. The entropy is zero: each toss of the coin delivers no new information as the outcome of each coin toss is always certain.\nEntropy can be normalized by dividing it by information length.

It includes mathematical definitions, intuitive explanations, and examples that relate entropy to probability distributions. However, the explanation might require some simplification or additional context for complete accessibility to all audiences.", "wikipedia-9891": ["In statistical mechanics, entropy is an extensive property of a thermodynamic system. It is closely related to the number of microscopic configurations (known as microstates) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy formula_1 is the natural logarithm of the number of microstates, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant . Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates), Macroscopic systems typically have a very large number of possible microscopic configurations. For example, the entropy of an ideal gas is proportional to the number of gas molecules . The number of molecules in twenty liters of gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is roughly (the Avogadro number). At equilibrium, each of the configurations can be regarded as random and equally likely. The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Such systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy increases. Entropy is a function of the state of the system, so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is reversible, the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy. Because it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of the lack of information about it. The concept of entropy plays a central role in information theory.", "Clausius called this state function \"entropy\". One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nThe interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics is the measure of uncertainty, or \"mixedupness\" in the phrase of Gibbs, which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible microstates. In contrast to the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways in which a system may be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder). This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) which could give rise to the observed macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the Boltzmann constant.", "Entropy arises directly from the Carnot cycle. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\nIn a thermodynamic system, pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the equilibrium state has higher probability (more possible combinations of microstates) than any other state.\nAs an example, for a glass of ice water in air at room temperature, the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the thermal energy from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an isolated system such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the thermodynamic system is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved state function that is of great importance in the sciences of physics and chemistry. Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their time reversals (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy. For isolated systems, entropy never decreases. This fact has several important consequences in science: first, it prohibits \"perpetual motion\" machines; and second, it implies the arrow of entropy has the same direction as the arrow of time. Increases in entropy correspond to irreversible changes in a system, because some energy is expended as waste heat, limiting the amount of work a system can do.\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine. A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.", "BULLET::::- a measure of energy dispersal at a specific temperature.\nBULLET::::- a measure of disorder in the universe or of the availability of the energy in a system to do work.\nBULLET::::- a measure of a system's thermal energy per unit temperature that is unavailable for doing useful work.\nIn Boltzmann's definition, entropy is a measure of the number of possible microscopic states (or microstates) of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Consistent with the Boltzmann definition, the second law of thermodynamics needs to be re-worded as such that entropy increases over time, though the underlying principle remains the same.", "In information theory, \"entropy\" is the measure of the amount of information that is missing before reception and is sometimes referred to as \"Shannon entropy\". Shannon entropy is a broad and general concept which finds applications in information theory as well as thermodynamics. It was originally devised by Claude Shannon in 1948 to study the amount of information in a transmitted message. The definition of the information entropy is, however, quite general, and is expressed in terms of a discrete set of probabilities \"p so that\nIn the case of transmitted messages, these probabilities were the probabilities that a particular message was actually transmitted, and the entropy of the message system was a measure of the average amount of information in a message. For the case of equal probabilities (i.e. each message is equally probable), the Shannon entropy (in bits) is just the number of yes/no questions needed to determine the content of the message.\nThe expressions for the two entropies are similar. If \"W\" is the number of microstates that can yield a given macrostate, and each microstate has the same \"a priori\" probability, then that probability is . The Shannon entropy (in nats) is:\nand if entropy is measured in units of \"k\" per nat, then the entropy is given by:\nwhich is the famous Boltzmann entropy formula when \"k\" is Boltzmann's constant, which may be interpreted as the thermodynamic entropy per nat. There are many ways of demonstrating the equivalence of \"information entropy\" and \"physics entropy\", that is, the equivalence of \"Shannon entropy\" and \"Boltzmann entropy\"."], "wikipedia-1813193": ["If \"X\" is a discrete random variable with distribution given by\nthen the entropy of \"X\" is defined as\nIf \"X\" is a continuous random variable with probability density \"p\"(\"x\"), then the differential entropy of \"X\" is defined as\nThe quantity is understood to be zero whenever .\nThis is a special case of more general forms described in the articles Entropy (information theory), Principle of maximum entropy, and differential entropy. In connection with maximum entropy distributions, this is the only one needed, because maximizing formula_4 will also maximize the more general forms.\nThe base of the logarithm is not important as long as the same one is used consistently: change of base merely results in a rescaling of the entropy. Information theorists may prefer to use base 2 in order to express the entropy in bits; mathematicians and physicists will often prefer the natural logarithm, resulting in a unit of nats for the entropy."], "wikipedia-15445": ["Information entropy is the average rate at which information is produced by a stochastic source of data.\nThe measure of information entropy associated with each possible data value is the negative logarithm of the probability mass function for the value: \nWhen the data source produces a low-probability value (i.e., when a low-probability event occurs), the event carries more \"information\" (\"surprisal\") than when the source data produces a high-probability value. The amount of information conveyed by each event defined in this way becomes a random variable whose expected value is the information entropy. Generally, \"entropy\" refers to disorder or uncertainty, and the definition of entropy used in information theory is directly analogous to the definition used in statistical thermodynamics. The concept of information entropy was introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\".\nThe logarithm of the probability distribution is useful as a measure of entropy because it is additive for independent sources. For instance, the entropy of a fair coin toss is 1 bit, and the entropy of tosses is bits. In a straightforward representation, bits are needed to represent a variable that can take one of values if is a power of 2. If these values are equally probable, the entropy (in bits) is equal to . If one of the values is more probable to occur than the others, an observation that this value occurs is less informative than if some less common outcome had occurred. Conversely, rarer events provide more information when observed. Since observation of less probable events occurs more rarely, the net effect is that the entropy (thought of as average information) received from non-uniformly distributed data is always less than or equal to . Entropy is zero when one outcome is certain to occur. The entropy quantifies these considerations when a probability distribution of the source data is known. The \"meaning\" of the events observed (the meaning of \"messages\") does not matter in the definition of entropy. Entropy only takes into account the probability of observing a specific event, so the information it encapsulates is information about the underlying probability distribution, not the meaning of the events themselves.", "Named after Boltzmann's \u0397-theorem, Shannon defined the entropy (Greek capital letter eta) of a discrete random variable formula_10 with possible values formula_11 and probability mass function formula_12 as:\nHere formula_14 is the expected value operator, and is the information content of .\nformula_15 is itself a random variable.\nThe entropy can explicitly be written as\nwhere is the base of the logarithm used.

This is the situation of maximum uncertainty as it is most difficult to predict the outcome of the next toss; the result of each toss of the coin delivers one full bit of information. This is because\nHowever, if we know the coin is not fair, but comes up heads or tails with probabilities and , where , then there is less uncertainty. Every time it is tossed, one side is more likely to come up than the other. The reduced uncertainty is quantified in a lower entropy: on average each toss of the coin delivers less than one full bit of information. For example, if =0.7, then\nUniform probability yields maximum uncertainty and therefore maximum entropy. Entropy, then, can only decrease from the value associated with uniform probability.

Research suggests that if elaborative processing is behind self-referential encoding, a self-referential task should have the same effect as an elaborative task, whereas if organizational processing underlies the self-reference effect self-referential encoding tasks should function like organizational tasks. To test this, Klein and Loftus ran a 3x2 study testing organizational, elaborative and self-referential encoding with lists of 30 related or unrelated words. When participants were asked to memorize the unrelated list, recall and clustering were higher for the organizational task, which produced almost equal results to the self-referential task, suggesting that has an organizational basis.

The unit of the measurement depends on the base of the logarithm that is used to define the entropy.\nThe basic idea of information theory is that the \"news value\" of a communicated message depends on the degree to which the content of the message is surprising. If an event is very probable, it is no surprise (and generally uninteresting) when that event happens as expected.

It states that joint probability of independent sources of information communicates as much information as the two individual events separately. Particularly, if the first event can yield one of equiprobable outcomes and another has one of equiprobable outcomes then there are possible outcomes of the joint event.

The definition of the information entropy is, however, quite general, and is expressed in terms of a discrete set of probabilities \"p so that\nIn the case of transmitted messages, these probabilities were the probabilities that a particular message was actually transmitted, and the entropy of the message system was a measure of the average amount of information in a message. For the case of equal probabilities (i.e. each message is equally probable), the Shannon entropy (in bits) is just the number of yes/no questions needed to determine the content of the message."], "wikipedia-4699622": ["An analog to \"thermodynamic entropy\" is information entropy. In 1948, while working at Bell Telephone Laboratories, electrical engineer Claude Shannon set out to mathematically quantify the statistical nature of \"lost information\" in phone-line signals. To do this, Shannon developed the very general concept of information entropy, a fundamental cornerstone of information theory."], "wikipedia-3015758": ["Central to the MaxEnt thesis is the principle of maximum entropy. It demands as given some partly specified model and some specified data related to the model. It selects a preferred probability distribution to represent the model. The given data state \"testable information\" about the probability distribution, for example particular expectation values, but are not in themselves sufficient to uniquely determine it. The principle states that one should prefer the distribution which maximizes the Shannon information entropy,"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-15445": 3, "wikipedia-9891": 2, "wikipedia-4700845": 1, "wikipedia-7728392": 1, "wikipedia-46257389": 1, "wikipedia-4699622": 2, "wikipedia-3015758": 1, "wikipedia-361356": 1, "wikipedia-7319263": 1, "wikipedia-243627": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-15445": 3, "wikipedia-9891": 3, "wikipedia-4700845": 1, "wikipedia-7728392": 1, "wikipedia-46257389": 1, "wikipedia-4699622": 3, "wikipedia-3015758": 2, "wikipedia-361356": 1, "wikipedia-7319263": 1, "wikipedia-243627": 1}}}

Even though courses emphasised microstates and energy levels, most students could not get beyond simplistic notions of randomness or disorder. Many of those who learned by practising calculations did not understand well the intrinsic meanings of equations, and there was a need for qualitative explanations of thermodynamic relationships.\nThe energy dispersal approach has been criticised by Arieh Ben-Naim, who advocates abandoning the word entropy altogether, and replacing it with \"missing information\".\nSection::::Description.\nEntropy can be described in terms of \"energy dispersal\" and the \"spreading of energy,\" while avoiding all mention of \"disorder\" and \"chaos\" except when explaining misconceptions. All explanations of where and how energy is dispersing or spreading have been recast in terms of energy dispersal, so as to emphasise the underlying qualitative meaning.\nIn this approach, the second law of thermodynamics is introduced as \"Energy spontaneously disperses from being localized to becoming spread out if it is not hindered from doing so,\" often in the context of common experiences such as a rock falling, a hot frying pan cooling down, iron rusting, air leaving a punctured tyre and ice melting in a warm room. Entropy is then depicted as a sophisticated kind of \"before and after\" yardstick \u2014 measuring how much energy is spread out over time as a result of a process such as heating a system, or how widely spread out the energy is after something happens in comparison with its previous state, in a process such as gas expansion or fluids mixing (at a constant temperature). The equations are explored with reference to the common experiences, with emphasis that in chemistry the energy that entropy measures as dispersing is the internal energy of molecules.\nThe statistical interpretation is related to quantum mechanics in describing the way that energy is distributed (quantized) amongst molecules on specific energy levels, with all the energy of the macrostate always in only one microstate at one instant. Entropy is described as measuring the energy dispersal for a system by the number of accessible microstates, the number of different arrangements of all its energy at the next instant. Thus, an increase in entropy means a greater number of microstates for the final state than for the initial state, and hence more possible arrangements of a system's total energy at any one instant. Here, the greater 'dispersal of the total energy of a system' means the existence of many possibilities.\nContinuous movement and molecular collisions visualised as being like bouncing balls blown by air as used in a lottery can then lead on to showing the possibilities of many Boltzmann distributions and continually changing \"distribution of the instant\", and on to the idea that when the system changes, dynamic molecules will have a greater number of accessible microstates. In this approach, all everyday spontaneous physical happenings and chemical reactions are depicted as involving some type of energy flows from being localized or concentrated to becoming spread out to a larger space, always to a state with a greater number of microstates.\nThis approach provides a good basis for understanding the conventional approach, except in very complex cases where the qualitative relation of energy dispersal to entropy change can be so inextricably obscured that it is moot. Thus in situations such as the entropy of mixing when the two or more different substances being mixed are at the same temperature and pressure so there will be no net exchange of heat or work, the entropy increase will be due to the literal spreading out of the motional energy of each substance in the larger combined final volume. Each component\u2019s energetic molecules become more separated from one another than they would be in the pure state, when in the pure state they were colliding only with identical adjacent molecules, leading to an increase in its number of accessible microstates."], "wikipedia-7728392": ["However, there is a broad class of systems that manifest entropy-driven order, in which phases with organization or structural regularity, e.g. crystals, have higher entropy than structurally disordered (e.g. fluid) phases under the same thermodynamic conditions. In these systems phases that would be labeled as disordered by virtue of their higher entropy (in the sense of Clausius or Helmholtz) are ordered in both the everyday sense and in Landau theory."], "wikipedia-537539": ["The Theil index is an entropy measure. As for any resource distribution and with reference to information theory, \"maximum entropy\" occurs once income earners cannot be distinguished by their resources, i.e. when there is perfect equality. In real societies people can be distinguished by their different resources, with the resources being incomes. The more \"distinguishable\" they are, the lower is the \"actual entropy\" of a system consisting of income and income earners. Also based on information theory, the gap between these two entropies can be called \"redundancy\". It behaves like a negative entropy.\n\nFor the Theil index also the term \"Theil entropy\" had been used. This caused confusion. As an example, Amartya Sen commented on the Theil index, \"given the association of doom with entropy in the context of thermodynamics, it may take a little time to get used to entropy as a good thing.\" It is important to understand that an increasing Theil index \"does not\" indicate an increasing entropy, instead it indicates an increasing redundancy (decreasing entropy).\n\nHigh inequality yields high Theil redundancies. High redundancy means low entropy. But this does not necessarily imply that a very high inequality is \"good\", because very low entropies also can lead to explosive compensation processes.

This is essential in platonic, romantic, family and professional relationships because they all are ongoing and integral to one\u2019s overall satisfaction in life.\nPrinciples from two theoretical studies help justify why individuals conduct themselves in a particular fashion while shedding light on how they go about it. One is the \"Uncertainty Reduction Theory,\" that argues people look to gain information about others, reducing uncertainty, with hopes of establishing healthy relationship where the benefits outweigh the costs This theory was created by Charles Berger and Richard Calabrese to understand the communication process between strangers that connected to our expectations since people are naturally inquisitive, social beings.\nThe studies of Uncertainty Reduction Theory evolved from only pertaining to the interaction of strangers and the expectations associated, if any, to the realization that it was evident in most forms of human communication. It is human nature to want to belong to something bigger than yourself so it\u2019s no coincidence that people subconsciously are looking to bond with others when given the opportunity, especially with your preferred sex. Therefore, after someone\u2019s attention is captured in an initial greeting, people tend to look for subtle cues to see if the other party is willing to continue, often seen as being friendly and welcoming. Duck states the continuation of these initial interactions as \u201cunfinished business\u201d that will last until the relationship ceases. On the contrary, rejection could lead to frustration that eventually could make your insecurities even worse. The theory states the three strategies people go about seeking information is: (1) \"Passive\" \u2013 observing them in their natural environment. (2) \"Interactive\" \u2013 directly communicating with the person. (3) \"Active\" \u2013 reaching out to others for the information and determining if the next step should be observing them passively or interactively communicating with them. In the social media era we live, a study was done that revealed the passive strategy, is the most commonly used but the interactive strategy reduces the most uncertainty. Information gained from these strategies not only reduces uncertainty but also increase the likelihood of predicting the others\u2019 next course of action. The behavior associated with these strategies is known as \u201cself-monitoring\u201d, where people strategically manipulate how they present themselves due to the information they have received.\nAs studies developed there have been other uncertainties related to oneself, their partner, and the relationship that stem from these behaviors. During self-uncertainty an individual\u2019s insecurity makes one question and start trying to seek information about their own past behaviors and predict what they should act going forward. This can be independent or derived from partner-uncertainty, where people try to figure out what problems have occurred that justify the other individual\u2019s behavior or feelings so they can be a better help to them. The last form is a combination of the two known as relationship uncertainty. This occurs when the lack of information about the source of relational issues and causes a disturbance because one can\u2019t thoroughly explain and", "Uncertainty reduction theory comes from the sociopsychological perspective. It addresses the basic process of how we gain knowledge about other people. According to the theory, people have difficulty with uncertainty. They want to be able to predict behavior, and therefore, they are motivated to seek more information about people.\nThe theory argues that strangers, upon meeting, go through certain steps and checkpoints in order to reduce uncertainty about each other and form an idea of whether one likes or dislikes the other. As we communicate, we are making plans to accomplish our goals.\nAt highly uncertain moments, we become more vigilant and rely more on data available in the situation. When we are less certain, we lose confidence in our own plans and make contingency plans. The theory also says that higher levels of uncertainty create distance between people and that non-verbal expressiveness tends to help reduce uncertainty.\nConstructs include level of uncertainty, nature of the relationship and ways to reduce uncertainty. Underlying assumptions include that an individual will cognitively process the existence of uncertainty and take steps to reduce it. The boundary conditions for this theory are that there must be some kind of outside social situation trigger and internal cognitive process.\nAccording to the theory, we reduce uncertainty in three ways:\nBULLET::::1. Passive strategies: observing the person.\nBULLET::::2. Active strategies: asking others about the person or looking up info.\nBULLET::::3. Interactive strategies: asking questions, self-disclosure.\nUncertainty Reduction Theory is most applicable to the initial interaction context, and in response to this limited context, scholars have extended the uncertainty framework with theories that describe uncertainty manangement, more broadly, and motivated information management. These subsequent theories give a broader conceptualization of how uncertainty operates in interpersonal communication as well as how uncertainty motivates individuals to seek information."], "wikipedia-42130800": ["An important skill children need to learn is being able to identify when a message is incomplete and they don't have enough information to make an accurate interpretation. Being aware that an ambiguous situation has arisen is difficult for young children. Children accurately \"know when they know\", but often overestimate when they don't know. Children's behaviour does not seem to match their verbal ability to acknowledge their \"lack of knowledge\". Despite incorrectly stating that they \"know\" something, children are still capable of changing their response upon hearing contradicting information to an initial interpretation and/or event. Language plays an important role in children's accuracy in assessing their own knowledge. For children to accurately \"know what they know\" it is important for them to understand the various meanings of the word \"know\" as well as language used to describe certainty and uncertainty.", "Physical uncertainty occurs when an event has not yet happened, and therefore the outcome of that event has not been determined (i.e. the dice has not yet been rolled). Epistemic uncertainty occurs when an event has already occurred, but the child is not aware of the outcome of the event (i.e. the dice have been rolled, but the dice are hidden from the participant). 4 to 8 year old children have the ability to realize multiple possibilities for an event that has not yet occurred (\"physical uncertainty\"), however they do not seem to acknowledge that there are exactly the same possibilities for an event that has already happened when they don't know the outcome (\"epistemic uncertainty\"). Under the conditions of \"epistemic uncertainty\", children simply guess one of the possibilities. Beck and colleagues (2011) propose that this happens because it is much easier to imagine the outcome during epistemic uncertainty, basically knowing that there is only one outcome. Similarly, adults also prefer to make predictions or guess in epistemic uncertainty."], "wikipedia-18985062": ["The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence and is inversely proportional to that. The more uncertain an event, the more information is required to resolve uncertainty of that event. The bit is a typical unit of information, but other units such as the nat may be used. For example, the information encoded in one \"fair\" coin flip is log(2/1) = 1 bit, and in two fair coin flips is log(4/1) = 2 bits."], "wikipedia-2661638": ["Within the theory two types of uncertainty are identified; cognitive uncertainty and behavioral uncertainty. There are three types of strategies which people may use to seek information about someone: passive, active, and interactive. Furthermore, the initial interaction of strangers can be broken down into individual stages\u2014the entry stage, the personal stage, and the exit stage. According to the theory, people find uncertainty in interpersonal relationships unpleasant and are motivated to reduce it through interpersonal communication.\n\nCognitive uncertainty pertains to the level of uncertainty associated with the cognition (beliefs and attitudes) of each other in the situation. Uncertainty is high in initial interactions because individuals are not aware of the beliefs and attitude of the other party.\n\nBehavioral uncertainty pertains to \"the extent to which behavior is predictable in a given situation\". Uncertainty is one motivation behind adoption of norms in most societies in which people tend to abide by, and if in initial conversations one chooses to ignore such norms there are risks of increasing behavioral uncertainty and reducing the likelihood of having future interactions. A great example of ignoring societal norms is engaging in inappropriate self-disclosure.", "Based on the concept of uncertainty reduction theory, the hypothesis that people identify most strongly with groups if they felt self-conceptual uncertainty was tested. Results revealed that people who feel self-conceptual uncertainty are motivated to join groups in which they identify with as an efficient strategy and immediate way to reduce one's self-conceptual uncertainty. Hogg bases his argument on the premise that subjective uncertainty, especially those about one's self and identity are unpleasant and that people strive to reduce uncertainties they feel about themselves.\nA person's self-categorization is affected by group identification including nationality, religion, gender, ethnicity and many other associated groups. Thus people continue to try to reduce the uncertainties they feel about themselves by identifying with even more specific groups. There is also evidence that people who are highly uncertain about themselves are more likely to identify with more homogeneous groups to reduce their uncertainty of self and reach a more definite state. Generally, people will be able to reduce their self-uncertainty either significantly or to a low degree, depending on the type of group they join and to what extent one can relate to his or herself within a group.", "afrank, when we communicate we are attempting to predict certain outcome to maximize the relational outcomes. Kellerman and Reynolds (1990) pointed out that sometimes there are high level of uncertainty in interaction that no one wants to reduce. Their study find that the central determinant of both information seeking (axiom 3) and liking (axiom 4) is the predicted outcome values rather than reducing uncertainty.\n\nMRU suggests that different levels of motivation to reduce uncertainty can lead to certain communication behaviors depending on competing goals.\n\nMRU suggests at least four different reasons for low motivation to seek information:\nBULLET::::- People do not experience uncertainty in every event or encounter. Predictable or easily understood situations will not result in significant levels of uncertainty.\nBULLET::::- Individuals have different levels of tolerance for uncertainty. The more one tolerates uncertainty the less information one seeks.\nBULLET::::- Because communication always has social or effort costs, minimizing those costs with limited effort may be preferable to information seeking.\nBULLET::::- Individuals may also create certainty with minimal information seeking and without overt communication. For example, classification systems, such as stereotyping, create certainty out of uncertain situations.\n\nGudykunst's anxiety/uncertainty management theory (AUM) also differs from Berger's uncertainty reduction theory in several significant ways. First, AUM asserts that people do not always try to reduce uncertainty. When uncertainty allows people to maintain positive predicted outcome values, they may choose to manage their information intake such that they balance their level of uncertainty. Second, AUM claims that people experience uncertainty differently in different situations. People must evaluate whether a particular instance of uncertainty is stressful, and if so, what resources are available."], "wikipedia-11022357": ["Ambiguity arises when the probability or value of an object (i.e., situation, outcome, thing, etc.) is unclear or highly uncertain. Babrow explained, that \u201cin ambiguous situations, neither the outcome, nor the probability of the outcome is known, though the latter has restrictions\u201d (Babrow, 1992, p. 112). Uncertainty occurs when an unknown factor obscures or complicates the development of one's orientation (probability and evaluation) toward an outcome. Ambiguity has also been described as uncertainty about what is unknown."], "wikipedia-60459": ["Abductive conclusions are thus qualified as having a remnant of uncertainty or doubt, which is expressed in retreat terms such as \"best available\" or \"most likely\".

It is \"very little hampered\" by rules of logic. Even a well-prepared mind's individual guesses are more frequently wrong than right. But the success of our guesses far exceeds that of random luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instinct (some speak of intuition in such contexts).\nBULLET::::- Abduction guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a plausible, instinctive, economical way for a surprising or very complicated phenomenon. That is its proximate aim.\nBULLET::::- Its longer aim is to economize inquiry itself. Its rationale is inductive: it works often enough, is the only source of new ideas, and has no substitute in expediting the discovery of new truths.

The amount of information conveyed by each event defined in this way becomes a random variable whose expected value is the information entropy. Generally, \"entropy\" refers to disorder or uncertainty, and the definition of entropy used in information theory is directly analogous to the definition used in statistical thermodynamics.\nThe basic idea of information theory is that the \"news value\" of a communicated message depends on the degree to which the content of the message is surprising. If an event is very probable, it is no surprise (and generally uninteresting) when that event happens as expected. However, if an event is unlikely to occur, it is much more informative to learn that the event happened or will happen. For instance, the knowledge that some particular number \"will not\" be the winning number of a lottery provides very little information, because any particular chosen number will almost certainly not win. However, knowledge that a particular number \"will\" win a lottery has high value because it communicates the outcome of a very low probability event. The information content (also called the \"surprisal\") of an event formula_2 is an increasing function of the reciprocal of the probability formula_3 of the event, precisely formula_4. Entropy measures the expected (i.e., average) amount of information conveyed by identifying the outcome of a random trial. This implies that casting a die has higher entropy than tossing a coin because each outcome of a die toss has smaller probability (about formula_5) than each outcome of a coin toss (formula_6).\nEntropy is a measure of the \"unpredictability\" of the state, or equivalently, of its \"average information content\"."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

In practice, almost all histograms used in research or commercial products are of the Serial class, meaning that sequential sort values are placed in either the same bucket, or sequential buckets.

Since one bucket must end at the data point for 8, we must decide where to put the other bucket boundary.

As a result, the value in the counter represents the level of the water in the analogous bucket.

It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable (CORAL\n) and was first introduced by Karl Pearson. It differs from a bar graph, in the sense that a bar graph relates two variables, but a histogram relates only one. To construct a histogram, the first step is to \"bin\" (or \"bucket\") the range of values\u2014that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals\u2014and then count how many values fall into each interval. The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The bins (intervals) must be adjacent, and are often (but are not required to be) of equal size.\nIf the bins are of equal size, a rectangle is erected over the bin with height proportional to the frequency\u2014the number of cases in each bin. A histogram may also be normalized to display \"relative\" frequencies. It then shows the proportion of cases that fall into each of several categories, with the sum of the heights equaling 1.\nHowever, bins need not be of equal width; in that case, the erected rectangle is defined to have its \"area\" proportional to the frequency of cases in the bin. The vertical axis is then not the frequency but \"frequency density\"\u2014the number of cases per unit of the variable on the horizontal axis. Examples of variable bin width are displayed on Census bureau data below.\nAs the adjacent bins leave no gaps, the rectangles of a histogram touch each other to indicate that the original variable is continuous.\nHistograms give a rough sense of the density of the underlying distribution of the data, and often for density estimation: estimating the probability density function of the underlying variable. The total area of a histogram used for probability density is always normalized to 1. If the length of the intervals on the \"x\"-axis are all 1, then a histogram is identical to a relative frequency plot.\nA histogram can be thought of as a simplistic kernel density estimation, which uses a kernel to smooth frequencies over the bins. This yields a smoother probability density function, which will in general more accurately reflect distribution of the underlying variable. The density estimate could be plotted as an alternative to the histogram, and is usually drawn as a curve rather than a set of boxes. Histograms are nevertheless preferred in applications, when their statistical properties need to be modeled. The correlated variation of a kernel density estimate is very difficult to describe mathematically, while it is simple for a histogram where each bin varies independently.\nAn alternative to kernel density estimation is the average shifted histogram,\nwhich is fast to compute and gives a smooth curve estimate of the density without using kernels.\nThe histogram is one of the seven basic tools of quality control.\nHistograms are sometimes confused with bar charts. A histogram is used for continuous data, where the bins represent ranges of data, while a bar chart is a plot of categorical variables. Some authors recommend that bar charts have gaps between the rectangles to clarify the distinction."], "wikipedia-16693318": ["In a differential DVH, bar or column height indicates the volume of structure receiving a dose given by the bin. Bin doses are along the horizontal axis, and structure volumes (either percent or absolute volumes) are on the vertical. The differential DVH takes the appearance of a typical histogram. It reads like the volume of the organ that receives the dose of the correspondent dose - bin. It is built by the sum of the number of voxels characterized by a specified range of dosage for the organ considered. It is helpful in providing information about changes in dose within the structure considered and to easily visualize minimum and maximum dose.\nThe cumulative DVH is plotted with bin doses along the horizontal axis, as well. However, the column height of the first bin (0\u20131\u00a0Gy, e.g.) represents the volume of structure receiving greater than or equal to that dose. The column height of the second bin (1.001\u20132.000\u00a0Gy, e.g.) represents the volume of structure receiving greater than or equal to that dose, etc. With very fine (small) bin sizes, the cumulative DVH takes on the appearance of a smooth line graph. The lines always slope and start from top-left to bottom-right. For a structure receiving a very homogenous dose (100% of the volume receiving exactly 10\u00a0Gy, for example) the cumulative DVH will appear as a horizontal line at the top of the graph, at 100% volume as plotted vertically, with a vertical drop at 10 Gy on the horizontal axis. A DVH used clinically usually includes all structures and targets of interest in the radiotherapy plan, each line plotted a different color, representing a different structure. The vertical axis is almost always plotted as percent volume (rather than absolute volume), as well."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-4345916": 1, "wikipedia-2655175": 1, "wikipedia-11399877": 1, "wikipedia-25176819": 1, "wikipedia-35026656": 1, "wikipedia-8820778": 1, "wikipedia-16002932": 1, "wikipedia-505717": 1, "wikipedia-13266": 1, "wikipedia-16693318": 2}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-4345916": 1, "wikipedia-2655175": 2, "wikipedia-11399877": 1, "wikipedia-25176819": 1, "wikipedia-35026656": 2, "wikipedia-8820778": 1, "wikipedia-16002932": 1, "wikipedia-505717": 1, "wikipedia-13266": 2, "wikipedia-16693318": 3}}}

However, the lack of explicit context in the query might require further refinement to locate relevant information.", "wikipedia-1547308": ["Subjunctive possibilities include logical possibility, metaphysical possibility, nomological possibility, and temporal possibility.\n\nThere are several different types of subjunctive modality, which can be classified as broader or more narrow than one another depending on how restrictive the rules for what counts as \"possible\" are. Some of the most commonly discussed are:\nBULLET::::- Logical possibility is usually considered the broadest sort of possibility; a proposition is said to be logically possible if there is no logical contradiction involved in its being true. \"Dick Cheney is a bachelor\" is logically possible, though in fact false; most philosophers have thought that statements like \"If I flap my arms very hard, I will fly\" are \"logically\" possible, although they are \"nomologically\" impossible. \"Dick Cheney is a married bachelor,\" on the other hand, is \"logically impossible\"; anyone who is a bachelor is \"therefore\" not married, so this proposition is logically self-contradictory (though the sentence isn't, because it is logically possible for \"bachelor\" to mean \"married man\").\nBULLET::::- Metaphysical possibility is either equivalent to logical possibility or narrower than it (what a philosopher thinks the relationship between the two is depends, in part, on the philosopher's view of logic). Some philosophers have held that \"discovered identities\" such as Kripke's \"Water is HO\" are metaphysically necessary but not logically necessary (they would claim that there is no formal contradiction involved in \"Water is \"not\" HO\" even though it turns out to be metaphysically impossible). In reality though, water also contains HO and OH ions.\nBULLET::::- Nomological possibility is \"possibility under the actual laws of nature\". Most philosophers since David Hume have held that the laws of nature are \"metaphysically contingent\"\u2014that there could have been different natural laws than the ones that actually obtain. If so, then it would not be \"logically\" or \"metaphysically\" impossible, for example, for you to travel to Alpha Centauri in one day; it would just have to be the case that you could travel faster than the speed of light. But of course there is an important sense in which this is \"not\" possible; \"given\" that the laws of nature are what they are, there is no way that you could do it. (Some philosophers, such as Sydney Shoemaker , have argued that the laws of nature are in fact \"necessary\", not contingent; if so, then nomological possibility is equivalent to metaphysical possibility.)\nBULLET::::- Temporal possibility is \"possibility given the actual history of the world\". David Lewis \"could have\" chosen to take his degree in Accounting rather than Philosophy; but there is an important sense in which he \"cannot now\". The \"could have\" expresses the fact that there is no logical, metaphysical, or even nomological impossibility involved in Lewis's having a degree in Economics instead of Philosophy; the \"cannot now\" expresses the fact that that possibility is no longer open to becoming actual, given that the past is as it actually is.\nSimilarly David Lewis could have taken a degree in Economics but not in, say, Aviation (because it was not taught at Harvard) or Cognitive Neuroscience (because the so-called 'conceptual space' for such a major did not exist). There is some debate whether this final type of possibility in fact constitutes a type of possibility distinct from Temporal, and is sometimes called Historical Possibility by thinkers like Ian Hacking."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The certificate of deposit will earn $500 independent of the market's fluctuation.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the expected value of perfect information?\n\nSolution:\nHere the payoff matrix is:\nThe probability vector is:\nExpectation for each vehicle (formula_11):\nThe maximum of these expectations is the stock vehicle. Not knowing which direction the market will go (only knowing the probability of the directions), we expect to make the most money with the stock vehicle.\nThus,\nOn the other hand, consider if we did know ahead of time which way the market would turn. Given the knowledge of the direction of the market we would (potentially) make a different investment vehicle decision.\nExpectation for maximizing profit given the state of the market:\nThat is, given each market direction, we choose the investment vehicle that maximizes the profit.\nHence,\nConclusion:\nKnowing the direction the market will go (i.e. having perfect information) is worth $350.\nDiscussion:\nIf someone was selling information that guaranteed the accurate prediction of the future market direction, we would want to purchase this information only if the price was less than $350. If the price was greater than $350 we would not purchase the information, if the price was less than $350 we would purchase the information.

Studying patient safety and safety interventions in healthcare is challenging, because there is a lack of experimental control (i.e., patient complexity, system/process variances) to see if an intervention made a meaningful difference (Groves & Manges, 2017). An example of innovative simulation to study patient safety is from nursing research. Groves et al. (2016) used a high-fidelity simulation to examine nursing safety-oriented behaviors during times such as change-of-shift report.\n\nHowever, the value of simulation interventions to translating to clinical practice are is still debatable. As Nishisaki states, \"there is good evidence that simulation training improves provider and team self-efficacy and competence on manikins. There is also good evidence that procedural simulation improves actual operational performance in clinical settings.\" However, there is a need to have improved evidence to show that crew resource management training through simulation. One of the largest challenges is showing that team simulation improves team operational performance at the bedside. Although evidence that simulation-based training actually improves patient outcome has been slow to accrue, today the ability of simulation to provide hands-on experience that translates to the operating room is no longer in doubt.\n\nOne of the largest factors that might impact the ability to have training impact the work of practitioners at the bedside is the ability to empower frontline staff (Stewart, Manges, Ward, 2015). Another example of an attempt to improve patient safety through the use of simulations training is patient care to deliver just-in-time service or/and just-in-place. This training consists of 20 minutes of simulated training just before workers report to shift. One study found that just in time training improved the transition to the bedside. The conclusion as reported in Nishisaki (2008) work, was that the simulation training improved resident participation in real cases; but did not sacrifice the quality of service. It could be therefore hypothesized that by increasing the number of highly trained residents through the use of simulation training, that the simulation training does, in fact, increase patient safety.", "Simulation training has become a method for preparing people for disasters.

CADE has used a video game to prepare emergency workers for multiple types of attacks. As reported by News-Medical.Net, \"The video game is the first in a series of simulations to address bioterrorism, pandemic flu, smallpox, and other disasters that emergency personnel must prepare for.\" Developed by a team from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the game allows learners to practice their emergency skills in a safe, controlled environment.\n\nThe Emergency Simulation Program (ESP) at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT), Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is another example of an organization that uses simulation to train for emergency situations. ESP uses simulation to train on the following situations: forest fire fighting, oil or chemical spill response, earthquake response, law enforcement, municipal firefighting, hazardous material handling, military training, and response to terrorist attack One feature of the simulation system is the implementation of \"Dynamic Run-Time Clock,\" which allows simulations to run a 'simulated' time frame, \"'speeding up' or 'slowing down' time as desired\" Additionally, the system allows session recordings, picture-icon based navigation, file storage of individual simulations, multimedia components, and launch external applications.\n\nAt the University of Qu\u00e9bec in Chicoutimi, a research team at the outdoor research and expertise laboratory (Laboratoire d'Expertise et de Recherche en Plein Air \u2013 LERPA) specializes in using wilderness backcountry accident simulations to verify emergency response coordination.\n\nInstructionally, the benefits of emergency training through simulations are that learner performance can be tracked through the system. This allows the developer to make adjustments as necessary or alert the educator on topics that may require additional attention. Other advantages are that the learner can be guided or trained on how to respond appropriately before continuing to the next emergency segment\u2014this is an aspect that may not be available in the live environment. Some emergency training simulators also allow for immediate feedback, while other simulations may provide a summary and instruct the learner to engage in the learning topic again.\n\nIn a live-emergency situation, emergency responders do not have time to waste. Simulation-training in this environment provides an opportunity for learners to gather as much information as they can and practice their knowledge in a safe environment.

So there is a buildup of inventory. This inventory can be reduced by employing another machine occasionally. Thus we understand the reduction in local inventory buildup. But now this machine produces 150 parts in 10 hours which might not be processed by the next machine and thus we have just shifted the in-process inventory from one machine to another without having any impact on overall production\nSimulation is used to address some issues in manufacturing as follows: In workshop to see the ability of system to meet the requirement, To have optimal inventory to cover for machine failures."], "wikipedia-23145778": ["Configuring models to run in real time enables you to use hardware-in-the-loop simulation to test controllers.

The response has been to focus on too many measures on which to base performance assessment.

Then, organizations can assess performance based on the products that employees create. Finally, financial performance measures should be a focus to identify how employee achievements contribute to the business' profitability.", "When performance appraisal measures are run down, they typically need to be replaced by new measures. In the sciences, overlapping data is useful, in that it they can be used to confirm or disprove a given hypothesis. In management, however, overlapping measurements are considered redundant, rather than a useful indication of reliability. By the same token, new measures that lie in direct opposition to existing measures of performance are not helpful. For instance, if a retail company uses units of shoes sold in a month as a metric, adding units of shoes remaining unsold after a month as a new metric is not helpful. Since the company can derive the same information and draw the same conclusions from both metrics, it is more efficient to use only one of the two measures. In the interest of generating useful data, new performance measures should be orthogonal to existing metrics.\n\nOrthogonality, or non-redundancy, does not necessarily indicate null correlation. Consider a secretary's performance, which might be measured by number of breaks per hour and the time required to complete reports. The two measures are orthogonal because they do not overlap. However, it is possible that repeated evaluations could show a reliable association between a higher number of breaks per hour and less time required to complete reports.\n\nThe history of General Electric provides a clear example of developing orthogonal performance measures. When GE dismantled its conglomerate in the 1950s, its existing performance measures, which relied on centralized budgetary targets, needed to evolve to suit the newly decentralized company. The 1951 GE Measurement Project provided a template for the new performance measures, which were orthogonal to the old performance measures, as well as to each other. The new measures were \"profitability, market position, productivity, product leadership, personnel development, employee attitudes, public responsibility\", and balance between short-term and long-term goals. Thirty years later, when the company was in dire straits, the performance measurements were functionally consolidated into ranked profitability and growth. With this strategy, GE annually swept away the bottom 10% of its performers in profitability and growth. Once GE regained financial and market stability, the performance evaluation metrics changed in response, allegedly expanding and taking on more humanistic values. GE illustrates two important notes about changing performance metrics. First, new performance measures are most useful when they are unrelated to each other and to existing measures. Second, performance measures tend towards elaboration during times of security and profitability, and likewise tend towards consolidation during times of urgency and strain."], "wikipedia-9585793": ["Reuse metrics\nIn software engineering, many reuse metrics and models are metrics used to measure code reuse and reusability.

Such metrics are often split into kinds: online metrics look at users' interactions with the search system, while offline metrics measure relevance, in other words how likely each result, or search engine results page (SERP) page as a whole, is to meet the information needs of the user.\n\nSection::::Online metrics.\nOnline metrics are generally created from search logs. The metrics are often used to determine the success of an A/B test.\n\nSection::::Online metrics.:Session abandonment rate.\nSession abandonment rate is a ratio of search sessions which do not result in a click.\n\nSection::::Online metrics.:Click-through rate.\nClick-through rate (CTR) is the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. It is commonly used to measure the success of an online advertising campaign for a particular website as well as the effectiveness of email campaigns.\n\nSection::::Online metrics.:Session success rate.\nSession success rate measures the ratio of user sessions that lead to a success. Defining \"success\" is often dependent on context, but for search a successful result is often measured using dwell time as a primary factor along with secondary user interaction, for instance, the user copying the result URL is considered a successful result, as is copy/pasting from the snippet.\n\nSection::::Online metrics.:Zero result rate.\n\"Zero result rate\" (\"ZRR\") is the ratio of SERPs which returned with zero results. The metric either indicates a recall issue, or that the information being searched for is not in the index.\n\nSection::::Offline metrics.\nOffline metrics are generally created from relevance judgment sessions where the judges score the quality of the search results. Both binary (relevant/non-relevant) and multi-level (e.g., relevance from 0 to 5) scales can be used to score each document returned in response to a query. In practice, queries may be ill-posed, and there may be different shades of relevance. For instance, there is ambiguity in the query \"mars\": the judge does not know if the user is searching for the planet Mars, the Mars chocolate bar, or the singer Bruno Mars.\n\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Precision.\nPrecision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are relevant to the user's information need.\nIn binary classification, precision is analogous to positive predictive value. Precision takes all retrieved documents into account. It can also be evaluated at a given cut-off rank, considering only the topmost results returned by the system. This measure is called \"precision at n\" or \"P@n\".\n\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Recall.\nRecall is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved.\nIn binary classification, recall is often called sensitivity. So it can be looked at as \"the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query\".\nIt is trivial to achieve recall of 100% by returning all documents in response to any query. Therefore, recall alone is not enough but one needs to measure the number of non-relevant documents also, for example by computing the precision.\n\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Fall-out.\nThe proportion of non-relevant documents that are retrieved, out of all non-relevant documents available:\nIn binary classification, fall-out is closely related to specificity and is equal to formula_9. It can be looked at as \"the probability that a non-relevant document is retrieved by the query\".\nIt is trivial to achieve fall-out of 0% by returning zero documents in response to any query.\n\nSection::::Offline metrics.:F-score / F-measure.\nThe weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, the traditional F-measure or balanced F-score is:\nThis is also known as the formula_11 measure, because recall and precision are evenly weighted.\nThe general formula for non-negative real formula_12 is:\nTwo other commonly used F measures are the formula_14 measure, which weights recall twice as much as precision, and the formula_15 measure, which weights precision twice as much as recall.\nThe F-measure was derived by van Rijsbergen (1979) so that formula_16 \"measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches formula_12 times as much importance to recall as precision\". It is based on van Rijsbergen's effectiveness measure formula_18. Their relationship is:\nF-measure can be a better single metric when compared to precision and recall; both precision and recall give different information that can complement each other when combined. If one of them excels more than the other, F-measure will reflect it.\n\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Average precision.\nPrecision and recall are single-value metrics based on the whole list of documents returned by the system. For systems that return a ranked sequence of documents, it is desirable to also consider the order in which the returned documents are presented. By computing a precision and recall at every position in the ranked sequence of documents, one can plot a precision-recall curve, plotting precision formula_21 as a function of recall formula_22. Average precision computes the average value of formula_21 over the interval from formula_24 to formula_25:\nThat is the area under the precision-recall curve.\nThis integral is in practice replaced with a finite sum over every position in the ranked sequence of documents:\nwhere formula_28 is the rank in the sequence of retrieved documents, formula_29 is the number of retrieved documents, formula_30 is the precision at cut-off formula_28 in the list, and formula_32 is the change in recall from items formula_33 to formula_28.\nThis finite sum is equivalent to:\nwhere formula_36 is an indicator function equaling 1 if the item at rank formula_28 is a relevant document, zero otherwise. Note that the average is over all relevant documents and the relevant documents not retrieved get a precision score of zero.\nSome authors choose to interpolate the formula_21 function to reduce the impact of \"wiggles\" in the curve. For example, the PASCAL Visual Object Classes challenge (a benchmark for computer vision object detection) until 2010 computed the average precision by averaging the precision over a set of evenly spaced recall levels {0, 0.1, 0.2, ... 1.0}:\nwhere formula_40 is an interpolated precision that takes the maximum precision over all recalls greater than formula_22:\nAn alternative is to derive an analytical formula_21 function by assuming a particular parametric distribution for the underlying decision values. For example, a \"binormal precision-recall curve\" can be obtained by assuming decision values in both classes to follow a Gaussian distribution.\n\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Precision at K.\nFor modern (web-scale) information retrieval, recall is no longer a meaningful metric, as many queries have thousands of relevant documents, and few users will be interested in reading all of them. Precision at k documents (P@k) is still a useful metric (e.g., P@10 or \"Precision at 10\" corresponds to the number of relevant results on the first search results page), but fails to take into account the positions of the relevant documents among the top k. Another shortcoming is that on a query with fewer relevant results than k, even a perfect system will have a score less than 1. It is easier to score manually since only the top k results need to be examined to determine if they are relevant or not.\n\nSection::::Offline metrics.:R-Precision.\nR-precision requires knowing all documents that are relevant to a query. The number of relevant documents, formula_44, is used as the cutoff for calculation, and this varies from query to query. For example, if there are 15 documents relevant to \"red\" in a corpus (R=15), R-precision for \"red\" looks at the top 15 documents returned, counts the number that are relevant formula_22 turns that into a relevancy fraction: formula_46.\nPrecision is equal to recall at the R-th position.\nEmpirically, this measure is often highly correlated to mean average precision.\n\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Mean average precision.\nMean average precision for a set of queries is the mean of the average precision scores for each query.\nwhere \"Q\" is the number of queries.\n\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Discounted cumulative gain.\nDCG uses a graded relevance scale of documents from the result set to evaluate the usefulness, or gain, of a document based on its position in the result list. The premise of DCG is that highly relevant documents appearing lower in a search result list should be penalized as the graded relevance value is reduced logarithmically proportional to the position of the result.", "different queries or systems, to compare performances the normalised version of DCG uses an ideal DCG. To this end, it sorts documents of a result list by relevance, producing an ideal DCG at position p (formula_50), which normalizes the score:\nThe nDCG values for all queries can be averaged to obtain a measure of the average performance of a ranking algorithm. Note that in a perfect ranking algorithm, the formula_52 will be the same as the formula_50 producing an nDCG of 1.0. All nDCG calculations are then relative values on the interval 0.0 to 1.0 and so are cross-query comparable.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Other measures.\nBULLET::::- Mean reciprocal rank\nBULLET::::- Spearman's rank correlation coefficient\nBULLET::::- bpref - a summation-based measure of how many relevant documents are ranked before irrelevant documents\nBULLET::::- GMAP - geometric mean of (per-topic) average precision\nBULLET::::- Measures based on marginal relevance and document diversity - see\nBULLET::::- Measures of both relevance and credibility (for fake news in search results)\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Visualization.\nVisualizations of information retrieval performance include:\nBULLET::::- Graphs which chart precision on one axis and recall on the other\nBULLET::::- Histograms of average precision over various topics\nBULLET::::- Receiver operating characteristic (ROC curve)\nBULLET::::- Confusion matrix"], "wikipedia-20638398": ["The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are still evolving: they include indicators, benchmarks, audits, indexes and accounting, as well as assessment, appraisal and other reporting systems.

It is a detailed time-driven plan for program execution that helps to ensure on-time delivery dates are achieved, and that tracking and status tool are used during program execution. These tools must show progress, interrelationships and dependencies.\nThe primary objective of the IMP is a single plan that establishes the program or project fundamentals. It provides a hierarchical, event-based plan that contains: Events; Significant accomplishments; Entry and exit criteria; however it does not include any dates or durations. Using the IMP provides sufficient definition for explain program process and completion tracking, as well as providing effective communication of the program/project content and the \"\"What and How\"\" of the program.\nThe critical IMP attribute is its focus on events, when compared to effort or task focused planning.\nThe event focus asks and answers the question \"what does done look like?\" rather than what work has been done. Certainly work must be done to complete a task, but a focus solely on the work hides the more important metric of \"are we meeting our commitments?\" While meeting commitments is critical, it's important to first define the criteria used for judging if the commitments are being met. This is where Significant Accomplishments (SA) and their Accomplishment Criteria (AC) become important. It is important to meet commitments, but recognizing when the commitment has been met is even more important.\nThe IMP provides Program Traceability by expanding and complying with the program's Statement of Objectives (SOO), Technical Performance Requirements (TPRs), the Contract Work Breakdown Structure (CWBS), and the Contract Statement of Work (CSOW)\u2014all of which are based on the Customer's WBS to form the basis of the IMS and all cost reporting. The IMP implements a measurable and trackable program structure to accomplish integrated product development, integrate the functional program activities, and incorporates functional, lower-level and subcontractor IMPs. The IMP provides a framework for independent evaluation of Program Maturity by allowing insight into the overall effort with a level-of-detail that is consistent with levied risk and complexity metrics. It uses the methodology of decomposing events into a logical series of accomplishments having measurable criteria to demonstrate the completion and/or quality of accomplishments."], "wikipedia-50716473": ["Evaluation measures for an information retrieval system are used to assess how well the search results satisfied the user's query intent. Such metrics are often split into kinds: online metrics look at users' interactions with the search system, while offline metrics measure relevance, in other words how likely each result, or search engine results page (SERP) page as a whole, is to meet the information needs of the user.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Session abandonment rate.\nSession abandonment rate is a ratio of search sessions which do not result in a click.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Click-through rate.\nClick-through rate (CTR) is the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. It is commonly used to measure the success of an online advertising campaign for a particular website as well as the effectiveness of email campaigns.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Session success rate.\nSession success rate measures the ratio of user sessions that lead to a success. Defining \"success\" is often dependent on context, but for search a successful result is often measured using dwell time as a primary factor along with secondary user interaction, for instance, the user copying the result URL is considered a successful result, as is copy/pasting from the snippet.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Zero result rate.\n\"Zero result rate\" (\"ZRR\") is the ratio of SERPs which returned with zero results. The metric either indicates a recall issue, or that the information being searched for is not in the index.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Precision.\nPrecision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are relevant to the user's information need.\nIn binary classification, precision is analogous to positive predictive value. Precision takes all retrieved documents into account. It can also be evaluated at a given cut-off rank, considering only the topmost results returned by the system. This measure is called \"precision at n\" or \"P@n\".\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Recall.\nRecall is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved.\nIn binary classification, recall is often called sensitivity. So it can be looked at as \"the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query\".\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Fall-out.\nThe proportion of non-relevant documents that are retrieved, out of all non-relevant documents available:\nIn binary classification, fall-out is closely related to specificity and is equal to formula_9. It can be looked at as \"the probability that a non-relevant document is retrieved by the query\".\nSection::::Offline metrics.:F-score / F-measure.\nThe weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, the traditional F-measure or balanced F-score is:\nThis is also known as the formula_11 measure, because recall and precision are evenly weighted.\nThe general formula for non-negative real formula_12 is:\nTwo other commonly used F measures are the formula_14 measure, which weights recall twice as much as precision, and the formula_15 measure, which weights precision twice as much as recall.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Average precision.\nPrecision and recall are single-value metrics based on the whole list of documents returned by the system. For systems that return a ranked sequence of documents, it is desirable to also consider the order in which the returned documents are presented. By computing a precision and recall at every position in the ranked sequence of documents, one can plot a precision-recall curve, plotting precision formula_21 as a function of recall formula_22. Average precision computes the average value of formula_21 over the interval from formula_24 to formula_25:\nThat is the area under the precision-recall curve.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Precision at K.\nFor modern (web-scale) information retrieval, recall is no longer a meaningful metric, as many queries have thousands of relevant documents, and few users will be interested in reading all of them. Precision at k documents (P@k) is still a useful metric (e.g., P@10 or \"Precision at 10\" corresponds to the number of relevant results on the first search results page), but fails to take into account the positions of the relevant documents among the top k. Another shortcoming is that on a query with fewer relevant results than k, even a perfect system will have a score less than 1. It is easier to score manually since only the top k results need to be examined to determine if they are relevant or not.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:R-Precision.\nR-precision requires knowing all documents that are relevant to a query. The number of relevant documents, formula_44, is used as the cutoff for calculation, and this varies from query to query. For example, if there are 15 documents relevant to \"red\" in a corpus (R=15), R-precision for \"red\" looks at the top 15 documents returned, counts the number that are relevant formula_22 turns that into a relevancy fraction: formula_46.\nPrecision is equal to recall at the R-th position.\nEmpirically, this measure is often highly correlated to mean average precision.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Mean average precision.\nMean average precision for a set of queries is the mean of the average precision scores for each query.\nwhere \"Q\" is the number of queries.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Discounted cumulative gain.\nDCG uses a graded relevance scale of documents from the result set to evaluate the usefulness, or gain, of a document based on its position in the result list. The premise of DCG is that highly relevant documents appearing lower in a search result list should be penalized as the graded relevance value is reduced logarithmically proportional to the position of the result.\nThe DCG accumulated at a particular rank position formula_48 is defined as:", "The nDCG values for all queries can be averaged to obtain a measure of the average performance of a ranking algorithm. Note that in a perfect ranking algorithm, the formula_52 will be the same as the formula_50 producing an nDCG of 1.0. All nDCG calculations are then relative values on the interval 0.0 to 1.0 and so are cross-query comparable.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Other measures.\nBULLET::::- Mean reciprocal rank\nBULLET::::- Spearman's rank correlation coefficient\nBULLET::::- bpref - a summation-based measure of how many relevant documents are ranked before irrelevant documents\nBULLET::::- GMAP - geometric mean of (per-topic) average precision\nBULLET::::- Measures based on marginal relevance and document diversity - see\nBULLET::::- Measures of both relevance and credibility (for fake news in search results)\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Visualization.\nVisualizations of information retrieval performance include:\nBULLET::::- Graphs which chart precision on one axis and recall on the other\nBULLET::::- Histograms of average precision over various topics\nBULLET::::- Receiver operating characteristic (ROC curve)\nBULLET::::- Confusion matrix"], "wikipedia-20638398": ["The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are still evolving: they include indicators, benchmarks, audits, indexes and accounting, as well as assessment, appraisal and other reporting systems.

However some behaviors cause different amounts of harm depending upon how many other people are performing them. For these behaviors, universal practice tests generally give counter-intuitive, and often quite harmful recommendations, for cases in which not everyone else is doing the same thing we are doing. This occurs in two general kinds of cases: responding to evil-doers, and solving coordination problems. Together they are typically called \"partial compliance\" problems, because they deal with the question of what would be a morally correct response to a situation where other persons are not doing the same thing you are doing (or considering doing).\nThe first is illustrated by a disposition to complete pacifism. In any world where everyone is pacifistic, little harm is done, so it passes most universal practice tests. But in a realistic world containing many non-pacifists, an individual's commitment to complete pacifism is likely to not only make him a victim of evil-doers, but unable to defend innocent third parties from the latter, resulting in much greater harm than a more complex conditional disposition, like \"be pacifist only if all others are pacifistic, but defend yourself and others from aggression if necessary.\"\nThe second is exemplified by the need to choose which side of the road to drive on.

This quantity should be understood as the amount of randomness in the random variable formula_17 given the random variable formula_18.", "Shannon's entropy measures the information contained in a message as opposed to the portion of the message that is determined (or predictable). \"Examples of the latter include redundancy in language structure or statistical properties relating to the occurrence frequencies of letter or word pairs, triplets etc.\" See Markov chain."], "wikipedia-14773": ["A key measure in information theory is \"entropy\". Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a random variable or the outcome of a random process. For example, identifying the outcome of a fair coin flip (with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a (with six equally likely outcomes).", "set of all messages that could be, and is the probability of some formula_3, then the entropy, , of is defined:\n(Here, is the self-information, which is the entropy contribution of an individual message, and is the expected value.)

It demands as given some partly specified model and some specified data related to the model. It selects a preferred probability distribution to represent the model.

Entropy is often defined as a measurement of disorder, or randomness, but this can be misleading. For Shannon's purposes, the entropy of a system is the number of possible states that the system has the capacity to be in. Any one of these potential states can constitute a message. For example, a typewritten page can bear as many different messages as there are different combinations of characters that can be arranged on the page. The information content of a message can only be understood against the background context of all of the messages that could have been sent, but weren't. Information is produced by a reduction of entropy in the message medium."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-15445": 3, "wikipedia-14773": 3, "wikipedia-812296": 1, "wikipedia-3015758": 1, "wikipedia-7319263": 1, "wikipedia-4700845": 1, "wikipedia-1731689": 1, "wikipedia-427282": 1, "wikipedia-7728392": 1, "wikipedia-41856558": 3}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-15445": 3, "wikipedia-14773": 3, "wikipedia-812296": 1, "wikipedia-3015758": 2, "wikipedia-7319263": 1, "wikipedia-4700845": 1, "wikipedia-1731689": 2, "wikipedia-427282": 2, "wikipedia-7728392": 1, "wikipedia-41856558": 3}}}

There are five modes of play \u2013 Brain Age Check, Training, Quick Play, Download, and Sudoku.\nWhen starting a session, Kawashima may ask the player to participate in a Picture-Drawing Quiz, which requires the player to draw a person, place, or thing by memory using the touch screen. After the player has done all three, the game will compare his or her drawing to an example created by the game developers, along with advice of what to emphasize on below its image. If more than one player profile is saved on the game card, images for the day can be compared to those of other players.\nKawashima may also ask the player to participate in a Memory Quiz, which requires the player to recall a recent event, such as what the player ate or the most interesting thing seen on television the day before. Several days later, it will ask for the answer originally provided, and will then compare the answer given several days ago and the answer given on the current day to test the player's recollection skills. The player is not scored on his or her ability to remember. The purpose of these tasks is to help the player improve his or her recollection.\nSection::::Gameplay.:Brain Age Check.\nThe game includes four modes: Brain Age Check, Training, Quick Play, and Sudoku. The Brain Age Check gives the player three puzzles to complete. The first is usually a Stroop test, although the player can choose to skip the Stroop test if he or she is not in a quiet environment or is otherwise unable to speak into the microphone. At the end of the Brain Age Check, the game reports on the players \"brain age\", a theoretical assessment of the age of the player's brain. The higher the brain age, the worse the player performed. The best possible score is 20, according with Kawashima's theory that the brain stops developing at 20. The player may replay the Brain Age Check, but it will not change the brain age for the day.\nOnce the player confirms whether or not he or she can speak into the microphone, Professor Kawashima will describe the first puzzle. If the player answered that they can speak, the game begins with a Stroop test; if the player cannot use the microphone, the game picks a random puzzle from the following: Calculations X 20, Word Memory, Connect Maze, Number Cruncher, and Speed Counting.\nDuring the Stroop Test, the game will display one of four words: blue, black, yellow, and red. A random word will appear on screen, one after another, each appearing in a random color (which may not match the color denoted by the word). The player is instructed to say the color of the word, rather than its semantic meaning (e.g., if the word \"Yellow\" appears in blue letters, the player should say \"blue\" \u2013 see Stroop effect for details).\nIn Speed Counting, which requires speaking but does not use the microphone, the player counts up from one to 120 as fast as they can without slurring the names of numbers.\nWord Memory gives the player a list of 30 four-letter words. The player is given two minutes to study the list and memorize as many words as possible. After this two minutes is up, the player must write down as many words as he or she can in three minutes. Another puzzle called Connect Maze gives players a randomly created group of circles, with letters and numbers in them. There is one circle for every letter in \"A\" through \"M\", as well as a circle for every number from 1 to 13. The player must then connect a line between a letter and a number, starting with \"A\". The player must connect the letter \"A\" to the number one, and then connect it to the letter \"B\" and then the number two, and so on until the player reaches 13.\nCalculations X 20 presents the player with 20 mathematical equations, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. On the top screen are the questions, which scroll up as they are answered (whether correctly or incorrectly), while the touch screen is used to write out the answer.\nIn Number Cruncher, the player is presented with a series of screens displaying several numbers, which vary in their appearance and on-screen behavior. For instance, a screen may display five blue numbers, three red numbers, and one moving yellow number, and above it is a question, such as \"how many blue numbers are there?\", which the player must answer as quickly and accurately as possible.", "BULLET::::4. Low to High features several boxes on both screens, each in the same pattern as each other. The game will count down at varying speeds, and when it hits zero, numbers will appear in these boxes for a short period of time. Afterwards, the player must touch the boxes on the touch screen from lowest number to highest by memorizing the numbers on the top screen. Afterwards, the game will introduce one puzzle after the other in a similar fashion. The quantity of boxes to memorize increases after each correct answer, and decreases after each incorrect answer, with the minimum quantity of boxes being four, and the maximum being 16.\nBULLET::::5. Syllable Count shows several phrases, one after the other, on the top screen, and the player must write the number of syllables in each phrase on the touch screen.\nBULLET::::6. Head Count features a group of people on the top screen (e.g. 4). After a few seconds to allow the player to count the number of people, a house falls over them. The player must watch the screen carefully, as the people inside will leave the house and more people will enter the house. This will eventually cease, and the game asks the player to write down how many people are currently in the house. The puzzle gets more difficult as the player progresses in it. There is also a hard mode in which people also come in and out of the chimney.\nBULLET::::7. Triangle Math has a series of mathematical equations that the player must solve. It is designed similarly to the Calculation puzzles, in that the equation appears on one screen, and the player writes the answer on the touch screen. The equations involve three numbers and two mathematical operations (e.g., 3 + 4 + 8 or 3 \u2212 4 + 8), and are solved by performing the first operation, and then the second. This also features a hard mode where an extra tier is added to the triangle.\nBULLET::::8.

The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the \"American Statistician\" in 1975 , . It became famous as a question from a reader's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's \"Ask Marilyn\" column in \"Parade\" magazine in 1990 :\nVos Savant's response was that the contestant should switch to the other door . Under the standard assumptions, contestants who switch have a chance of winning the car, while contestants who stick to their initial choice have only a chance.\nThe given probabilities depend on specific assumptions about how the host and contestant choose their doors. A key insight is that, under these standard conditions, there is more information about doors 2 and 3 that was not available at the beginning of the game, when door 1 was chosen by the player: the host's deliberate action adds value to the door he did not choose to eliminate, but not to the one chosen by the contestant originally.

Other possible behaviors than the one described can reveal different additional information, or none at all, and yield different probabilities.", "The simple solutions above show that a player with a strategy of switching wins the car with overall probability , i.e., without taking account of which door was opened by the host (Grinstead and Snell 2006:137\u2013138 Carlton 2005).

A critical region is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis. The probability of type I error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true (statistical significance) and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator doesn't belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The statistical power of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.\n\nReferring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms. For example, in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect, such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably.\n\nAlthough in principle the acceptable level of statistical significance may be subject to debate, the p-value is the smallest significance level that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis.

It is closely related to the number of microscopic configurations (known as microstates) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy formula_1 is the natural logarithm of the number of microstates, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant . Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of the lack of information about it.", "Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the Carnot cycle. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its absolute temperature). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a function of state, specifically a thermodynamic state of the system. \n\nThe interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics is the measure of uncertainty, or \"mixedupness\" in the phrase of Gibbs, which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible microstates. In contrast to the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways in which a system may be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder). This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) which could give rise to the observed macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the Boltzmann constant.", "Entropy can be defined for any Markov processes with reversible dynamics and the detailed balance property.\nIn Boltzmann's 1896 \"Lectures on Gas Theory\", he showed that this expression gives a measure of entropy for systems of atoms and molecules in the gas phase, thus providing a measure for the entropy of classical thermodynamics.\nEntropy arises directly from the Carnot cycle. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\nIn a thermodynamic system, pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the equilibrium state has higher probability (more possible combinations of microstates) than any other state.\nAs an example, for a glass of ice water in air at room temperature, the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the thermal energy from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an isolated system such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the thermodynamic system is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved state function that is of great importance in the sciences of physics and chemistry. Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their time reversals (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy. For isolated systems, entropy never decreases. This fact has several important consequences in science: first, it prohibits \"perpetual motion\" machines; and second, it implies the arrow of entropy has the same direction as the arrow of time. Increases in entropy correspond to irreversible changes in a system, because some energy is expended as waste heat, limiting the amount of work a system can do.\nUnlike many other functions of state, entropy cannot be directly observed but must be calculated. Entropy can be calculated for a substance as the standard molar entropy from absolute zero (also known as absolute entropy) or as a difference in entropy from some other reference state which is defined as zero entropy. Entropy has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of joules per kelvin (J/K) in the International System of Units. While these are the same units as heat capacity, the two concepts are distinct. Entropy is not a conserved quantity: for example, in an isolated system with non-uniform temperature, heat might irreversibly flow and the temperature become more uniform such that entropy increases. The second law of thermodynamics states that a closed system has entropy which may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine. A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.", "Entropy is equally essential in predicting the extent and direction of complex chemical reactions. For such applications, \u0394\"S\" must be incorporated in an expression that includes both the system and its surroundings, \u0394\"S\" = \u0394\"S\" + \u0394\"S\" . This expression becomes, via some steps, the Gibbs free energy equation for reactants and products in the system: \u0394\"G\" [the Gibbs free energy change of the system] = \u0394\"H\" [the enthalpy change] \u2212 \"T\" \u0394\"S\" [the entropy change].\n\nThe following is a list of additional definitions of entropy from a collection of textbooks:\nBULLET::::- a measure of energy dispersal at a specific temperature.\nBULLET::::- a measure of disorder in the universe or of the availability of the energy in a system to do work.\nBULLET::::- a measure of a system's thermal energy per unit temperature that is unavailable for doing useful work.\n\nIn Boltzmann's definition, entropy is a measure of the number of possible microscopic states (or microstates) of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium.", "A definition of entropy based entirely on the relation of adiabatic accessibility between equilibrium states was given by E.H.Lieb and J. Yngvason in 1999. This approach has several predecessors, including the pioneering work of Constantin Carath\u00e9odory from 1909 and the monograph by R. Giles. In the setting of Lieb and Yngvason one starts by picking, for a unit amount of the substance under consideration, two reference states formula_53 and formula_54 such that the latter is adiabatically accessible from the former but not vice versa. Defining the entropies of the reference states to be 0 and 1 respectively the entropy of a state formula_55 is defined as the largest number formula_56 such that formula_55 is adiabatically accessible from a composite state consisting of an amount formula_56 in the state formula_54 and a complementary amount, formula_60, in the state formula_53. A simple but important result within this setting is that entropy is uniquely determined, apart from a choice of unit and an additive constant for each chemical element, by the following properties: It is monotonic with respect to the relation of adiabatic accessibility, additive on composite systems, and extensive under scaling.\n\nIn quantum statistical mechanics, the concept of entropy was developed by John von Neumann and is generally referred to as \"von Neumann entropy\",\nwhere \u03c1 is the density matrix and Tr is the trace operator.\nThis upholds the correspondence principle, because in the classical limit, when the phases between the basis states used for the classical probabilities are purely random, this expression is equivalent to the familiar classical definition of entropy,\ni.e. in such a basis the density matrix is diagonal.\nVon Neumann established a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics with his work \"Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik\". He provided in this work a theory of measurement, where the usual notion of wave function collapse is described as an irreversible process (the so-called von Neumann or projective measurement). Using this concept, in conjunction with the density matrix he extended the classical concept of entropy into the quantum domain.\n\nWhen viewed in terms of information theory, the entropy state function is simply the amount of information (in the Shannon sense) that would be needed to specify the full microstate of the system. This is left unspecified by the macroscopic description.\nIn information theory, \"entropy\" is the measure of the amount of information that is missing before reception and is sometimes referred to as \"Shannon entropy\". Shannon entropy is a broad and general concept which finds applications in information theory as well as thermodynamics. It was originally devised by Claude Shannon in 1948 to study the amount of information in a transmitted message. The definition of the information entropy is, however, quite general, and is expressed in terms of a discrete set of probabilities \"p so that\nIn the case of transmitted messages, these probabilities were the probabilities that a particular message was actually transmitted, and the entropy of the message system was a measure of the average amount of information in a message. For the case of equal probabilities (i.e. each message is equally probable), the Shannon entropy (in bits) is just the number of yes/no questions needed to determine the content of the message.\n\nThe expressions for the two entropies are similar. If \"W\" is the number of microstates that can yield a given macrostate, and each microstate has the same \"a priori\" probability, then that probability is . The Shannon entropy (in nats) is:\nand if entropy is measured in units of \"k\" per nat, then the entropy is given by:\nwhich is the famous Boltzmann entropy formula when \"k\" is Boltzmann's constant, which may be interpreted as the thermodynamic entropy per nat."], "wikipedia-4700845": ["Entropy is a property of thermodynamical systems. The term entropy was introduced by Rudolf Clausius who named it from the Greek word \u03c4\u03c1o\u03c0\u03ae, \"transformation\". He considered transfers of energy as heat and work between bodies of matter, taking temperature into account. Bodies of radiation are also covered by the same kind of reasoning.\n\nLudwig Boltzmann explained the entropy as a measure of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) which comply with the macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. Boltzmann then went on to show that was equal to the thermodynamic entropy. The factor has since been known as Boltzmann's constant.\n\nFrom a \"macroscopic perspective\", in classical thermodynamics, the entropy is a state function of a thermodynamic system: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. Entropy is a key ingredient of the Second law of thermodynamics, which has important consequences e.g. for the performance of heat engines, refrigerators, and heat pumps.\n\nAccording to the Clausius equality, for a closed homogeneous system, in which only reversible processes take place,\nWith T being the uniform temperature of the closed system and delta Q the incremental reversible transfer of heat energy into that system.\nThat means the line integral formula_2 is path independent.\nSo we can define a state function \"S\", called entropy, which satisfies"], "wikipedia-53982660": ["The thermodynamics of black holes suggests certain relationships between the entropy of black holes and their geometry.

The horizon of the black hole acts as a \"screen\" distinguishing one region of the spacetime (in this case the exterior of the black hole) that is not affected by another region (in this case the interior). The Bekenstein-Hawking area law states that the area of this surface is proportional to the entropy of the information lost behind it. \nThe Bekentein-Hawking entropy is a statement about the gravitational entropy of a system; however, there is another type of entropy that is important in quantum information theory, namely the entanglement (or von-Neumann) entropy. This form of entropy provides a measure of how far from a pure state a given quantum state is, or, equivalently, how entangled it is. The entanglement entropy is a useful concept in many areas, such as in condensed matter physics and quantum many-body systems.

This is equivalent to choosing to measure information in nats instead of the usual bits (or more formally, shannons).

One nat is about 1.44 bits.", "Clausius' statement \"dS= \u03b4Q/T\", or, equivalently, when all other effective displacements are zero, \"dS=dU/T\", is the only way to actually measure thermodynamic entropy. It is only with the introduction of statistical mechanics, the viewpoint that a thermodynamic system consists of a collection of particles and which explains classical thermodynamics in terms of probability distributions, that the entropy can be considered separately from temperature and energy. This is expressed in Boltzmann's famous entropy formula \"S=k ln(W)\". Here \"k\" is Boltzmann's constant, and \"W\" is the number of equally probable microstates which yield a particular thermodynamic state, or macrostate. Boltzmann's equation is presumed to provide a link between thermodynamic entropy \"S\" and information entropy \"H = \u2212\u03a3i pi ln pi\" = ln(W)\" where p=1/W\" are the equal probabilities of a given microstate."], "wikipedia-7319263": ["Entropy can be described in terms of \"energy dispersal\" and the \"spreading of energy,\" while avoiding all mention of \"disorder\" and \"chaos\" except when explaining misconceptions. All explanations of where and how energy is dispersing or spreading have been recast in terms of energy dispersal, so as to emphasise the underlying qualitative meaning. In this approach, the second law of thermodynamics is introduced as \"Energy spontaneously disperses from being localized to becoming spread out if it is not hindered from doing so,\" often in the context of common experiences such as a rock falling, a hot frying pan cooling down, iron rusting, air leaving a punctured tyre and ice melting in a warm room. Entropy is then depicted as a sophisticated kind of \"before and after\" yardstick \u2014 measuring how much energy is spread out over time as a result of a process such as heating a system, or how widely spread out the energy is after something happens in comparison with its previous state, in a process such as gas expansion or fluids mixing (at a constant temperature). The equations are explored with reference to the common experiences, with emphasis that in chemistry the energy that entropy measures as dispersing is the internal energy of molecules. The statistical interpretation is related to quantum mechanics in describing the way that energy is distributed (quantized) amongst molecules on specific energy levels, with all the energy of the macrostate always in only one microstate at one instant. Entropy is described as measuring the energy dispersal for a system by the number of accessible microstates, the number of different arrangements of all its energy at the next instant. Thus, an increase in entropy means a greater number of microstates for the final state than for the initial state, and hence more possible arrangements of a system's total energy at any one instant. Here, the greater 'dispersal of the total energy of a system' means the existence of many possibilities."], "wikipedia-15445": ["Information entropy is the average rate at which information is produced by a stochastic source of data. The measure of information entropy associated with each possible data value is the negative logarithm of the probability mass function for the value: \nWhen the data source produces a low-probability value (i.e., when a low-probability event occurs), the event carries more \"information\" (\"surprisal\") than when the source data produces a high-probability value. The amount of information conveyed by each event defined in this way becomes a random variable whose expected value is the information entropy. Generally, \"entropy\" refers to disorder or uncertainty, and the definition of entropy used in information theory is directly analogous to the definition used in statistical thermodynamics. The concept of information entropy was introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\".\n\nThe basic idea of information theory is that the \"news value\" of a communicated message depends on the degree to which the content of the message is surprising. If an event is very probable, it is no surprise (and generally uninteresting) when that event happens as expected. However, if an event is unlikely to occur, it is much more informative to learn that the event happened or will happen. For instance, the knowledge that some particular number \"will not\" be the winning number of a lottery provides very little information, because any particular chosen number will almost certainly not win. However, knowledge that a particular number \"will\" win a lottery has high value because it communicates the outcome of a very low probability event. The information content (also called the \"surprisal\") of an event formula_2 is an increasing function of the reciprocal of the probability formula_3 of the event, precisely formula_4. Entropy measures the expected (i.e., average) amount of information conveyed by identifying the outcome of a random trial.", "Named after Boltzmann's \u0397-theorem, Shannon defined the entropy (Greek capital letter eta) of a discrete random variable formula_10 with possible values formula_11 and probability mass function formula_12 as:\nHere formula_14 is the expected value operator, and is the information content of .\nformula_15 is itself a random variable.\nThe entropy can explicitly be written as\nwhere is the base of the logarithm used.

Entropy, then, can only decrease from the value associated with uniform probability.

The entropy is zero: each toss of the coin delivers no new information as the outcome of each coin toss is always certain.\nTo understand the meaning of , first define an information function in terms of an event with probability .

It is closely related to the number of microscopic configurations (known as microstates) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy formula_1 is the natural logarithm of the number of microstates, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant . Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),", "Clausius called this state function \"entropy\". One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by Rudolf Clausius and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an isolated system in thermodynamic equilibrium with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the Carnot cycle. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its absolute temperature). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a function of state, specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nAccording to the Clausius equality, for a reversible cyclic process:\nformula_10\nThis means the line integral formula_11 is path-independent.\nSo we can define a state function called entropy, which satisfies\nformula_12\nClausius coined the name \"entropy\" () for in 1865. He gives \"transformational content\" () as a synonym, paralleling his \"thermal and ergonal content\" () as the name of , but preferring the term \"entropy\" as a close parallel of \"energy\", formed by replacing the root of \"work\" by that of \"transformation\".\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in classical thermodynamics the entropy is interpreted as a state function of a thermodynamic system: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394\"E\", and its entropy falls by \u0394\"S\", a quantity at least \"T\" \u0394\"S\" of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (\"T\" is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nThe statistical definition was developed by Ludwig Boltzmann in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor which has since been known as Boltzmann's constant. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics is the measure of uncertainty, or \"mixedupness\" in the phrase of Gibbs, which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible microstates. In contrast to the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways in which a system may be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder). This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) which could give rise to the observed macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the Boltzmann constant.", "Entropy arises directly from the Carnot cycle. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\nIn a thermodynamic system, pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the equilibrium state has higher probability (more possible combinations of microstates) than any other state.\nAs an example, for a glass of ice water in air at room temperature, the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the thermal energy from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an isolated system such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the thermodynamic system is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved state function that is of great importance in the sciences of physics and chemistry. Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their time reversals (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy. For isolated systems, entropy never decreases. This fact has several important consequences in science: first, it prohibits \"perpetual motion\" machines; and second, it implies the arrow of entropy has the same direction as the arrow of time. Increases in entropy correspond to irreversible changes in a system, because some energy is expended as waste heat, limiting the amount of work a system can do.\nUnlike many other functions of state, entropy cannot be directly observed but must be calculated. Entropy can be calculated for a substance as the standard molar entropy from absolute zero (also known as absolute entropy) or as a difference in entropy from some other reference state which is defined as zero entropy. Entropy has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of joules per kelvin (J/K) in the International System of Units. While these are the same units as heat capacity, the two concepts are distinct. Entropy is not a conserved quantity: for example, in an isolated system with non-uniform temperature, heat might irreversibly flow and the temperature become more uniform such that entropy increases. The second law of thermodynamics states that a closed system has entropy which may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine. A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine."], "wikipedia-4700845": ["Entropy is a property of thermodynamical systems. The term entropy was introduced by Rudolf Clausius who named it from the Greek word \u03c4\u03c1o\u03c0\u03ae, \"transformation\". He considered transfers of energy as heat and work between bodies of matter, taking temperature into account. Bodies of radiation are also covered by the same kind of reasoning.\n\nLudwig Boltzmann explained the entropy as a measure of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) which comply with the macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. Boltzmann then went on to show that was equal to the thermodynamic entropy. The factor has since been known as Boltzmann's constant.\n\nIn a thermodynamic system, differences in pressure, density, and temperature all tend to equalize over time. For example, consider a room containing a glass of melting ice as one system. The difference in temperature between the warm room and the cold glass of ice and water is equalized as heat from the room is transferred to the cooler ice and water mixture. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room achieve balance. The entropy of the room has decreased. However, the entropy of the glass of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the room has decreased. In an isolated system, such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler regions always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the system of the room and ice water system has reached temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at its maximum. The entropy of the thermodynamic system is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nFrom a \"macroscopic perspective\", in classical thermodynamics, the entropy is a state function of a thermodynamic system: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. Entropy is a key ingredient of the Second law of thermodynamics, which has important consequences e.g. for the performance of heat engines, refrigerators, and heat pumps.\n\nAccording to the Clausius equality, for a closed homogeneous system, in which only reversible processes take place,\n\nWith T being the uniform temperature of the closed system and delta Q the incremental reversible transfer of heat energy into that system.\n\nThat means the line integral formula_2 is path independent.\n\nSo we can define a state function \"S\", called entropy, which satisfies"], "wikipedia-7319263": ["In physics education, the concept of entropy is traditionally introduced as a quantitative measure of disorder.

To understand what microstates and macrostates are, consider the example of a gas in a container. At a microscopic level, the gas consists of a vast number of freely moving atoms, which occasionally collide with one another and with the walls of the container. The microstate of the system is a description of the positions and momenta of all the atoms. In principle, all the physical properties of the system are determined by its microstate. However, because the number of atoms is so large, the details of the motion of individual atoms is mostly irrelevant to the behavior of the system as a whole. Provided the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium, the system can be adequately described by a handful of macroscopic quantities, called \"thermodynamic variables\": the total energy \"E\", volume \"V\", pressure \"P\", temperature \"T\", and so forth. The macrostate of the system is a description of its thermodynamic variables.\n\nThere are three important points to note. Firstly, to specify any one microstate, we need to write down an impractically long list of numbers, whereas specifying a macrostate requires only a few numbers (\"E\", \"V\", etc.). However, and this is the second point, the usual thermodynamic equations only describe the macrostate of a system adequately when this system is in equilibrium; non-equilibrium situations can generally \"not\" be described by a small number of variables. As a simple example, consider adding a drop of food coloring to a glass of water. The food coloring diffuses in a complicated manner, which is in practice very difficult to precisely predict. However, after sufficient time has passed the system will reach a uniform color, which is much less complicated to describe. Actually, the macroscopic state of the system will be described by a small number of variables only if the system is at global thermodynamic equilibrium. Thirdly, more than one microstate can correspond to a single macrostate. In fact, for any given macrostate, there will be a huge number of microstates that are consistent with the given values of \"E\", \"V\", etc.\n\nWe are now ready to provide a definition of entropy.

It turns out that \"S\" is itself a thermodynamic property, just like \"E\" or \"V\". Therefore, it acts as a link between the microscopic world and the macroscopic.

If one of the values is more probable to occur than the others, an observation that this value occurs is less informative than if some less common outcome had occurred. Conversely, rarer events provide more information when observed. Since observation of less probable events occurs more rarely, the net effect is that the entropy (thought of as average information) received from non-uniformly distributed data is always less than or equal to . Entropy is zero when one outcome is certain to occur. The entropy quantifies these considerations when a probability distribution of the source data is known.

Results revealed that people who feel self-conceptual uncertainty are motivated to join groups in which they identify with as an efficient strategy and immediate way to reduce one's self-conceptual uncertainty. Hogg bases his argument on the premise that subjective uncertainty, especially those about one's self and identity are unpleasant and that people strive to reduce uncertainties they feel about themselves.\n\nUsing uncertainty reduction theory and predicted outcome value theory, a study of 6477 randomly selected data sets of auctions conducted on eBay.com indicated that the more detailed information about a certain product was available as part of the product description the more bids there were and the higher the final bid was. In addition, a higher seller's reputation resulted in more bids and a higher selling price.

This limited access to nonverbal cues produces a different set of concerns for individuals, as well as a different set of tools for reducing uncertainty. Gibbs, Ellison and Lai report that individuals on online dating websites attempt to reduce uncertainty at three levels: personal security, misrepresentation, and recognition. The asynchronous nature of the communications and the added privacy concerns may make people want to engage in interactive behaviors and seek confirmatory information sooner than those who engage in offline dating.\n\nParents and surrogate mothers have great incentive for reducing uncertainty, taking optimal control, and finding a suitable third party for their pregnancy process. May and Tenzek assert that three themes emerged from their study of online ads from surrogate mothers: idealism, logistics, and personal information. Idealism refers to surrogates' decision to share details regarding their lifestyle and health. Logistics refers to the surrogates' requested financial needs and services. Personal information refers to the disclosure of details that would typically take several interactions before occurring, but has the benefit of adding a degree of tangible humanness to the surrogate (e.g. the disclosure of family photos). Idealism, logistics and personal information all function to reduce potential parents' uncertainty about a surrogate mother."], "wikipedia-28565245": ["Uncertainty reduction theory comes from the sociopsychological perspective. It addresses the basic process of how we gain knowledge about other people. According to the theory, people have difficulty with uncertainty.

As we communicate, we are making plans to accomplish our goals.\n\nAt highly uncertain moments, we become more vigilant and rely more on data available in the situation. When we are less certain, we lose confidence in our own plans and make contingency plans. The theory also says that higher levels of uncertainty create distance between people and that non-verbal expressiveness tends to help reduce uncertainty.\n\nConstructs include level of uncertainty, nature of the relationship and ways to reduce uncertainty. Underlying assumptions include that an individual will cognitively process the existence of uncertainty and take steps to reduce it. The boundary conditions for this theory are that there must be some kind of outside social situation trigger and internal cognitive process.\n\nAccording to the theory, we reduce uncertainty in three ways:\nBULLET::::1. Passive strategies: observing the person.\nBULLET::::2. Active strategies: asking others about the person or looking up info.\nBULLET::::3.

Strategies as seeking information, focusing on primary goals, contingency planning, plan adaptation, accretive planning, and framing are often utilized by human communicators.\nAccording to Berger, If a person were to observe another in their natural environment, intentionally unnoticeable, to gain information on another, would be categorized as using a passive tactic for reducing uncertainties. For example, watching someone in class, cafeteria, or any common area without attracting attention.\nAn active strategist would result to means of reducing uncertainties without any personal direct contact. For example, if one were to ask a friend about a particular person, or ask the particular person's friend for some information without actually confronting the person directly.\nAn interactive strategist would directly confront the individual and engage in some form of dialog to reduce the uncertainties between the two.\nThese strategies are meaningful to communication studies in a way that people's \"unique capacities for forethought and planning and their ability to monitor carefully ongoing communication episodes\" is valued in communicative process.\nA new strategy for reducing uncertainty was suggested in 2002 by Ramirez, Walther, Burgoon, and Sunnafrank that complements computer mediated communication and the technological advancements. Given the vast amount of information one could find about an individual via online resources a fourth uncertainty reduction strategy that uses online mediums to obtain information was labeled as extractive information seeking.", "Results revealed that people who feel self-conceptual uncertainty are motivated to join groups in which they identify with as an efficient strategy and immediate way to reduce one's self-conceptual uncertainty. Hogg bases his argument on the premise that subjective uncertainty, especially those about one's self and identity are unpleasant and that people strive to reduce uncertainties they feel about themselves.\nA person's self-categorization is affected by group identification including nationality, religion, gender, ethnicity and many other associated groups. Thus people continue to try to reduce the uncertainties they feel about themselves by identifying with even more specific groups. There is also evidence that people who are highly uncertain about themselves are more likely to identify with more homogeneous groups to reduce their uncertainty of self and reach a more definite state. Generally, people will be able to reduce their self-uncertainty either significantly or to a low degree, depending on the type of group they join and to what extent one can relate to his or herself within a group.\nUsing uncertainty reduction theory and predicted outcome value theory, a study of 6477 randomly selected data sets of auctions conducted on eBay.com indicated that the more detailed information about a certain product was available as part of the product description the more bids there were and the higher the final bid was. In addition, a higher seller's reputation resulted in more bids and a higher selling price. One means to reduce the uncertainty of a product's worth is having extensive descriptions and pictures of the item available and more positive feedback from previous users.\nFindings from the study illustrate that uncertainty reduction theory provides an insightful framework in which individuals' initial interactions in the context of online auctions can be understood. The study also provides evidence that strategies for reducing uncertainty in online initial interaction are similar to those used in face-to-face transactions. Although online auction users seem to favor passive strategies, including viewing product information and seller reputation, there are more active strategies in use: a user may look up the seller in other online platforms to gather relevant information or may use an interactive strategy, sending a private message to the seller asking for more information.\nGibbs, Ellison and Lai report that individuals on online dating websites attempt to reduce uncertainty at three levels: personal security, misrepresentation, and recognition. The asynchronous nature of the communications and the added privacy concerns may make people want to engage in interactive behaviors and seek confirmatory information sooner than those who engage in offline dating.\nOnline dating mainly supports passive strategies for reducing uncertainties. The option to view profiles online without needing to directly contact an individual is the main premise of passively reducing uncertainties. Gibbs, et al. found that \"participants who used uncertainty reduction strategies tended to disclose more personal information in terms of revealing private thoughts and feelings, suggesting a process whereby online dating participants proactively engage in uncertainty reduction activities to confirm the private information of others, which then prompts their own disclosure.\"\nMay and Tenzek assert that three themes emerged from their study of online ads from surrogate mothers: idealism, logistics, and personal information. Idealism refers to surrogates' decision to share details regarding their lifestyle and health. Logistics refers to the surrogates' requested financial needs and services. Personal information refers to the disclosure of details that would typically take several interactions before occurring, but has the benefit of adding a degree of tangible humanness to the surrogate (e.g. the disclosure of family photos). Idealism, logistics and personal information all function to reduce potential parents' uncertainty about a surrogate mother.", "MRU suggests at least four different reasons for low motivation to seek information:\nBULLET::::- People do not experience uncertainty in every event or encounter. Predictable or easily understood situations will not result in significant levels of uncertainty.\nBULLET::::- Individuals have different levels of tolerance for uncertainty. The more one tolerates uncertainty the less information one seeks.\nBULLET::::- Because communication always has social or effort costs, minimizing those costs with limited effort may be preferable to information seeking.\nBULLET::::- Individuals may also create certainty with minimal information seeking and without overt communication. For example, classification systems, such as stereotyping, create certainty out of uncertain situations.\nResearch demonstrates that MRU could be used to examine how employees manage uncertainty during adjustment processes. MRU uses theoretical explanations for examining the approaches to understanding group decision making. \"When groups are highly motivated to reduce the uncertainty surrounding a decision and there are no competing motives such as time or cost limitations, highly rational behaviors lead to information seeking to reduce uncertainty to optimize decisions.\" MRU could be used at the organizational level to examine communication related to organizational strategy."], "wikipedia-5987648": ["An example would be to predict the acceleration of a human body in a head-on crash with another car: even if we exactly knew the speed, small differences in the manufacturing of individual cars, how tightly every bolt has been tightened, etc., will lead to different results that can only be predicted in a statistical sense.\n\nSome examples of this are the local free-fall acceleration in a falling object experiment, various material properties in a finite element analysis for engineering, and multiplier uncertainty in the context of macroeconomic policy optimization.\n\nFor example, the dimensions of a work piece in a process of manufacture may not be exactly as designed and instructed, which would cause variability in its performance.\n\nOne example is when modeling the process of a falling object using the free-fall model; the model itself is inaccurate since there always exists air friction. In this case, even if there is no unknown parameter in the model, a discrepancy is still expected between the model and true physics.\n\nFor example, a single arrow shot with a mechanical bow that exactly duplicates each launch (the same acceleration, altitude, direction and final velocity) will not all impact the same point on the target due to random and complicated vibrations of the arrow shaft, the knowledge of which cannot be determined sufficiently to eliminate the resulting scatter of impact points.\n\nAn example of a source of this uncertainty would be the drag in an experiment designed to measure the acceleration of gravity near the earth's surface. The commonly used gravitational acceleration of 9.8 m/s^2 ignores the effects of air resistance, but the air resistance for the object could be measured and incorporated into the experiment to reduce the resulting uncertainty in the calculation of the gravitational acceleration."], "wikipedia-63778": ["For example, if it is unknown whether or not it will rain tomorrow, then there is a state of uncertainty. If probabilities are applied to the possible outcomes using weather forecasts or even just a calibrated probability assessment, the uncertainty has been quantified. Suppose it is quantified as a 90% chance of sunshine. If there is a major, costly, outdoor event planned for tomorrow then there is a risk since there is a 10% chance of rain, and rain would be undesirable. Furthermore, if this is a business event and $100,000 would be lost if it rains, then the risk has been quantified (a 10% chance of losing $100,000). These situations can be made even more realistic by quantifying light rain vs. heavy rain, the cost of delays vs. outright cancellation, etc.", "BULLET::::- Uncertainty is designed into games, most notably in gambling, where chance is central to play.\nBULLET::::- In scientific modelling, in which the prediction of future events should be understood to have a range of expected values\nBULLET::::- In optimization, uncertainty permits one to describe situations where the user does not have full control on the final outcome of the optimization procedure, see scenario optimization and stochastic optimization.\nBULLET::::- In weather forecasting, it is now commonplace to include data on the degree of uncertainty in a weather forecast.\nBULLET::::- Uncertainty or error is used in science and engineering notation. Numerical values should only have to be expressed in those digits that are physically meaningful, which are referred to as significant figures. Uncertainty is involved in every measurement, such as measuring a distance, a temperature, etc., the degree depending upon the instrument or technique used to make the measurement. Similarly, uncertainty is propagated through calculations so that the calculated value has some degree of uncertainty depending upon the uncertainties of the measured values and the equation used in the calculation.\nBULLET::::- In physics, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle forms the basis of modern quantum mechanics.\nBULLET::::- In metrology, measurement uncertainty is a central concept quantifying the dispersion one may reasonably attribute to a measurement result. Such an uncertainty can also be referred to as a measurement error. In daily life, measurement uncertainty is often implicit (\"He is 6 feet tall\" give or take a few inches), while for any serious use an explicit statement of the measurement uncertainty is necessary. The expected measurement uncertainty of many measuring instruments (scales, oscilloscopes, force gages, rulers, thermometers, etc.) is often stated in the manufacturers' specifications.\nBULLET::::- In engineering, uncertainty can be used in the context of validation and verification of material modeling.\nBULLET::::- Uncertainty has been a common theme in art, both as a thematic device (see, for example, the indecision of Hamlet), and as a quandary for the artist (such as Martin Creed's difficulty with deciding what artworks to make).\nBULLET::::- Uncertainty is an important factor in economics. According to economist Frank Knight, it is different from risk, where there is a specific probability assigned to each outcome (as when flipping a fair coin). Knightian uncertainty involves a situation that has unknown probabilities.\nBULLET::::- Investing in financial markets such as the stock market involves Knightian uncertainty when the probabiliy of a rare but catastrophic event is unknown."], "wikipedia-28565245": ["The concept of interpreting talk sets the foundation that allows individuals to interact in a safe space with knowledge that minimizes the potential of damaging a relationship. This is essential in platonic, romantic, family and professional relationships because they all are ongoing and integral to one\u2019s overall satisfaction in life.\n\nPrinciples from two theoretical studies help justify why individuals conduct themselves in a particular fashion while shedding light on how they go about it. One is the \"Uncertainty Reduction Theory,\" that argues people look to gain information about others, reducing uncertainty, with hopes of establishing healthy relationship where the benefits outweigh the costs This theory was created by Charles Berger and Richard Calabrese to understand the communication process between strangers that connected to our expectations since people are naturally inquisitive, social beings.\n\nThe studies of Uncertainty Reduction Theory evolved from only pertaining to the interaction of strangers and the expectations associated, if any, to the realization that it was evident in most forms of human communication. It is human nature to want to belong to something bigger than yourself so it\u2019s no coincidence that people subconsciously are looking to bond with others when given the opportunity, especially with your preferred sex. Therefore, after someone\u2019s attention is captured in an initial greeting, people tend to look for subtle cues to see if the other party is willing to continue, often seen as being friendly and welcoming. Duck states the continuation of these initial interactions as \u201cunfinished business\u201d that will last until the relationship ceases. On the contrary, rejection could lead to frustration that eventually could make your insecurities even worse. The theory states the three strategies people go about seeking information is: (1) \"Passive\" \u2013 observing them in their natural environment. (2) \"Interactive\" \u2013 directly communicating with the person. (3) \"Active\" \u2013 reaching out to others for the information and determining if the next step should be observing them passively or interactively communicating with them. In the social media era we live, a study was done that revealed the passive strategy, is the most commonly used but the interactive strategy reduces the most uncertainty. Information gained from these strategies not only reduces uncertainty but also increase the likelihood of predicting the others\u2019 next course of action. The behavior associated with these strategies is known as \u201cself-monitoring\u201d, where people strategically manipulate how they present themselves due to the information they have received.\n\nAs studies developed there have been other uncertainties related to oneself, their partner, and the relationship that stem from these behaviors. During self-uncertainty an individual\u2019s insecurity makes one question and start trying to seek information about their own past behaviors and predict what they should act going forward. This can be independent or derived from partner-uncertainty, where people try to figure out what problems have occurred that justify the other individual\u2019s behavior or feelings so they can be a better help to them. The last form is a combination of the two known as relationship uncertainty. This occurs when the lack of information about the source of relational issues and causes a disturbance because one can\u2019t thoroughly explain and", "Uncertainty reduction theory comes from the sociopsychological perspective. It addresses the basic process of how we gain knowledge about other people. According to the theory, people have difficulty with uncertainty. They want to be able to predict behavior, and therefore, they are motivated to seek more information about people.\nThe theory argues that strangers, upon meeting, go through certain steps and checkpoints in order to reduce uncertainty about each other and form an idea of whether one likes or dislikes the other. As we communicate, we are making plans to accomplish our goals.\nAt highly uncertain moments, we become more vigilant and rely more on data available in the situation. When we are less certain, we lose confidence in our own plans and make contingency plans. The theory also says that higher levels of uncertainty create distance between people and that non-verbal expressiveness tends to help reduce uncertainty.\nConstructs include level of uncertainty, nature of the relationship and ways to reduce uncertainty. Underlying assumptions include that an individual will cognitively process the existence of uncertainty and take steps to reduce it. The boundary conditions for this theory are that there must be some kind of outside social situation trigger and internal cognitive process.\nAccording to the theory, we reduce uncertainty in three ways:\nBULLET::::1. Passive strategies: observing the person.\nBULLET::::2. Active strategies: asking others about the person or looking up info.\nBULLET::::3. Interactive strategies: asking questions, self-disclosure."], "wikipedia-4839173": ["As a simple example, consider a worker with uncertain income. They expect to make $100 per week, while if they make under $60 they will be unable to afford lodging and will sleep in the street, and if they make over $150 they will be able to afford a night's entertainment.\n\nUsing the info-gap absolute error model:\nwhere formula_8 one would conclude that the worker's robustness function formula_9 is $40, and their opportuneness function formula_10 is $50: if they are certain that they will make $100, they will neither sleep in the street nor feast, and likewise if they make within $40 of $100.

This is demonstrated in Figure 6. If the uncertainty will increase, the envelope of uncertainty will become more inclusive, to include instances of the total revenue function that, for the specific allocation, yields a revenue smaller than the critical revenue.\nThe robustness measures the immunity of a decision to failure.

These guesser choices do not have to conform to any other information so far acquired about the chooser's identity (e.g. male, non-fictional, still alive).\nEach guesser asks the chooser a yes/no question using some detail of the guesser's choice. For example, if the letter is \"B\" then the guesser might choose Yul Brynner and ask, \"Are you bald?\" At this point, the chooser has three possible responses:\nBULLET::::1. \"No, I am not \"Frank Black\".\" \u2014 The chooser has either guessed the guesser's chosen person, or has thought of another person who fits the same criteria.

Direct mode continues until the chooser answers \"no\" to a question.\nIf the chooser does not know the answer to a direct mode question, or the question does not permit a clear-cut yes/no answer, then the chooser answers as accurately as possible, and the game remains in direct mode. There are some conventions for answering contextually inappropriate direct mode questions; for example, fictional characters are usually deemed to be dead if their death has been recorded.\n\nSome variants allow only a single direct mode question before returning to indirect mode, regardless of the answer, as the reward for the guesser. Coupled with the confirmation requirement, this allows for long, intellectual games."], "wikipedia-42324": ["Goodman thought that there are four \"cueing systems\" for reading, four things that readers have to guess what word comes next:\nBULLET::::1. graphophonemic: the shapes of the letters, and the sounds that they evoke (see phonetics).\nBULLET::::2. semantic: what word one would expect to occur based on the meaning of the sentence so far (see semantics).\nBULLET::::3. syntactic: what part of speech or word would make sense based on the grammar of the language (see syntax).\nBULLET::::4. pragmatic: what is the function of the text\nThe \"graph\" part of the word \"graphophonemic\" means the shape or symbol of the graphic input, i.e., the text. According to Goodman, these systems work together to help readers guess the right word. He emphasized that pronouncing individual words will involve the use of all three systems (letter clues, meaning clues from context, and syntactical structure of the sentence).\nThe graphophonemic cues are related to the sounds we hear (the phonological system including individual letters and letter combinations), the letters of the alphabet, and the conventions of spelling, punctuation and print. Students who are emerging readers use these cues considerably. However, in the English language there is a very imprecise relationship between written symbols and sound symbols. Sometimes the relationships and their patterns do not work, as in the example of \"great\" and \"head\". Proficient readers and writers draw on their prior experiences with text and the other cueing systems, as well as the phonological system, as their reading and writing develops. Ken Goodman writes that, \"The cue systems are used simultaneously and interdependently. What constitutes useful graphic information depends on how much syntactic and semantic information is available. Within high contextual constraints an initial consonant may be all that is needed to identify an element and make possible the prediction of an ensuing sequence or the confirmation of prior predictions.\" He continues with, \"Reading requires not so much skills as strategies that make it possible to select the most productive cues.\" He believes that reading involves the interrelationship of all the language systems. Readers sample and make judgments about which cues from each system will provide the most useful information in making predictions that will get them to meaning.\nGoodman provides a partial list of the various systems readers use as they interact with text. Within the graphophonemic system there are:\nBULLET::::- Letter-sound relationships\nBULLET::::- Shape (or word configuration)\nBULLET::::- Know \u2018little words\u2019 in bigger words\nBULLET::::- Whole know words\nBULLET::::- Recurrent spelling patterns\nThe semantic cuing system is the one in which meaning is constructed. \"So focused is reading on making sense that the visual input, the perceptions we form, and the syntactic patterns we assign are all directed by our meaning construction.\" The key component of the semantic system is context. A reader must be able to attach meaning to words and have some prior knowledge to use as a context for understanding the word. They must be able to relate the newly learned word to prior knowledge through personal associations with text and the structure of text.\nThe semantic system is developed from the beginning through early interactions with adults. At first, this usually involves labeling (e.g. This is a dog). Then labeling becomes more detailed (e.g., It is a Labrador dog. Its coat is black.) The child learns that there is a set of \"dog attributes\" and that within the category \"dog\", there are subsets of \"dog\" (e.g. long-hair, short-hair). The development of this system and the development of the important concepts that relate to the system are largely accomplished as children begin to explore language independently. As children speak about what they\u2019ve done and play out their experiences, they are making personal associations between their experiences and language. This is critical to success in later literacy practices such as reading comprehension and writing. The meaning people bring to the reading is available to them through every cuing system, but it\u2019s particularly influential as we move from our sense of the syntactic patterns to the semantic structures.\nTo support the reader in developing the semantic system, ask, \"Does that make sense\"?\nThe syntactic system, according to Goodman and Watson, includes the interrelation of words and sentences within connected text. In the English language, syntactic relations include word order, tense, number, and gender. The syntactic system is also concerned with word parts that change the meaning of a word, called morphemes. For example, adding the suffix \"less\" or adding \"s\" to the end of a word changes its meaning or tense. As speakers of English, people know where to place subjects, which pronoun to use and where adjectives occur. Individual word meaning is determined by the place of the word in"], "wikipedia-227145": ["Players take turns: on a player's turn, they guess some five-letter word, and the other player announces how many letters in that guess match a unique letter in their secret word.

This is the situation of maximum uncertainty as it is most difficult to predict the outcome of the next toss; the result of each toss of the coin delivers one full bit of information. This is because\nHowever, if we know the coin is not fair, but comes up heads or tails with probabilities and , where , then there is less uncertainty.

The reduced uncertainty is quantified in a lower entropy: on average each toss of the coin delivers less than one full bit of information. For example, if =0.7, then\n\nUniform probability yields maximum uncertainty and therefore maximum entropy. Entropy, then, can only decrease from the value associated with uniform probability. The extreme case is that of a double-headed coin that never comes up tails, or a double-tailed coin that never results in a head. Then there is no uncertainty. The entropy is zero: each toss of the coin delivers no new information as the outcome of each coin toss is always certain.\n\nTo understand the meaning of , first define an information function in terms of an event with probability . The amount of information acquired due to the observation of event follows from Shannon's solution of the fundamental properties of information:\nBULLET::::1. is monotonically decreasing in \u2013 an increase in the probability of an event decreases the information from an observed event, and vice versa.\nBULLET::::2. \u2013 information is a non-negative quantity.\nBULLET::::3. \u2013 events that always occur do not communicate information.\nBULLET::::4. \u2013 information due to independent events is additive.\nThe last is a crucial property. It states that joint probability of independent sources of information communicates as much information as the two individual events separately. Particularly, if the first event can yield one of equiprobable outcomes and another has one of equiprobable outcomes then there are possible outcomes of the joint event. This means that if bits are needed to encode the first value and to encode the second, one needs to encode both. Shannon discovered that the proper choice of function to quantify information, preserving this additivity, is logarithmic, i.e.,\nlet formula_30 be the information function which one assumes to be twice continuously differentiable, one has:\nThis differential equation leads to the solution formula_32 for any formula_33. Condition 2. leads to formula_34 and especially, formula_35 can be chosen on the form formula_36 with formula_37, which is equivalent to choosing a specific base for the logarithm. The different units of information (bits for the binary logarithm , nats for the natural logarithm , bans for the decimal logarithm and so on) are constant multiples of each other. For instance, in case of a fair coin toss, heads provides bit of information, which is approximately 0.693 nats or 0.301 decimal digits. Because of additivity, tosses provide bits of information, which is approximately nats or decimal digits.\nIf there is a distribution where event can happen with probability , and it is sampled times with an outcome occurring times, the total amount of information we have received is \nThe \"average\" amount of information that we receive per event is therefore"], "wikipedia-3325140": ["Mathematically \"H\" may also be seen as an average information, taken over the message space, because when a certain message occurs with probability \"p\", the information quantity \u2212log(\"p\") will be obtained.\n\nMoreover, a direct connection can be made between the two.

The concept of \"bits\" quantifies this reduction, where 1 bit represents the information gained when uncertainty is halved (e.g., a yes/no question). Entropy measures initial uncertainty, and the difference after observation gives the information in bits.", "wikipedia-15445": ["The measure of information entropy associated with each possible data value is the negative logarithm of the probability mass function for the value: \nWhen the data source produces a low-probability value (i.e., when a low-probability event occurs), the event carries more \"information\" (\"surprisal\") than when the source data produces a high-probability value. The amount of information conveyed by each event defined in this way becomes a random variable whose expected value is the information entropy. Generally, \"entropy\" refers to disorder or uncertainty, and the definition of entropy used in information theory is directly analogous to the definition used in statistical thermodynamics. The concept of information entropy was introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\".\nInformation entropy is typically measured in bits (alternatively called \"shannons\") or sometimes in \"natural units\" (nats) or decimal digits (called \"dits\", \"bans\", or \"hartleys\"). The unit of the measurement depends on the base of the logarithm that is used to define the entropy.\nThe logarithm of the probability distribution is useful as a measure of entropy because it is additive for independent sources. For instance, the entropy of a fair coin toss is 1 bit, and the entropy of tosses is bits. In a straightforward representation, bits are needed to represent a variable that can take one of values if is a power of 2. If these values are equally probable, the entropy (in bits) is equal to . If one of the values is more probable to occur than the others, an observation that this value occurs is less informative than if some less common outcome had occurred. Conversely, rarer events provide more information when observed. Since observation of less probable events occurs more rarely, the net effect is that the entropy (thought of as average information) received from non-uniformly distributed data is always less than or equal to . Entropy is zero when one outcome is certain to occur. The entropy quantifies these considerations when a probability distribution of the source data is known. The \"meaning\" of the events observed (the meaning of \"messages\") does not matter in the definition of entropy. Entropy only takes into account the probability of observing a specific event, so the information it encapsulates is information about the underlying probability distribution, not the meaning of the events themselves.\nThe basic idea of information theory is that the \"news value\" of a communicated message depends on the degree to which the content of the message is surprising. If an event is very probable, it is no surprise (and generally uninteresting) when that event happens as expected. However, if an event is unlikely to occur, it is much more informative to learn that the event happened or will happen. For instance, the knowledge that some particular number \"will not\" be the winning number of a lottery provides very little information, because any particular chosen number will almost certainly not win. However, knowledge that a particular number \"will\" win a lottery has high value because it communicates the outcome of a very low probability event. The information content (also called the \"surprisal\") of an event formula_2 is an increasing function of the reciprocal of the probability formula_3 of the event, precisely formula_4. Entropy measures the expected (i.e., average) amount of information conveyed by identifying the outcome of a random trial. This implies that casting a die has higher entropy than tossing a coin because each outcome of a die toss has smaller probability (about formula_5) than each outcome of a coin toss (formula_6).\nEntropy is a measure of the \"unpredictability\" of the state, or equivalently, of its \"average information content\". To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the poll is not already known. In other words, the outcome of the poll is relatively \"unpredictable\", and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new \"information\"; these are just different ways of saying that the \"a priori\" entropy of the poll results is large. Now, consider the case that the same poll is performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first poll is already known, the outcome of the second poll can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the \"a priori\" entropy of the second poll result is small relative to that of the first.\nConsider the example of a coin toss. If the probability of heads is the same as the probability of tails, then the entropy of the coin toss is as high as it could be for a two-outcome trial. There is no way to predict the outcome of the coin toss ahead of time: if one has to choose, there is no average advantage to be gained by predicting that the toss will come up heads or tails, as either prediction will be correct with probability formula_7. Such a coin toss has one bit of entropy since there are two possible outcomes that occur with equal probability, and learning the actual outcome contains one bit of information. In contrast, a coin toss using a coin that has two heads and no tails has zero entropy since the coin will always come up heads, and the outcome can be predicted perfectly. Analogously, a binary event with equiprobable outcomes has a Shannon entropy of formula_8 bit. Similarly, one trit with equiprobable values contains formula_9 (about 1.58496) bits of information because it can have one of three values.", "The entropy of the unknown result of the next toss of the coin is maximized if the coin is fair (that is, if heads and tails both have equal probability 1/2). This is the situation of maximum uncertainty as it is most difficult to predict the outcome of the next toss; the result of each toss of the coin delivers one full bit of information. This is because\n\nHowever, if we know the coin is not fair, but comes up heads or tails with probabilities and , where , then there is less uncertainty. Every time it is tossed, one side is more likely to come up than the other. The reduced uncertainty is quantified in a lower entropy: on average each toss of the coin delivers less than one full bit of information. For example, if =0.7, then\n\nUniform probability yields maximum uncertainty and therefore maximum entropy. Entropy, then, can only decrease from the value associated with uniform probability. The extreme case is that of a double-headed coin that never comes up tails, or a double-tailed coin that never results in a head. Then there is no uncertainty. The entropy is zero: each toss of the coin delivers no new information as the outcome of each coin toss is always certain."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-5987648": 1, "wikipedia-2661638": 1, "wikipedia-593908": 1, "wikipedia-15445": 2, "wikipedia-23145199": 1, "wikipedia-15855253": 1, "wikipedia-21171254": 1, "wikipedia-3325140": 1, "wikipedia-9006975": 1, "wikipedia-26945226": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-5987648": 1, "wikipedia-2661638": 1, "wikipedia-593908": 1, "wikipedia-15445": 3, "wikipedia-23145199": 1, "wikipedia-15855253": 1, "wikipedia-21171254": 1, "wikipedia-3325140": 2, "wikipedia-9006975": 1, "wikipedia-26945226": 1}}}

The idea of \"irreversibility\" is central to the understanding of entropy. Everyone has an intuitive understanding of irreversibility. If one watches a movie of everyday life running forward and in reverse, it is easy to distinguish between the two. The movie running in reverse shows impossible things happening \u2013 water jumping out of a glass into a pitcher above it, smoke going down a chimney, water in a glass freezing to form ice cubes, crashed cars reassembling themselves, and so on. The intuitive meaning of expressions such as \"you can't unscramble an egg\", or \"you can't take the cream out of the coffee\" is that these are irreversible processes. No matter how long you wait, the cream won't jump out of the coffee into the creamer.\nIn thermodynamics, one says that the \"forward\" processes \u2013 pouring water from a pitcher, smoke going up a chimney, etc. \u2013 are \"irreversible\": they cannot happen in reverse. All real physical processes involving systems in everyday life, with many atoms or molecules, are irreversible. For an irreversible process in an isolated system (a system not subject to outside influence), the thermodynamic state variable known as entropy is never decreasing. In everyday life, there may be processes in which the increase of entropy is practically unobservable, almost zero. In these cases, a movie of the process run in reverse will not seem unlikely. For example, in a 1-second video of the collision of two billiard balls, it will be hard to distinguish the forward and the backward case, because the increase of entropy during that time is relatively small. In thermodynamics, one says that this process is practically \"reversible\", with an entropy increase that is practically zero. The statement of the fact that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases is known as the second law of thermodynamics.\nClassical thermodynamics is a physical theory which describes a \"system\" in terms of the thermodynamic variables of the system or its parts. Some thermodynamic variables are familiar: temperature, pressure, volume. Entropy is a thermodynamic variable which is less familiar and not as easily understood. A \"system\" is any region of space containing matter and energy: A cup of coffee, a glass of icewater, an automobile, an egg. Thermodynamic variables do not give a \"complete\" picture of the system. Thermodynamics makes no assumptions about the microscopic nature of a system and does not describe nor does it take into account the positions and velocities of the individual atoms and molecules which make up the system. Thermodynamics deals with matter in a macroscopic sense; it would be valid even if the atomic theory of matter were wrong. This is an important quality, because it means that reasoning based on thermodynamics is unlikely to require alteration as new facts about atomic structure and atomic interactions are found. The essence of thermodynamics is embodied in the four laws of thermodynamics.\nUnfortunately, thermodynamics provides little insight into what is happening at a microscopic level. Statistical mechanics is a physical theory which explains thermodynamics in microscopic terms. It explains thermodynamics in terms of the possible detailed microscopic situations the system may be in when the thermodynamic variables of the system are known. These are known as \"microstates\" whereas the description of the system in thermodynamic terms specifies the \"macrostate\" of the system. Many different microstates can yield the same macrostate. It is important to understand that statistical mechanics does not define temperature, pressure, entropy, etc. They are already defined by thermodynamics. Statistical mechanics serves to explain thermodynamics in terms of microscopic behavior of the atoms and molecules in the system.\nIn statistical mechanics, the entropy of a system is described as a measure of how many different microstates there are that could give rise to the macrostate that the system is in. The entropy of the system is given by Ludwig Boltzmann's famous equation: where \"S\" is the entropy of the macrostate, \"k\" is Boltzmann's constant, and \"W\" is the total number of possible microstates that might yield the macrostate. The concept of irreversibility stems from the idea that if you have a system in an \"unlikely\" macrostate (log(\"W\" ) is relatively small) it will soon move to the \"most likely\" macrostate (with larger log(\"W\" )) and the entropy \"S\" will increase. A glass of warm water with an ice cube in it is unlikely to just happen, it must have been recently created, and the system will move to a more likely macrostate in which the ice cube is partially or entirely melted and the water is cooled. Statistical mechanics shows that the number of microstates which give ice and warm water is much smaller than the number of microstates that give the reduced ice mass and cooler water."], "wikipedia-4700845": ["Entropy is a property of thermodynamical systems. The term entropy was introduced by Rudolf Clausius who named it from the Greek word \u03c4\u03c1o\u03c0\u03ae, \"transformation\". He considered transfers of energy as heat and work between bodies of matter, taking temperature into account. Bodies of radiation are also covered by the same kind of reasoning.\n\nLudwig Boltzmann explained the entropy as a measure of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) which comply with the macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. Boltzmann then went on to show that was equal to the thermodynamic entropy.\n\nIn a thermodynamic system, differences in pressure, density, and temperature all tend to equalize over time. For example, consider a room containing a glass of melting ice as one system. The difference in temperature between the warm room and the cold glass of ice and water is equalized as heat from the room is transferred to the cooler ice and water mixture. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room achieve balance. The entropy of the room has decreased. However, the entropy of the glass of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the room has decreased. In an isolated system, such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler regions always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the system of the room and ice water system has reached temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at its maximum. The entropy of the thermodynamic system is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nFrom a \"macroscopic perspective\", in classical thermodynamics, the entropy is a state function of a thermodynamic system: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. Entropy is a key ingredient of the Second law of thermodynamics, which has important consequences e.g. for the performance of heat engines, refrigerators, and heat pumps."], "wikipedia-9891": ["In statistical mechanics, entropy is an extensive property of a thermodynamic system. It is closely related to the number of microscopic configurations (known as microstates) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy formula_1 is the natural logarithm of the number of microstates, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant . Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number of possible microscopic configurations. For example, the entropy of an ideal gas is proportional to the number of gas molecules . The number of molecules in twenty liters of gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is roughly (the Avogadro number). At equilibrium, each of the configurations can be regarded as random and equally likely.\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Such systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy increases. Entropy is a function of the state of the system, so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is reversible, the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of the lack of information about it. The concept of entropy plays a central role in information theory.", "The thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by Rudolf Clausius and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an isolated system in thermodynamic equilibrium with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the Carnot cycle. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its absolute temperature). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a function of state, specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nThe statistical definition was developed by Ludwig Boltzmann in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor which has since been known as Boltzmann's constant. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics is the measure of uncertainty, or \"mixedupness\" in the phrase of Gibbs, which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible microstates. In contrast to the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways in which a system may be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder). This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) which could give rise to the observed macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the Boltzmann constant.", "Entropy arises directly from the Carnot cycle. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state. In a thermodynamic system, pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the equilibrium state has higher probability (more possible combinations of microstates) than any other state. As an example, for a glass of ice water in air at room temperature, the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the thermal energy from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water. However, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an isolated system such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the 'universe' of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the thermodynamic system is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed. Thermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved state function that is of great importance in the sciences of physics and chemistry. Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their time reversals (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy. For isolated systems, entropy never decreases. This fact has several important consequences in science: first, it prohibits 'perpetual motion' machines; and second, it implies the arrow of entropy has the same direction as the arrow of time. Increases in entropy correspond to irreversible changes in a system, because some energy is expended as waste heat, limiting the amount of work a system can do.", "Entropy is equally essential in predicting the extent and direction of complex chemical reactions. For such applications, \u0394\"S\" must be incorporated in an expression that includes both the system and its surroundings, \u0394\"S\" = \u0394\"S\" + \u0394\"S\". This expression becomes, via some steps, the Gibbs free energy equation for reactants and products in the system: \u0394\"G\" [the Gibbs free energy change of the system] = \u0394\"H\" [the enthalpy change] \u2212 \"T\" \u0394\"S\" [the entropy change].\n\nAs a fundamental aspect of thermodynamics and physics, several different approaches to entropy beyond that of Clausius and Boltzmann are valid.\n\nThe following is a list of additional definitions of entropy from a collection of textbooks:\nBULLET::::- a measure of energy dispersal at a specific temperature.\nBULLET::::- a measure of disorder in the universe or of the availability of the energy in a system to do work.\nBULLET::::- a measure of a system's thermal energy per unit temperature that is unavailable for doing useful work.\n\nIn Boltzmann's definition, entropy is a measure of the number of possible microscopic states (or microstates) of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Consistent with the Boltzmann definition, the second law of thermodynamics needs to be re-worded as such that entropy increases over time, though the underlying principle remains the same.\n\nEntropy has often been loosely associated with the amount of order or disorder, or of chaos, in a thermodynamic system. The traditional qualitative description of entropy is that it refers to changes in the status quo of the system and is a measure of \"molecular disorder\" and the amount of wasted energy in a dynamical energy transformation from one state or form to another.\n\nThe concept of entropy can be described qualitatively as a measure of energy dispersal at a specific temperature. Similar terms have been in use from early in the history of classical thermodynamics, and with the development of statistical thermodynamics and quantum theory, entropy changes have been described in terms of the mixing or \"spreading\" of the total energy of each constituent of a system over its particular quantized energy levels."], "wikipedia-7319263": ["In this alternative approach, entropy is a measure of energy \"dispersal\" or \"distribution\" at a specific temperature. Changes in entropy can be quantitatively related to the distribution or the spreading out of the energy of a thermodynamic system, divided by its temperature.\n\nEntropy can be described in terms of \"energy dispersal\" and the \"spreading of energy,\" while avoiding all mention of \"disorder\" and \"chaos\" except when explaining misconceptions. All explanations of where and how energy is dispersing or spreading have been recast in terms of energy dispersal, so as to emphasise the underlying qualitative meaning.\n\nIn this approach, the second law of thermodynamics is introduced as \"Energy spontaneously disperses from being localized to becoming spread out if it is not hindered from doing so,\" often in the context of common experiences such as a rock falling, a hot frying pan cooling down, iron rusting, air leaving a punctured tyre and ice melting in a warm room. Entropy is then depicted as a sophisticated kind of \"before and after\" yardstick \u2014 measuring how much energy is spread out over time as a result of a process such as heating a system, or how widely spread out the energy is after something happens in comparison with its previous state, in a process such as gas expansion or fluids mixing (at a constant temperature). The equations are explored with reference to the common experiences, with emphasis that in chemistry the energy that entropy measures as dispersing is the internal energy of molecules.\n\nThe statistical interpretation is related to quantum mechanics in describing the way that energy is distributed (quantized) amongst molecules on specific energy levels, with all the energy of the macrostate always in only one microstate at one instant. Entropy is described as measuring the energy dispersal for a system by the number of accessible microstates, the number of different arrangements of all its energy at the next instant. Thus, an increase in entropy means a greater number of microstates for the final state than for the initial state, and hence more possible arrangements of a system's total energy at any one instant. Here, the greater 'dispersal of the total energy of a system' means the existence of many possibilities.\n\nBy virtue of the First law of thermodynamics, the total energy does not change; instead, the energy tends to disperse over the space to which it has access."], "wikipedia-20647050": ["One statement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics is that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. This statement helps to define temperature but it does not, by itself, complete the definition. An empirical temperature is a numerical scale for the hotness of a thermodynamic system. Such hotness may be defined as existing on a one-dimensional manifold, stretching between hot and cold. Sometimes the zeroth law is stated to include the existence of a unique universal hotness manifold, and of numerical scales on it, so as to provide a complete definition of empirical temperature. To be suitable for empirical thermometry, a material must have a monotonic relation between hotness and some easily measured state variable, such as pressure or volume, when all other relevant coordinates are fixed. An exceptionally suitable system is the ideal gas, which can provide a temperature scale that matches the absolute Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale is defined on the basis of the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn the previous section certain properties of temperature were expressed by the zeroth law of thermodynamics. It is also possible to define temperature in terms of the second law of thermodynamics which deals with entropy. The second law states that any process will result in either no change or a net increase in the entropy of the universe. This can be understood in terms of probability.\n\nFor example, in a series of coin tosses, a perfectly ordered system would be one in which either every toss comes up heads or every toss comes up tails. This means that for a perfectly ordered set of coin tosses, there is only one set of toss outcomes possible: the set in which 100% of tosses come up the same. On the other hand, there are multiple combinations that can result in disordered or mixed systems, where some fraction are heads and the rest tails. A disordered system can be 90% heads and 10% tails, or it could be 98% heads and 2% tails, etcetera. As the number of coin tosses increases, the number of possible combinations corresponding to imperfectly ordered systems increases. For a very large number of coin tosses, the combinations to ~50% heads and ~50% tails dominate and obtaining an outcome significantly different from 50/50 becomes extremely unlikely. Thus the system naturally progresses to a state of maximum disorder or entropy.\n\nIt has been previously stated that temperature governs the transfer of heat between two systems and it was just shown that the universe tends to progress so as to maximize entropy, which is expected of any natural system. Thus, it is expected that there is some relationship between temperature and entropy."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

These resources can effectively address the audience's need for a clear, foundational understanding.", "wikipedia-7592567": ["Entropy is an important concept in the branch of physics known as thermodynamics. The idea of \"irreversibility\" is central to the understanding of entropy. Everyone has an intuitive understanding of irreversibility. If one watches a movie of everyday life running forward and in reverse, it is easy to distinguish between the two. The movie running in reverse shows impossible things happening \u2013 water jumping out of a glass into a pitcher above it, smoke going down a chimney, water in a glass freezing to form ice cubes, crashed cars reassembling themselves, and so on. The intuitive meaning of expressions such as \"you can't unscramble an egg\", or \"you can't take the cream out of the coffee\" is that these are irreversible processes. No matter how long you wait, the cream won't jump out of the coffee into the creamer.\nIn thermodynamics, one says that the \"forward\" processes \u2013 pouring water from a pitcher, smoke going up a chimney, etc. \u2013 are \"irreversible\": they cannot happen in reverse. All real physical processes involving systems in everyday life, with many atoms or molecules, are irreversible. For an irreversible process in an isolated system (a system not subject to outside influence), the thermodynamic state variable known as entropy is never decreasing. In everyday life, there may be processes in which the increase of entropy is practically unobservable, almost zero. In these cases, a movie of the process run in reverse will not seem unlikely. For example, in a 1-second video of the collision of two billiard balls, it will be hard to distinguish the forward and the backward case, because the increase of entropy during that time is relatively small. In thermodynamics, one says that this process is practically \"reversible\", with an entropy increase that is practically zero. The statement of the fact that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases is known as the second law of thermodynamics.\nClassical thermodynamics is a physical theory which describes a \"system\" in terms of the thermodynamic variables of the system or its parts. Some thermodynamic variables are familiar: temperature, pressure, volume. Entropy is a thermodynamic variable which is less familiar and not as easily understood. A \"system\" is any region of space containing matter and energy: A cup of coffee, a glass of icewater, an automobile, an egg. Thermodynamic variables do not give a \"complete\" picture of the system. Thermodynamics makes no assumptions about the microscopic nature of a system and does not describe nor does it take into account the positions and velocities of the individual atoms and molecules which make up the system. Thermodynamics deals with matter in a macroscopic sense; it would be valid even if the atomic theory of matter were wrong. This is an important quality, because it means that reasoning based on thermodynamics is unlikely to require alteration as new facts about atomic structure and atomic interactions are found. The essence of thermodynamics is embodied in the four laws of thermodynamics.\nUnfortunately, thermodynamics provides little insight into what is happening at a microscopic level. Statistical mechanics is a physical theory which explains thermodynamics in microscopic terms. It explains thermodynamics in terms of the possible detailed microscopic situations the system may be in when the thermodynamic variables of the system are known. These are known as \"microstates\" whereas the description of the system in thermodynamic terms specifies the \"macrostate\" of the system. Many different microstates can yield the same macrostate. It is important to understand that statistical mechanics does not define temperature, pressure, entropy, etc. They are already defined by thermodynamics. Statistical mechanics serves to explain thermodynamics in terms of microscopic behavior of the atoms and molecules in the system.\nIn statistical mechanics, the entropy of a system is described as a measure of how many different microstates there are that could give rise to the macrostate that the system is in. The entropy of the system is given by Ludwig Boltzmann's famous equation:\nwhere \"S\" is the entropy of the macrostate, \"k\" is Boltzmann's constant, and \"W\" is the total number of possible microstates that might yield the macrostate. The concept of irreversibility stems from the idea that if you have a system in an \"unlikely\" macrostate (log(\"W\" ) is relatively small) it will soon move to the \"most likely\" macrostate (with larger log(\"W\" )) and the entropy \"S\" will increase. A glass of warm water with an ice cube in it is unlikely to just happen, it must have been recently created, and the system will move to a more likely macrostate in which the ice cube is partially or entirely melted and the water is cooled. Statistical mechanics shows that the number of microstates which give ice and warm water is much smaller than the number of microstates that give the reduced ice mass and cooler water.\nSection::::Explanation.\nThe concept of thermodynamic entropy arises from the second law of thermodynamics. This law of entropy increase quantifies the reduction in the capacity of a system for change or determines whether a thermodynamic process may occur. For example, heat always flows from a region of higher temperature to one with lower temperature until temperature becomes uniform.\nEntropy is calculated in two ways, the first is the entropy change (\u0394S) to a system containing a sub-system which undergoes heat transfer to its surroundings (inside the system of interest). It is based on the macroscopic relationship between heat flow into the sub-system and the temperature at which it occurs summed over the boundary of that sub-system. The second calculates the absolute entropy (S) of a system based on the microscopic behaviour of its individual particles. This is based on the natural logarithm of the number of microstates possible in a particular macrostate (W or \u03a9) called the thermodynamic probability. Roughly, it gives the probability of the system's being in that state. In this sense it effectively defines entropy independently from its effects due to changes which may involve heat, mechanical, electrical, chemical energies etc. but also includes logical states such as information.\nFollowing the formalism of Clausius, the first calculation can be mathematically stated as:\nBULLET::::- \u201cReversible\u201d or \u201creversibly\u201d (rev) simply means that T, the temperature of the system, has to stay (almost) exactly the same while any energy is being transferred to or from it. That\u2019s easy in the case of phase changes, where the system absolutely must stay in the solid or liquid form until enough energy is given to it to break bonds between the molecules before it can change to a liquid or a gas. For example, in the melting of ice at 273.15 K, no matter what temperature the surroundings are \u2013 from 273.20 K to 500 K or even higher, the temperature of the ice will stay at 273.15 K until the last molecules in the ice are changed to liquid water, i.e., until all the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules in ice are broken and new, less-exactly fixed hydrogen bonds between liquid water molecules are formed. This amount of energy necessary for ice melting per mole has been found to be 6008 joules at 273 K. Therefore, the entropy change per mole is formula_3, or 22 J/K.\nBULLET::::- When the temperature isn't at the melting or boiling point of a substance no intermolecular bond-breaking is possible, and so any motional molecular energy (\u201cheat\u201d) from the surroundings transferred to a system raises its temperature, making its molecules move faster and faster. As the temperature is constantly rising, there is no longer a particular value of \u201cT\u201d at which energy is transferred. However, a \"reversible\" energy transfer can be measured at a very small temperature increase, and a cumulative total can be found by adding each of many small temperature intervals or increments. For example, to find the entropy change formula_4 from 300 K to 310 K, measure the amount of energy transferred at dozens or hundreds of temperature increments, say from 300.00 K to 300.01 K and then 300.01 to 300.02 and so on, dividing the q by each T, and finally adding them all.\nBULLET::::- Calculus can be used to make this calculation easier if the effect of energy input to the system is linearly dependent on the temperature change, as in simple heating of a system at moderate to relatively high temperatures. Thus, the energy being transferred \u201cper incremental change in temperature\u201d (the heat capacity, formula_5), multiplied by the integral of formula_6 from formula_7 to formula_8, is directly given by formula_9.\nSection::::Introductory descriptions of entropy.\nBULLET::::- As a measure of disorder: Traditionally, 20th century textbooks have introduced entropy as order and disorder so that it provides \"a measurement of the disorder or randomness of a system\". It has been argued that ambiguities in the terms used (such as \"disorder\" and \"chaos\") contribute to widespread confusion and can hinder comprehension of entropy for most students. On the other hand, \"disorder\" may be very clearly defined as the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of microstates given a particular macrostate, in which case the connection of \"disorder\" to thermodynamic entropy is straightforward, but not immediately obvious to anyone unfamiliar with information theory.\nBULLET::::- Energy dispersal: A more recent formulation associated with Frank L. Lambert describes entropy as energy dispersal. As with \"disorder\", the meaning of the term \"dispersal\" must be taken in a very specific way, which is quite different than the lay meaning of \"dispersal\". While an increase in entropy is often associated with a spatial reduction in the concentration of the"], "wikipedia-133017": ["The first law of thermodynamics provides the basic definition of internal energy, associated with all thermodynamic systems, and states the rule of conservation of energy. The second law is concerned with the direction of natural processes. It asserts that a natural process runs only in one sense, and is not reversible. For example, heat always flows spontaneously from hotter to colder bodies, and never the reverse, unless external work is performed on the system. The explanation of the phenomena was given in terms of entropy. Total entropy (\"S\") can never decrease over time for an isolated system because the entropy of an isolated system spontaneously evolves toward thermodynamic equilibrium: the entropy should stay the same or increase."], "wikipedia-4700845": ["Entropy is a property of thermodynamical systems. The term entropy was introduced by Rudolf Clausius who named it from the Greek word \u03c4\u03c1o\u03c0\u03ae, \"transformation\". He considered transfers of energy as heat and work between bodies of matter, taking temperature into account. Bodies of radiation are also covered by the same kind of reasoning.\nMore recently, it has been recognized that the quantity 'entropy' can be derived by considering the actually possible thermodynamic processes simply from the point of view of their irreversibility, not relying on temperature for the reasoning.\nLudwig Boltzmann explained the entropy as a measure of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) which comply with the macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. Boltzmann then went on to show that was equal to the thermodynamic entropy. The factor has since been known as Boltzmann's constant.\nSection::::Introduction.\nIn a thermodynamic system, differences in pressure, density, and temperature all tend to equalize over time. For example, consider a room containing a glass of melting ice as one system. The difference in temperature between the warm room and the cold glass of ice and water is equalized as heat from the room is transferred to the cooler ice and water mixture. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room achieve balance. The entropy of the room has decreased. However, the entropy of the glass of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the room has decreased. In an isolated system, such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler regions always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the system of the room and ice water system has reached temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at its maximum. The entropy of the thermodynamic system is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\nThere are many irreversible processes that result in an increase of the entropy. See: Entropy production. One of them is mixing of two or more different substances, occasioned by bringing them together by removing a wall that separates them, keeping the temperature and pressure constant. The mixing is accompanied by the entropy of mixing. In the important case of mixing of ideal gases, the combined system does not change its internal energy by work or heat transfer; the entropy increase is then entirely due to the spreading of the different substances into their new common volume.\nFrom a \"macroscopic perspective\", in classical thermodynamics, the entropy is a state function of a thermodynamic system: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. Entropy is a key ingredient of the Second law of thermodynamics, which has important consequences e.g. for the performance of heat engines, refrigerators, and heat pumps."], "wikipedia-302133": ["Entropy, in thermodynamics, is a state function originally introduced to explain why part of a thermodynamic system's total energy is unavailable to do useful work.\nBULLET::::- Introduction to entropy an explanation on entropy as a measure of irreversibility\nBULLET::::- Entropy (order and disorder) an explanation of what heat and work have to do with disorder\nBULLET::::- Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory, the relationship between thermodynamic entropy and information (Shannon) entropy\nBULLET::::- Entropy (energy dispersal), dispersal of energy as a descriptor of entropy"], "wikipedia-9891": ["In statistical mechanics, entropy is an extensive property of a thermodynamic system. It is closely related to the number of microscopic configurations (known as microstates) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy formula_1 is the natural logarithm of the number of microstates, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant . Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number of possible microscopic configurations. For example, the entropy of an ideal gas is proportional to the number of gas molecules . The number of molecules in twenty liters of gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is roughly (the Avogadro number). At equilibrium, each of the configurations can be regarded as random and equally likely.\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Such systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy increases. Entropy is a function of the state of the system, so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is reversible, the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of the lack of information about it. The concept of entropy plays a central role in information theory.\nBoltzmann's constant, and therefore entropy, have dimensions of energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of joules per kelvin (J\u22c5K) in the International System of Units (or kg\u22c5m\u22c5s\u22c5K in terms of base units). The entropy of a substance is usually given as an intensive propertyeither entropy per unit mass (SI unit: J\u22c5K\u22c5kg) or entropy per unit amount of substance (SI unit: J\u22c5K\u22c5mol).\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics, deduced from the heat-friction experiments of James Joule in 1843, expresses the concept of energy, and its conservation in all processes; the first law, however, is unable to quantify the effects of friction and dissipation.\nIn the 1850s and 1860s, German physicist Rudolf Clausius objected to the supposition that no change occurs in the working body, and gave this \"change\" a mathematical interpretation by questioning the nature of the inherent loss of usable heat when work is done, e.g. heat produced by friction. Clausius described entropy as the \"transformation-content\", i.e. dissipative energy use, of a thermodynamic system or working body of chemical species during a change of state. This was in contrast to earlier views, based on the theories of Isaac Newton, that heat was an indestructible particle that had mass.\nLater, scientists such as Ludwig Boltzmann, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and James Clerk Maxwell gave entropy a statistical basis. In 1877 Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of ideal gas particles, in which he defined entropy to be proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy. Henceforth, the essential problem in statistical thermodynamics has been to determine the distribution of a given amount of energy \"E\" over \"N\" identical systems.\n\nThere are two equivalent definitions of entropy: the thermodynamic definition and the statistical mechanics definition. Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the classical thermodynamics viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium, although more recently attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in nonequilibrium systems as well. \nThe statistical definition of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, phonons, spins, etc.). \n\nEntropy is conserved for a reversible process. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process which happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible. In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost. More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process. For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the \"total\" entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible. An irreversible process increases entropy.", "The thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by Rudolf Clausius and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an isolated system in thermodynamic equilibrium with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the Carnot cycle. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its absolute temperature). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a function of state, specifically a thermodynamic state of the system. \n\nAccording to the Clausius equality, for a reversible cyclic process:\nformula_10\nThis means the line integral formula_11 is path-independent.\nSo we can define a state function called entropy, which satisfies\nformula_12\nClausius coined the name \"entropy\" () for in 1865. He gives \"transformational content\" () as a synonym, paralleling his \"thermal and ergonal content\" () as the name of , but preferring the term \"entropy\" as a close parallel of \"energy\", formed by replacing the root of \"work\" by that of \"transformation\". \n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states. Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states. However, the entropy change of the surroundings will be different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the third law of thermodynamics, which states that \"S\" = 0 at absolute zero for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in classical thermodynamics the entropy is interpreted as a state function of a thermodynamic system: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394\"E\", and its entropy falls by \u0394\"S\", a quantity at least \"T\" \u0394\"S\" of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (\"T\" is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nSection::::Definitions and descriptions.:Statistical mechanics.\nThe statistical definition was developed by Ludwig Boltzmann in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor which has since been known as Boltzmann's constant. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics is the measure of uncertainty, or \"mixedupness\" in the phrase of Gibbs, which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible microstates. In contrast to the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways in which a system may be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder). This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) which could give rise to the observed macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nSpecifically, entropy is a logarithmic measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied:\nor, equivalently, the expected value of the logarithm of the probability that a microstate will be occupied\nwhere \"k\" is the Boltzmann constant, equal to .\nThe summation is over all the possible microstates of the system, and \"p\" is the probability that the system is in the \"i\"-th microstate. This definition assumes that the basis set of states has been picked so that there is no information on their relative phases. In a different basis set, the more general expression is\nwhere formula_16 is the density matrix, formula_17 is trace and formula_18 is the matrix logarithm. This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for \"S\" can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called \"the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics\" or \"the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics\", the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. \"p\" = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium. Then the previous equation reduces to\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the microcanonical ensemble).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The equilibrium state of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system. This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\n\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables \"U\", \"V\" and \"W\", and observer B uses \"U\", \"V\", \"W\", \"X\", then, by changing \"X\", observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A. In other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may", "Section::::Definitions and descriptions.:Entropy of a system.\nEntropy arises directly from the Carnot cycle. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\nIn a thermodynamic system, pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the equilibrium state has higher probability (more possible combinations of microstates) than any other state.\nAs an example, for a glass of ice water in air at room temperature, the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the thermal energy from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an isolated system such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the thermodynamic system is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved state function that is of great importance in the sciences of physics and chemistry. Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their time reversals (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy. For isolated systems, entropy never decreases. This fact has several important consequences in science: first, it prohibits \"perpetual motion\" machines; and second, it implies the arrow of entropy has the same direction as the arrow of time. Increases in entropy correspond to irreversible changes in a system, because some energy is expended as waste heat, limiting the amount of work a system can do.\nUnlike many other functions of state, entropy cannot be directly observed but must be calculated. Entropy can be calculated for a substance as the standard molar entropy from absolute zero (also known as absolute entropy) or as a difference in entropy from some other reference state which is defined as zero entropy. Entropy has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of joules per kelvin (J/K) in the International System of Units. While these are the same units as heat capacity, the two concepts are distinct. Entropy is not a conserved quantity: for example, in an isolated system with non-uniform temperature, heat might irreversibly flow and the temperature become more uniform such that entropy increases. The second law of thermodynamics states that a closed system has entropy which may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine. A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\nA special case of entropy increase, the entropy of mixing, occurs when two or more different substances are mixed. If the substances are at the same temperature and pressure, there is no net exchange of heat or work \u2013 the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances. At a statistical mechanical level, this results due to the change in available volume per particle with mixing."], "wikipedia-7319263": ["In physics education, the concept of entropy is traditionally introduced as a quantitative measure of disorder. While acknowledging this approach is technically sound, some educators argue entropy and related thermodynamic concepts are easier to understand if entropy is described as a measure of energy dispersal instead. In this alternative approach, entropy is a measure of energy \"dispersal\" or \"distribution\" at a specific temperature. Changes in entropy can be quantitatively related to the distribution or the spreading out of the energy of a thermodynamic system, divided by its temperature.\nThe energy dispersal concept was advocated by Edward Armand Guggenheim in 1949, using the word 'spread'. As an approach to teaching entropy, it was developed to facilitate teaching entropy to students beginning university chemistry and biology. This approach avoids ambiguous terms such as disorder and chaos.\n\nEntropy can be described in terms of \"energy dispersal\" and the \"spreading of energy,\" while avoiding all mention of \"disorder\" and \"chaos\" except when explaining misconceptions. All explanations of where and how energy is dispersing or spreading have been recast in terms of energy dispersal, so as to emphasise the underlying qualitative meaning.\nIn this approach, the second law of thermodynamics is introduced as \"Energy spontaneously disperses from being localized to becoming spread out if it is not hindered from doing so,\" often in the context of common experiences such as a rock falling, a hot frying pan cooling down, iron rusting, air leaving a punctured tyre and ice melting in a warm room. Entropy is then depicted as a sophisticated kind of \"before and after\" yardstick \u2014 measuring how much energy is spread out over time as a result of a process such as heating a system, or how widely spread out the energy is after something happens in comparison with its previous state, in a process such as gas expansion or fluids mixing (at a constant temperature). The equations are explored with reference to the common experiences, with emphasis that in chemistry the energy that entropy measures as dispersing is the internal energy of molecules."], "wikipedia-20647050": ["One statement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics is that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.\nThis statement helps to define temperature but it does not, by itself, complete the definition. An empirical temperature is a numerical scale for the hotness of a thermodynamic system. Such hotness may be defined as existing on a one-dimensional manifold, stretching between hot and cold. Sometimes the zeroth law is stated to include the existence of a unique universal hotness manifold, and of numerical scales on it, so as to provide a complete definition of empirical temperature. To be suitable for empirical thermometry, a material must have a monotonic relation between hotness and some easily measured state variable, such as pressure or volume, when all other relevant coordinates are fixed. An exceptionally suitable system is the ideal gas, which can provide a temperature scale that matches the absolute Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale is defined on the basis of the second law of thermodynamics.\nSection::::Theoretical foundation.:Second law of thermodynamics.\nIn the previous section certain properties of temperature were expressed by the zeroth law of thermodynamics. It is also possible to define temperature in terms of the second law of thermodynamics which deals with entropy. The second law states that any process will result in either no change or a net increase in the entropy of the universe. This can be understood in terms of probability.\nFor example, in a series of coin tosses, a perfectly ordered system would be one in which either every toss comes up heads or every toss comes up tails. This means that for a perfectly ordered set of coin tosses, there is only one set of toss outcomes possible: the set in which 100% of tosses come up the same. On the other hand, there are multiple combinations that can result in disordered or mixed systems, where some fraction are heads and the rest tails. A disordered system can be 90% heads and 10% tails, or it could be 98% heads and 2% tails, etcetera. As the number of coin tosses increases, the number of possible combinations corresponding to imperfectly ordered systems increases. For a very large number of coin tosses, the combinations to ~50% heads and ~50% tails dominate and obtaining an outcome significantly different from 50/50 becomes extremely unlikely. Thus the system naturally progresses to a state of maximum disorder or entropy.\nIt has been previously stated that temperature governs the transfer of heat between two systems and it was just shown that the universe tends to progress so as to maximize entropy, which is expected of any natural system. Thus, it is expected that there is some relationship between temperature and entropy. To find this relationship, the relationship between heat, work and temperature is first considered. A heat engine is a device for converting thermal energy into mechanical energy, resulting in the performance of work, and analysis of the Carnot heat engine provides the necessary relationships. The work from a heat engine corresponds to the difference between the heat put into the system at the high temperature, \"q\" and the heat ejected at the low temperature, \"q\". The efficiency is the work divided by the heat put into the system:\nwhere \"w\" is the work done per cycle. The efficiency depends only on \"q\"/\"q\". Because \"q\" and \"q\" correspond to heat transfer at the temperatures \"T\" and \"T\" respectively, \"q\"/\"q\" should be some function of these temperatures:\nCarnot's theorem states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Thus, a heat engine operating between \"T\" and \"T\" must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between \"T\" and \"T\", and the second between \"T\" and \"T\". This can only be the case if\nwhich implies\nSince the first function is independent of \"T\", this temperature must cancel on the right side, meaning \"f\"(\"T\",\"T\") is of the form \"g\"(\"T\")/\"g\"(\"T\") (i.e. \"f\"(\"T\",\"T\") = \"f\"(\"T\",\"T\")\"f\"(\"T\",\"T\") = \"g\"(\"T\")/\"g\"(\"T\")\u00b7 \"g\"(\"T\")/\"g\"(\"T\") = \"g\"(\"T\")/\"g\"(\"T\")), where \"g\" is a function of a single temperature. A temperature scale can now be chosen with the property that\nSubstituting (6) back into (4) gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of temperature:\nFor \"T\" = 0 K the efficiency is 100% and that efficiency becomes greater than 100% below 0 K. Since an efficiency greater than 100% violates the first law of thermodynamics, this implies that 0 K is the minimum possible temperature. In fact the lowest temperature ever obtained in a macroscopic system was 20 nK, which was achieved in 1995 at NIST. Subtracting the right hand side of (5) from the middle portion and rearranging gives\nwhere the negative sign indicates heat ejected from the system. This relationship suggests the existence of a state function, \"S\", defined by\nwhere the subscript indicates a reversible process. The change of this state function around any cycle is zero, as is necessary for any state function. This function corresponds to the entropy of the system, which was described previously. Rearranging (8) gives a formula for temperature in terms of fictive infinitesimal quasi-reversible elements of entropy and heat:\nFor a system, where entropy \"S\"(\"E\") is a function of its energy \"E\", the temperature \"T\" is given by\ni.e. the reciprocal of the temperature is the rate of increase of entropy with respect to energy."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-7592567": 3, "wikipedia-133017": 1, "wikipedia-4700845": 3, "wikipedia-302133": 1, "wikipedia-1216879": 1, "wikipedia-9891": 3, "wikipedia-4701197": 1, "wikipedia-7319263": 3, "wikipedia-20647050": 2, "wikipedia-3015758": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-7592567": 3, "wikipedia-133017": 2, "wikipedia-4700845": 3, "wikipedia-302133": 2, "wikipedia-1216879": 1, "wikipedia-9891": 3, "wikipedia-4701197": 1, "wikipedia-7319263": 3, "wikipedia-20647050": 3, "wikipedia-3015758": 1}}}

Entropy is then depicted as a sophisticated kind of \"before and after\" yardstick \u2014 measuring how much energy is spread out over time as a result of a process such as heating a system, or how widely spread out the energy is after something happens in comparison with its previous state, in a process such as gas expansion or fluids mixing (at a constant temperature). The equations are explored with reference to the common experiences, with emphasis that in chemistry the energy that entropy measures as dispersing is the internal energy of molecules.\nThe statistical interpretation is related to quantum mechanics in describing the way that energy is distributed (quantized) amongst molecules on specific energy levels, with all the energy of the macrostate always in only one microstate at one instant. Entropy is described as measuring the energy dispersal for a system by the number of accessible microstates, the number of different arrangements of all its energy at the next instant. Thus, an increase in entropy means a greater number of microstates for the final state than for the initial state, and hence more possible arrangements of a system's total energy at any one instant. Here, the greater 'dispersal of the total energy of a system' means the existence of many possibilities.\nContinuous movement and molecular collisions visualised as being like bouncing balls blown by air as used in a lottery can then lead on to showing the possibilities of many Boltzmann distributions and continually changing \"distribution of the instant\", and on to the idea that when the system changes, dynamic molecules will have a greater number of accessible microstates.

The amount of information conveyed by each event defined in this way becomes a random variable whose expected value is the information entropy. Generally, \"entropy\" refers to disorder or uncertainty, and the definition of entropy used in information theory is directly analogous to the definition used in statistical thermodynamics. The concept of information entropy was introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\".\nThe logarithm of the probability distribution is useful as a measure of entropy because it is additive for independent sources. For instance, the entropy of a fair coin toss is 1 bit, and the entropy of tosses is bits. In a straightforward representation, bits are needed to represent a variable that can take one of values if is a power of 2. If these values are equally probable, the entropy (in bits) is equal to . If one of the values is more probable to occur than the others, an observation that this value occurs is less informative than if some less common outcome had occurred. Conversely, rarer events provide more information when observed. Since observation of less probable events occurs more rarely, the net effect is that the entropy (thought of as average information) received from non-uniformly distributed data is always less than or equal to . Entropy is zero when one outcome is certain to occur. The entropy quantifies these considerations when a probability distribution of the source data is known. The \"meaning\" of the events observed (the meaning of \"messages\") does not matter in the definition of entropy. Entropy only takes into account the probability of observing a specific event, so the information it encapsulates is information about the underlying probability distribution, not the meaning of the events themselves.", "Uniform probability yields maximum uncertainty and therefore maximum entropy.

Yes  \n2. The concept of entropy in information theory, as covered on Wikipedia, measures uncertainty or unpredictability in a system. In the context of a grid (e.g., a word puzzle or language model), word probabilities represent the likelihood of certain words appearing. Entropy quantifies how \"surprising\" or dispersed these probabilities are\u2014higher entropy means more uncertainty (e.g., evenly distributed word choices), while lower entropy implies predictability (e.g., a few high-probability words dominate). Wikipedia's pages on [Entropy (Information Theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) and related topics can clarify this connection.", "wikipedia-15445": ["The measure of information entropy associated with each possible data value is the negative logarithm of the probability mass function for the value: \nWhen the data source produces a low-probability value (i.e., when a low-probability event occurs), the event carries more \"information\" (\"surprisal\") than when the source data produces a high-probability value. The amount of information conveyed by each event defined in this way becomes a random variable whose expected value is the information entropy. Generally, \"entropy\" refers to disorder or uncertainty, and the definition of entropy used in information theory is directly analogous to the definition used in statistical thermodynamics. The concept of information entropy was introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\".\nThe basic idea of information theory is that the \"news value\" of a communicated message depends on the degree to which the content of the message is surprising. If an event is very probable, it is no surprise (and generally uninteresting) when that event happens as expected. However, if an event is unlikely to occur, it is much more informative to learn that the event happened or will happen. For instance, the knowledge that some particular number \"will not\" be the winning number of a lottery provides very little information, because any particular chosen number will almost certainly not win. However, knowledge that a particular number \"will\" win a lottery has high value because it communicates the outcome of a very low probability event. The information content (also called the \"surprisal\") of an event formula_2 is an increasing function of the reciprocal of the probability formula_3 of the event, precisely formula_4. Entropy measures the expected (i.e., average) amount of information conveyed by identifying the outcome of a random trial. This implies that casting a die has higher entropy than tossing a coin because each outcome of a die toss has smaller probability (about formula_5) than each outcome of a coin toss (formula_6).\nEntropy is a measure of the \"unpredictability\" of the state, or equivalently, of its \"average information content\". To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the poll is not already known. In other words, the outcome of the poll is relatively \"unpredictable\", and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new \"information\"; these are just different ways of saying that the \"a priori\" entropy of the poll results is large. Now, consider the case that the same poll is performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first poll is already known, the outcome of the second poll can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the \"a priori\" entropy of the second poll result is small relative to that of the first.", "Examples of the latter include redundancy in language structure or statistical properties relating to the occurrence frequencies of letter or word pairs, triplets etc."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-15445": 1, "wikipedia-9891": 1, "wikipedia-4700845": 1, "wikipedia-3325140": 1, "wikipedia-56654711": 1, "wikipedia-812296": 1, "wikipedia-7728392": 1, "wikipedia-30303286": 1, "wikipedia-7319263": 1, "wikipedia-35482259": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-15445": 2, "wikipedia-9891": 1, "wikipedia-4700845": 1, "wikipedia-3325140": 1, "wikipedia-56654711": 1, "wikipedia-812296": 1, "wikipedia-7728392": 1, "wikipedia-30303286": 1, "wikipedia-7319263": 1, "wikipedia-35482259": 1}}}

Higher entropy means more uncertainty or possibilities, which aligns with how word selection involves narrowing down options based on constraints. Wikipedia's articles on entropy, information theory, and decision-making provide conceptual foundations for this connection.", "wikipedia-15445": ["Entropy measures the expected (i.e., average) amount of information conveyed by identifying the outcome of a random trial. This implies that casting a die has higher entropy than tossing a coin because each outcome of a die toss has smaller probability (about formula_5) than each outcome of a coin toss (formula_6).\n\nEntropy is a measure of the \"unpredictability\" of the state, or equivalently, of its \"average information content\". To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the poll is not already known. In other words, the outcome of the poll is relatively \"unpredictable\", and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new \"information\"; these are just different ways of saying that the \"a priori\" entropy of the poll results is large. Now, consider the case that the same poll is performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first poll is already known, the outcome of the second poll can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the \"a priori\" entropy of the second poll result is small relative to that of the first.\n\nConsider the example of a coin toss. If the probability of heads is the same as the probability of tails, then the entropy of the coin toss is as high as it could be for a two-outcome trial. There is no way to predict the outcome of the coin toss ahead of time: if one has to choose, there is no average advantage to be gained by predicting that the toss will come up heads or tails, as either prediction will be correct with probability formula_7. Such a coin toss has one bit of entropy since there are two possible outcomes that occur with equal probability, and learning the actual outcome contains one bit of information. In contrast, a coin toss using a coin that has two heads and no tails has zero entropy since the coin will always come up heads, and the outcome can be predicted perfectly. Analogously, a binary event with equiprobable outcomes has a Shannon entropy of formula_8 bit. Similarly, one trit with equiprobable values contains formula_9 (about 1.58496) bits of information because it can have one of three values."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-29675785": 1, "wikipedia-427282": 1, "wikipedia-4740896": 1, "wikipedia-63778": 1, "wikipedia-15445": 1, "wikipedia-3015758": 1, "wikipedia-13954448": 1, "wikipedia-9891": 1, "wikipedia-5987648": 1, "wikipedia-7815174": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-29675785": 1, "wikipedia-427282": 1, "wikipedia-4740896": 1, "wikipedia-63778": 1, "wikipedia-15445": 2, "wikipedia-3015758": 1, "wikipedia-13954448": 1, "wikipedia-9891": 1, "wikipedia-5987648": 1, "wikipedia-7815174": 1}}}

Short segments using finished game engines may be presented as game demos.\nBULLET::::- Graphics cards manufacturers use tech demos to showcase the performance of their cards even before there are any games that can deliver that performance or before the product is ready to be used outside of the development labs. In November 2002, Nvidia started the practice of featuring realistic female characters in graphics card technology demos, by releasing Dawn for its GeForce FX card.

This property can be used to perform binary addition using just a single row of the grid. First, lay out a binary number on a row using counters to represent the 1s in the number.

Now overlay the second number on this row. Say we place 9 (= 1001 in binary) on it like this. Unlike addition and subtraction, the entire grid is used to multiply, divide, and extract square roots. The grid has some useful properties utilized in these operations. First, all the squares on any diagonal going from the bottom left to the top right have the same value. Since a diagonal move can be broken down into a move to the right (which halves the value) followed by a move up (which doubles the value), the value of the square stays the same. Recall that moving counters diagonally doesn't change the value, so move all the counters on inner squares diagonally until they hit either the bottom row or the left column. Finally, replace the two counters on the corner with one above it and \"read off\" the binary number in an L-shaped fashion, starting from the top left down to the bottom left corner, and then over to the bottom right. The bottom row is of course just the first six powers of two, but notice that the leftmost column has the next five powers of two.

Histograms can be quick to calculate, and simple, so this approach has some attractions. However, the estimate produced is biased, and although corrections can be made to the estimate, they may not always be satisfactory.\nA method better suited for multidimensional probability density functions (pdf) is to first make a pdf estimate with some method, and then, from the pdf estimate, compute the entropy. A useful pdf estimate method is e.g. Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM), where the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to find an ML estimate of a weighted sum of Gaussian pdf's approximating the data pdf.\nIf the data is one-dimensional, we can imagine taking all the observations and putting them in order of their value. The spacing between one value and the next then gives us a rough idea of (the reciprocal of) the probability density in that region: the closer together the values are, the higher the probability density. This is a very rough estimate with high variance, but can be improved, for example by thinking about the space between a given value and the one \"m\" away from it, where \"m\" is some fixed number.\nThe probability density estimated in this way can then be used to calculate the entropy estimate, in a similar way to that given above for the histogram, but with some slight tweaks.\nFor each point in our dataset, we can find the distance to its nearest neighbour. We can in fact estimate the entropy from the distribution of the nearest-neighbour-distance of our datapoints. (In a uniform distribution these distances all tend to be fairly similar, whereas in a strongly nonuniform distribution they may vary a lot more.)\nWhen in under-sampled regime, having a prior on the distribution can help the estimation. One such Bayesian estimator was proposed in the neuroscience context known as the NSB (Nemenman\u2013Shafee\u2013Bialek) estimator. The NSB estimator uses a mixture of Dirichlet prior, chosen such that the induced prior over the entropy is approximately uniform.\nA new approach to the problem of entropy evaluation is to compare the expected entropy of a sample of random sequence with the calculated entropy of the sample. The method gives very accurate results, but it is limited to calculations of random sequences modeled as Markov chains of the first order with small values of bias and correlations.

A volcano plot combines a measure of statistical significance from a statistical test (e.g., a p value from an ANOVA model) with the magnitude of the change, enabling quick visual identification of those data-points (genes, etc.) that display large magnitude changes that are also statistically significant. A volcano plot is constructed by plotting the negative log of the p value on the y axis (usually base 10).

Meanwhile, we can also see the average fold-change for each gene or compound. The dual-flashlight plot is similar to the volcano plot. In a volcano plot, the p-value (or q-value), instead of SMCV or SSMD, is plotted against average fold-change. The advantage of using SMCV over p-value (or q-value) is that, if there exist any non-zero true effects for a gene or compound, the estimated SMCV goes to its population value whereas the p-value (or q-value) for testing no mean difference (or zero contrast mean) goes to zero when the sample size increases. Hence, the value of SMCV is comparable whereas the value of p-value or q-value is not comparable in experiments with different sample size, especially when many investigated genes or compounds do not have exactly zero effects.

Likewise, for a function of several real variables, a critical point is a value in its domain where the gradient is undefined or is equal to zero.\nThe value of the function at a critical point is a critical value.\nThis sort of definition extends to differentiable maps between R and R, a critical point being, in this case, a point where the rank of the Jacobian matrix is not maximal. It extends further to differentiable maps between differentiable manifolds, as the points where the rank of the Jacobian matrix decreases. In this case, critical points are also called 'bifurcation points'.\nIn particular, if 'C' is a plane curve, defined by an implicit equation 'f'('x','y') = 0, the critical points of the projection onto the 'x'-axis, parallel to the 'y'-axis are the points where the tangent to 'C' are parallel to the 'y'-axis, that is the points where formula_1.

For instance, liquid water under normal conditions is nearly incompressible, has a low thermal expansion coefficient, has a high dielectric constant, and is an excellent solvent for electrolytes. Near the critical point, all these properties change into the exact opposite: water becomes compressible, expandable, a poor dielectric, a bad solvent for electrolytes, and prefers to mix with nonpolar gases and organic molecules.\n\n\"At\" the critical point, only one phase exists.

Multiple guesses were allowed, with no penalties for incorrect guesses.\nSection::::Gameplay.:Power Surges.\nAt various points in the game, the teams would uncover Power Surges randomly hidden on the board. In round one, a square that hid one allowed the team to play a bonus game for a chance at $20 and see an actual piece of the puzzle instead of the connected dots.

The amount of information conveyed by each event defined in this way becomes a random variable whose expected value is the information entropy. Generally, \"entropy\" refers to disorder or uncertainty, and the definition of entropy used in information theory is directly analogous to the definition used in statistical thermodynamics. The concept of information entropy was introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\".\nThe basic idea of a lottery provides very little information, because any particular chosen number will almost certainly not win. However, knowledge that a particular number \"will\" win a lottery has high value because it communicates the outcome of a very low probability event. The information content (also called the \"surprisal\") of an event formula_2 is an increasing function of the reciprocal of the probability formula_3 of the event, precisely formula_4. Entropy measures the expected (i.e., average) amount of information conveyed by identifying the outcome of a random trial. This implies that casting a die has higher entropy than tossing a coin because each outcome of a die toss has smaller probability (about formula_5) than each outcome of a coin toss (formula_6).\nEntropy is a measure of the \"unpredictability\" of the state, or equivalently, of its \"average information content\". To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the poll is not already known. In other words, the outcome of the poll is relatively \"unpredictable\", and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new \"information\"; these are just different ways of saying that the \"a priori\" entropy of the poll results is large. Now, consider the case that the same poll is performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first poll is already known, the outcome of the second poll can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the \"a priori\" entropy of the second poll result is small relative to that of the first.\nConsider the example of a coin toss. If the probability of heads is the same as the probability of tails, then the entropy of the coin toss is as high as it could be for a two-outcome trial. There is no way to predict the outcome of the coin toss ahead of time: if one has to choose, there is no average advantage to be gained by predicting that the toss will come up heads or tails, as either prediction will be correct with probability formula_7. Such a coin toss has one bit of entropy since there are two possible outcomes that occur with equal probability, and learning the actual outcome contains one bit of information. In contrast, a coin toss using a coin that has two heads and no tails has zero entropy since the coin will always come up heads, and the outcome can be predicted perfectly. Analogously, a binary event with equiprobable outcomes has a Shannon entropy of formula_8 bit. Similarly, one trit with equiprobable values contains formula_9 (about 1.58496) bits of information because it can have one of three values.", "The entropy of the unknown result of the next toss of the coin is maximized if the coin is fair (that is, if heads and tails both have equal probability 1/2). This is the situation of maximum uncertainty as it is most difficult to predict the outcome of the next toss; the result of each toss of the coin delivers one full bit of information. This is because\n\nHowever, if we know the coin is not fair, but comes up heads or tails with probabilities and , where , then there is less uncertainty. Every time it is tossed, one side is more likely to come up than the other. The reduced uncertainty is quantified in a lower entropy: on average each toss of the coin delivers less than one full bit of information.

The amount of information conveyed by each event defined in this way becomes a random variable whose expected value is the information entropy. Generally, \"entropy\" refers to disorder or uncertainty, and the definition of entropy used in information theory is directly analogous to the definition used in statistical thermodynamics. The concept of information entropy was introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\".\nInformation entropy is typically measured in bits (alternatively called \"shannons\") or sometimes in \"natural units\" (nats) or decimal digits (called \"dits\", \"bans\", or \"hartleys\"). The unit of the measurement depends on the base of the logarithm that is used to define the entropy.\nThe logarithm of the probability distribution is useful as a measure of entropy because it is additive for independent sources. For instance, the entropy of a fair coin toss is 1 bit, and the entropy of tosses is bits. In a straightforward representation, bits are needed to represent a variable that can take one of values if is a power of 2. If these values are equally probable, the entropy (in bits) is equal to . If one of the values is more probable to occur than the others, an observation that this value occurs is less informative than if some less common outcome had occurred. Conversely, rarer events provide more information when observed. Since observation of less probable events occurs more rarely, the net effect is that the entropy (thought of as average information) received from non-uniformly distributed data is always less than or equal to . Entropy is zero when one outcome is certain to occur. The entropy quantifies these considerations when a probability distribution of the source data is known. The \"meaning\" of the events observed (the meaning of \"messages\") does not matter in the definition of entropy. Entropy only takes into account the probability of observing a specific event, so the information it encapsulates is information about the underlying probability distribution, not the meaning of the events themselves.", "Common values of are 2, Euler's number, and 10, and the corresponding units of entropy are the bits for , nats for , and bans for .\n\nThis is the situation of maximum uncertainty as it is most difficult to predict the outcome of the next toss; the result of each toss of the coin delivers one full bit of information. This is because\n\nHowever, if we know the coin is not fair, but comes up heads or tails with probabilities and , where , then there is less uncertainty. Every time it is tossed, one side is more likely to come up than the other. The reduced uncertainty is quantified in a lower entropy: on average each toss of the coin delivers less than one full bit of information. For example, if =0.7, then\n\nUniform probability yields maximum uncertainty and therefore maximum entropy. Entropy, then, can only decrease from the value associated with uniform probability. The extreme case is that of a double-headed coin that never comes up tails, or a double-tailed coin that never results in a head. Then there is no uncertainty. The entropy is zero: each toss of the coin delivers no new information as the outcome of each coin toss is always certain.\n\nEntropy can be normalized by dividing it by information length. This ratio is called metric entropy and is a measure of the randomness of the information.\n\nShannon discovered that the proper choice of function to quantify information, preserving this additivity, is logarithmic, i.e.,\n\nlet formula_30 be the information function which one assumes to be twice continuously differentiable, one has:\n\nThis differential equation leads to the solution formula_32 for any formula_33. Condition 2. leads to formula_34 and especially, formula_35 can be chosen on the form formula_36 with formula_37, which is equivalent to choosing a specific base for the logarithm. The different units of information (bits for the binary logarithm , nats for the natural logarithm , bans for the decimal logarithm and so on) are constant multiples of each other. For instance, in case of a fair coin toss, heads provides bit of information, which is approximately 0.693 nats or 0.301 decimal digits. Because of additivity, tosses provide bits of information, which is approximately nats or decimal digits.\n\nIf there is a distribution where event can happen with probability , and it is sampled times with an outcome occurring times, the total amount of information we have received is \n\nThe \"average\" amount of information that we receive per event is therefore"], "wikipedia-427282": ["If the log base 2 is used, the units of mutual information are bits.\n\nMutual information measures the information that formula_2 and formula_3 share: It measures how much knowing one of these variables reduces uncertainty about the other. For example, if formula_2 and formula_3 are independent, then knowing formula_2 does not give any information about formula_3 and vice versa, so their mutual information is zero. At the other extreme, if formula_2 is a deterministic function of formula_3 and formula_3 is a deterministic function of formula_2 then all information conveyed by formula_2 is shared with formula_3: knowing formula_2 determines the value of formula_3 and vice versa. As a result, in this case the mutual information is the same as the uncertainty contained in formula_3 (or formula_2) alone, namely the entropy of formula_3 (or formula_2). Moreover, this mutual information is the same as the entropy of formula_2 and as the entropy of formula_3. (A very special case of this is when formula_2 and formula_3 are the same random variable.)\n\nMutual information is a measure of the inherent dependence expressed in the joint distribution of formula_2 and formula_3 relative to the joint distribution of formula_2 and formula_3 under the assumption of independence. Mutual information therefore measures dependence in the following sense: formula_56 if and only if formula_2 and formula_3 are independent random variables. This is easy to see in one direction: if formula_2 and formula_3 are independent, then formula_61, and therefore:\n\nMoreover, mutual information is nonnegative (i.e. formula_63 see below) and symmetric (i.e. formula_64 see below).\n\nMutual Information is also known as information gain."], "wikipedia-2507412": ["In information theory and machine learning, information gain is a synonym for \"Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence\"; the amount of information gained about a random variable or signal from observing another random variable.

The game is designed to have the player experience the low and high moments of this period in the style of a point-and-click adventure game, using the medium's interactivity and immersion to relate the tale in ways that a film cannot. It was initially developed to relate Ryan and Amy's personal experience with Joel when they were uncertain of his health, but following his death, they reworked much of the game to memorialize and personalize their time and interactions with Joel for the player. Alongside the game, a documentary, \"Thank You for Playing\", documenting both the last few years of Joel's life and the development of the game, was aired in 2016.\n\n\"That Dragon, Cancer\" was initially aimed for release as a time-limited exclusive for the Ouya, whose makers helped to fund the game's development. With expanded funding and a larger scope to the game, the developers engaged in a crowdfunding on Kickstarter, in association with Ouya, to secure additional funds to complete the game and assuring simultaneous release on other platforms including Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. The game was released on January 12, 2016 for these systems, on what would have been Joel's seventh birthday. An iOS version was released in October 2016.

He died in 2001. He was survived by his wife, Mary Elizabeth Moore Shannon, his son, Andrew Moore Shannon, his daughter, Margarita Shannon, his sister, Catherine Shannon Kay, and his two granddaughters. His wife stated in his obituary that, had it not been for Alzheimer's disease, \"He would have been bemused\" by it all.\nOutside of Shannon's academic pursuits, he was interested in juggling, unicycling, and chess. He also invented many devices, including a Roman numeral computer called THROBAC, juggling machines, and a flame-throwing trumpet. One of his more humorous devices was a box kept on his desk called the \"Ultimate Machine\", based on an idea by Marvin Minsky. Otherwise featureless, the box possessed a single switch on its side. When the switch was flipped, the lid of the box opened and a mechanical hand reached out, flipped off the switch, then retracted back inside the box. In addition, he built a device that could solve the Rubik's Cube puzzle.\nShannon designed the Minivac 601, a digital computer trainer to teach business people about how computers functioned. It was sold by the Scientific Development Corp starting in 1961.\nHe is also considered the co-inventor of the first wearable computer along with Edward O. Thorp. The device was used to improve the odds when playing roulette.\nShannon married Norma Levor, a wealthy, Jewish, left-wing intellectual in January 1940. The marriage ended in divorce after about a year. Levor later married Ben Barzman.\nShannon met his second wife Betty Shannon (n\u00e9e Mary Elizabeth Moore) when she was a numerical analyst at Bell Labs. They were married in 1949. Betty assisted Claude in building some of his most famous inventions.\nClaude and Betty Shannon had three children, Robert James Shannon, Andrew Moore Shannon, and Margarita Shannon, and raised their family in Winchester, Massachusetts. Their oldest son, Robert Shannon, died in 1998 at the age of 45.\nAfter suffering the progressive declines of Alzheimer's disease over some years, Shannon died at the age of 84, on February 24, 2001.\nTo commemorate Shannon's achievements, there were celebrations of his work in 2001.\nThere are currently six statues of Shannon sculpted by Eugene Daub: one at the University of Michigan; one at MIT in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems; one in Gaylord, Michigan; one at the University of California, San Diego; one at Bell Labs; and another at AT&T Shannon Labs.

To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration, called the \"method of inner models\", which later became an essential instrument in set theory.\n\nIn a series of famous papers that were published in 1932, von Neumann made foundational contributions to ergodic theory, a branch of mathematics that involves the states of dynamical systems with an invariant measure. Of the 1932 papers on ergodic theory, Paul Halmos writes that even \"if von Neumann had never done anything else, they would have been sufficient to guarantee him mathematical immortality\".", "Von Neumann introduced the study of rings of operators, through the von Neumann algebras. A von Neumann algebra is a *-algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that is closed in the weak operator topology and contains the identity operator. The von Neumann bicommutant theorem shows that the analytic definition is equivalent to a purely algebraic definition as being equal to the bicommutant. Von Neumann embarked in 1936, with the partial collaboration of F.J. Murray, on the general study of factors classification of von Neumann algebras. The six major papers in which he developed that theory between 1936 and 1940 \"rank among the masterpieces of analysis in the twentieth century\".\nVon Neumann was the first to establish a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics, known as the Dirac\u2013von Neumann axioms, with his 1932 work \"Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\". After having completed the axiomatization of set theory, he began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics. He realized, in 1926, that a state of a quantum system could be represented by a point in a (complex) Hilbert space that, in general, could be infinite-dimensional even for a single particle. In this formalism of quantum mechanics, observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as linear operators acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system.", "The formalism of density operators and matrices was introduced by von Neumann in 1927 and independently, but less systematically by Lev Landau and Felix Bloch in 1927 and 1946 respectively. The density matrix is an alternative way in which to represent the state of a quantum system, which could otherwise be represented using the wavefunction. The density matrix allows the solution of certain time-dependent problems in quantum mechanics.\n\nThe von Neumann measurement scheme, the ancestor of quantum decoherence theory, represents measurements projectively by taking into account the measuring apparatus which is also treated as a quantum object. The 'projective measurement' scheme introduced by von Neumann, led to the development of quantum decoherence theories.\n\nVon Neumann first proposed a quantum logic in his 1932 treatise \"Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\", where he noted that projections on a Hilbert space can be viewed as propositions about physical observables. The field of quantum logic was subsequently inaugurated, in a famous paper of 1936 by von Neumann and Garrett Birkhoff, the first work ever to introduce quantum logics, wherein von Neumann and Birkhoff first proved that quantum mechanics requires a propositional calculus substantially different from all classical logics and rigorously isolated a new algebraic structure for quantum logics.\n\nVon Neumann founded the field of game theory as a mathematical discipline. Von Neumann proved his minimax theorem in 1928. This theorem establishes that in zero-sum games with perfect information (i.e. in which players know at each time all moves that have taken place so far), there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses, hence the name minimax. When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider all the possible responses of his adversary. The player then plays out the strategy that will result in the minimization of his maximum loss. Such strategies, which minimize the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players, publishing this result in his 1944 \"Theory of Games and Economic Behavior\" (written with Oskar Morgenstern).\n\nVon Neumann raised the intellectual and mathematical level of economics in several influential publications. For his model of an expanding economy, von Neumann proved the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium using his generalization of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. Von Neumann's model of an expanding economy considered the matrix pencil \"A \u2212 \u03bbB\" with nonnegative matrices A and B; von Neumann sought probability vectors \"p\" and \"q\" and a positive number \"\u03bb\" that would solve the complementarity equation along with two inequality systems expressing economic efficiency. In this model, the (transposed) probability vector \"p\" represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the \"intensity\" at which the production process would run. The unique solution \"\u03bb\" represents the growth factor which is 1 plus the rate of growth of the economy; the rate of growth equals the interest rate.", "Von Neumann made fundamental contributions to mathematical statistics. In 1941, he derived the exact distribution of the ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables. This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the Durbin\u2013Watson statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the errors are serially independent against the alternative that they follow a stationary first order autoregression.\n\nVon Neumann made fundamental contributions in the field of fluid dynamics.\nVon Neumann's contributions to fluid dynamics included his discovery of the classic flow solution to blast waves, and the co-discovery (independently of Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Werner D\u00f6ring) of the ZND detonation model of explosives. During the 1930s, von Neumann became an authority on the mathematics of shaped charges.\n\nStan Ulam, who knew von Neumann well, described his mastery of mathematics this way: \"Most mathematicians know one method. For example, Norbert Wiener had mastered Fourier transforms. Some mathematicians have mastered two methods and might really impress someone who knows only one of them. John von Neumann had mastered three methods.\" He went on to explain that the three methods were:\n- A facility with the symbolic manipulation of linear operators;\n- An intuitive feeling for the logical structure of any new mathematical theory;\n- An intuitive feeling for the combinatorial superstructure of new theories.\nEdward Teller wrote that \"Nobody knows all science, not even von Neumann did. But as for mathematics, he contributed to every part of it except number theory and topology. That is, I think, something unique.\"\n\nBeginning in the late 1930s, von Neumann developed an expertise in explosions\u2014phenomena that are difficult to model mathematically. During this period, von Neumann was the leading authority of the mathematics of shaped charges. This led him to a large number of military consultancies, primarily for the Navy, which in turn led to his involvement in the Manhattan Project. The involvement included frequent trips by train to the project's secret research facilities at the Los Alamos Laboratory in a remote part of New Mexico.\n\nVon Neumann made his principal contribution to the atomic bomb in the concept and design of the explosive lenses that were needed to compress the plutonium core of the Fat Man weapon that was later dropped on Nagasaki.", "For his wartime services, von Neumann was awarded the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award in July 1946, and the Medal for Merit in October 1946.\nVon Neumann is credited with developing the equilibrium strategy of mutual assured destruction (MAD). He also \"moved heaven and earth\" to bring MAD about.\nVon Neumann was a founding figure in computing. Von Neumann was the inventor, in 1945, of the merge sort algorithm, in which the first and second halves of an array are each sorted recursively and then merged.\nWhile consulting for the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania on the EDVAC project, von Neumann wrote an incomplete \"First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC\". The paper, whose premature distribution nullified the patent claims of EDVAC designers J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, described a computer architecture in which the data and the program are both stored in the computer's memory in the same address space. This architecture is the basis of most modern computer designs, unlike the earliest computers that were \"programmed\" using a separate memory device such as a paper tape or plugboard. Although the single-memory, stored program architecture is commonly called von Neumann architecture as a result of von Neumann's paper, the architecture was based on the work of Eckert and Mauchly, inventors of the ENIAC computer at the University of Pennsylvania.", "The cybernetics movement highlighted the question of what it takes for self-reproduction to occur autonomously, and in 1952, John von Neumann designed an elaborate 2D cellular automaton that would automatically make a copy of its initial configuration of cells. The von Neumann neighborhood, in which each cell in a two-dimensional grid has the four orthogonally adjacent grid cells as neighbors, continues to be used for other cellular automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth.\n\nBeginning in 1949, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology.\n\nAs part of his research into weather forecasting, von Neumann founded the \"Meteorological Program\" in Princeton in 1946, securing funding for his project from the US Navy. Von Neumann and his appointed assistant on this project, Jule Gregory Charney, wrote the world's first climate modelling software, and used it to perform the world's first numerical weather forecasts on the ENIAC computer; von Neumann and his team published the results as \"Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation\" in 1950. Together they played a leading role in efforts to integrate sea-air exchanges of energy and moisture into the study of climate.\n\nOther mathematicians were stunned by von Neumann's ability to instantaneously perform complex operations in his head. As a six-year-old, he could divide two eight-digit numbers in his head and converse in Ancient Greek. When he was sent at the age of 15 to study advanced calculus under analyst G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151, Szeg\u0151 was so astounded with the boy's talent in mathematics that he was brought to tears on their first meeting.\n\nVon Neumann was also noted for his eidetic memory (sometimes called photographic memory). Herman Goldstine wrote:\nVon Neumann was reportedly able to memorize the pages of telephone directories. He entertained friends by asking them to randomly call out page numbers; he then recited the names, addresses and numbers therein.", "\"the influence of a scientist is interpreted broadly enough to include impact on fields beyond science proper, then John von Neumann was probably the most influential mathematician who ever lived,\" wrote Mikl\u00f3s R\u00e9dei in \"John von Neumann: Selected Letters\". James Glimm wrote: \"he is regarded as one of the giants of modern mathematics\". The mathematician Jean Dieudonn\u00e9 said that von Neumann \"may have been the last representative of a once-flourishing and numerous group, the great mathematicians who were equally at home in pure and applied mathematics and who throughout their careers maintained a steady production in both directions\", while Peter Lax described him as possessing the \"most scintillating intellect of this century\". In the foreword of Mikl\u00f3s R\u00e9dei's \"Selected Letters\", Peter Lax wrote, \"To gain a measure of von Neumann's achievements, consider that had he lived a normal span of years, he would certainly have been a recipient of a Nobel Prize in economics. And if there were Nobel Prizes in computer science and mathematics, he would have been honored by these, too. So the writer of these letters should be thought of as a triple Nobel laureate or, possibly, a -fold winner, for his work in physics, in particular, quantum mechanics\"."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Von Neumann was generally regarded as the foremost mathematician of his time and said to be \"the last representative of the great mathematicians\"; a genius who was comfortable integrating both pure and applied sciences.\nHe made major contributions to a number of fields, including mathematics (foundations of mathematics, functional analysis, ergodic theory, representation theory, operator algebras, geometry, topology, and numerical analysis), physics (quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, and quantum statistical mechanics), economics (game theory), computing (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics.\nHe was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics in the development of functional analysis, and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer.\nHe published over 150 papers in his life: about 60 in pure mathematics, 60 in applied mathematics, 20 in physics, and the remainder on special mathematical subjects or non-mathematical ones. His last work, an unfinished manuscript written while he was in hospital, was later published in book form as \"The Computer and the Brain\".\nHis analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. In a short list of facts about his life he submitted to the National Academy of Sciences, he stated, \"The part of my work I consider most essential is that on quantum mechanics, which developed in G\u00f6ttingen in 1926, and subsequently in Berlin in 1927\u20131929. Also, my work on various forms of operator theory, Berlin 1930 and Princeton 1935\u20131939; on the ergodic theorem, Princeton, 1931\u20131932.\"", "Von Neumann's closest friend in the United States was mathematician Stanis\u0142aw Ulam. A later friend of Ulam's, Gian-Carlo Rota, wrote, \"They would spend hours on end gossiping and giggling, swapping Jewish jokes, and drifting in and out of mathematical talk.\" When von Neumann was dying in the hospital, every time Ulam visited, he came prepared with a new collection of jokes to cheer him up. He believed that much of his mathematical thought occurred intuitively, and he would often go to sleep with a problem unsolved and know the answer immediately upon waking up. Ulam noted that von Neumann's way of thinking might not be visual, but more aural.\nSection::::Mathematics.\nSection::::Mathematics.:Set theory.\nThe axiomatization of mathematics, on the model of Euclid's \"Elements\", had reached new levels of rigour and breadth at the end of the 19th century, particularly in arithmetic, thanks to the axiom schema of Richard Dedekind and Charles Sanders Peirce, and in geometry, thanks to Hilbert's axioms. But at the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell's paradox (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves). The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics, but they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets\u2014the \"axiom of foundation\" and the notion of \"class.\"\nThe axiom of foundation proposed that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel. If one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession. This excludes the possibility of a set belonging to itself. To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration, called the \"method of inner models\", which later became an essential instrument in set theory.\nThe second approach to the problem of sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion of class, and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a \"proper class\" is defined as a class which does not belong to other classes. Under the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a \"proper class\" and not a set.\nWith this contribution of von Neumann, the axiomatic system of the theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems, and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms that could be used to prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of K\u00f6nigsberg, in which Kurt G\u00f6del announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.\nLess than a month later, von Neumann, who had participated at the Congress, communicated to G\u00f6del an interesting consequence of his theorem: that the usual axiomatic systems are unable to demonstrate their own consistency. However, G\u00f6del had already discovered this consequence, now known as his second incompleteness theorem, and he sent von Neumann a preprint of his article containing both incompleteness theorems. Von Neumann acknowledged G\u00f6del's priority in his next letter. He never thought much of \"the American system of claiming personal priority for everything.\"\nSection::::Mathematics.:Set theory.:Von Neumann Paradox.\nBuilding on the work of Felix Hausdorff, in 1924 Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski proved that given a solid ball in 3\u2011dimensional space, there exists a decomposition of the ball into a finite number of disjoint subsets, that can be reassembled together in a different way to yield two identical copies of the original ball. Banach and Tarski proved that, using isometric transformations, the result of taking apart and reassembling a two-dimensional figure would necessarily have the same area as the original. This would make creating two unit squares out of one impossible. However, in a 1929 paper, von Neumann proved that paradoxical decompositions could use a group of transformations that include as a subgroup a free group with two generators. The group of area-preserving transformations contains such subgroups, and this opens the possibility of performing paradoxical decompositions using these subgroups. The class of groups isolated by von Neumann in his work on Banach\u2013Tarski decompositions subsequently was very important for many areas of mathematics, including von Neumann's own later work in measure theory (see below).\nSection::::Mathematics.:Ergodic theory.\nIn a series of famous papers that were published in 1932, von Neumann made foundational contributions to ergodic theory, a branch of mathematics that involves the states of dynamical systems with an invariant measure. Of the 1932 papers on ergodic theory, Paul Halmos writes that even \"if von Neumann had never done anything else, they would have been sufficient to guarantee him mathematical immortality\". By then von Neumann had already written his famous articles on operator theory, and the application of this work was instrumental in the von Neumann mean ergodic theorem", "Von Neumann was the first to establish a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics, known as the Dirac\u2013von Neumann axioms, with his 1932 work \"Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\". After having completed the axiomatization of set theory, he began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics.

Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players, publishing this result in his 1944 \"Theory of Games and Economic Behavior\" (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern wrote a paper on game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that \"The New York Times\" ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.", "Building on his results on matrix games and on his model of an expanding economy, von Neumann invented the theory of duality in linear programming, after George Dantzig described his work in a few minutes, when an impatient von Neumann asked him to get to the point. Then, Dantzig listened dumbfounded while von Neumann provided an hour lecture on convex sets, fixed-point theory, and duality, conjecturing the equivalence between matrix games and linear programming.\n\nLater, von Neumann suggested a new method of linear programming, using the homogeneous linear system of Paul Gordan (1873), which was later popularized by Karmarkar's algorithm. Von Neumann's method used a pivoting algorithm between simplices, with the pivoting decision determined by a nonnegative least squares subproblem with a convexity constraint (projecting the zero-vector onto the convex hull of the active simplex). Von Neumann's algorithm was the first interior point method of linear programming.\n\nVon Neumann made fundamental contributions to mathematical statistics. In 1941, he derived the exact distribution of the ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables. This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the Durbin\u2013Watson statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the errors are serially independent against the alternative that they follow a stationary first order autoregression.\n\nVon Neumann made fundamental contributions in the field of fluid dynamics.\n\nVon Neumann's contributions to fluid dynamics included his discovery of the classic flow solution to blast waves, and the co-discovery (independently of Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Werner D\u00f6ring) of the ZND detonation model of explosives. During the 1930s, von Neumann became an authority on the mathematics of shaped charges.\n\nVon Neumann made his principal contribution to the atomic bomb in the concept and design of the explosive lenses that were needed to compress the plutonium core of the Fat Man weapon that was later dropped on Nagasaki. While von Neumann did not originate the \"implosion\" concept, he was one of its most persistent proponents, encouraging its continued development against the instincts of many of his colleagues, who felt such a design to be unworkable. He also eventually came up with the idea of using more powerful shaped charges and less fissionable material to greatly increase the speed of \"assembly\".", "Von Neumann is credited with developing the equilibrium strategy of mutual assured destruction (MAD). He also \"moved heaven and earth\" to bring MAD about. His goal was to quickly develop ICBMs and the compact hydrogen bombs that they could deliver to the USSR, and he knew the Soviets were doing similar work because the CIA interviewed German rocket scientists who were allowed to return to Germany, and von Neumann had planted a dozen technical people in the CIA. The Soviets considered that bombers would soon be vulnerable, and they shared von Neumann's view that an H-bomb in an ICBM was the ne plus ultra of weapons; they believed that whoever had superiority in these weapons would take over the world, without necessarily using them. He was afraid of a \"missile gap\" and took several more steps to achieve his goal of keeping up with the Soviets:\nBULLET::::- He modified the ENIAC by making it programmable and then wrote programs for it to do the H-bomb calculations verifying that the Teller-Ulam design was feasible and to develop it further.\nBULLET::::- Through the Atomic Energy Commission, he promoted the development of a compact H-bomb that would fit in an ICBM.\nBULLET::::- He personally interceded to speed up the production of lithium-6 and tritium needed for the compact bombs.\nBULLET::::- He caused several separate missile projects to be started, because he felt that competition combined with collaboration got the best results.\nVon Neumann's assessment that the Soviets had a lead in missile technology, considered pessimistic at the time, was soon proven correct in the Sputnik crisis.\nVon Neumann entered government service primarily because he felt that, if freedom and civilization were to survive, it would have to be because the United States would triumph over totalitarianism from Nazism, Fascism and Soviet Communism. During a Senate committee hearing he described his political ideology as \"violently anti-communist, and much more militaristic than the norm\". He was quoted in 1950 remarking, \"If you say why not bomb [the Soviets] tomorrow, I say, why not today? If you say today at five o'clock, I say why not one o'clock?\"\nOn February 15, 1956, von Neumann was presented with the Medal of Freedom by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. His citation read:\nSection::::Computing.\nVon Neumann was a founding figure in computing. Von Neumann was the inventor, in 1945, of the merge sort algorithm, in which the first and second halves of an array are each sorted recursively and then merged.\nVon Neumann wrote the 23 pages long sorting program for the EDVAC in ink. On the first page, traces of the phrase \"TOP SECRET\", which was written in pencil and later erased, can still be seen. He also worked on the philosophy of artificial intelligence with Alan Turing when the latter visited Princeton in the 1930s.\nVon Neumann's hydrogen bomb work was played out in the realm of computing, where he and Stanis\u0142aw Ulam developed simulations on von Neumann's digital computers for the hydrodynamic computations. During this time he contributed to the development of the Monte Carlo method, which allowed solutions to complicated problems to be approximated using random numbers. \nVon Neumann's algorithm for simulating a fair coin with a biased coin is used in the \"software whitening\" stage of some hardware random number generators. Because using lists of \"truly\" random numbers was extremely slow, von Neumann developed a form of making pseudorandom numbers, using the middle-square method. Though this method has been criticized as crude, von Neumann was aware of this: he justified it as being faster than any other method at his disposal, writing that \"Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.\" Von Neumann also noted that when this method went awry it did so obviously, unlike other methods which could be subtly incorrect.\nWhile consulting for the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania on the EDVAC project, von Neumann wrote an incomplete \"First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC\". The paper, whose premature distribution nullified the patent claims of EDVAC designers J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, described a computer architecture in which the data and the program are both stored in the computer's memory in the same address space. This architecture is the basis of most modern computer designs, unlike the earliest computers that were \"programmed\" using a separate memory device such as a paper tape or plugboard. Although the single-memory, stored program architecture is commonly called von Neumann architecture as a result of von Neumann's paper, the architecture was based on the work of Eckert and Mauchly, inventors of the ENIAC computer at the University of Pennsylvania.\nJohn von Neumann consulted for the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, most notably on the ENIAC project, as a member of its Scientific Advisory Committee.\nThe electronics of the new ENIAC ran at one-sixth the speed, but this in no way degraded the ENIAC's performance, since it was still entirely I/O bound. Complicated programs could be developed and debugged in days rather than the weeks required for plugboarding the old ENIAC. Some of von Neumann's early computer programs have been preserved.\nThe next computer that von Neumann designed was the IAS machine at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He arranged its financing, and the components were designed and built at the RCA Research Laboratory nearby. John von Neumann recommended that the IBM 701, nicknamed \"the defense computer\", include a magnetic drum. It was a faster version of the IAS machine and formed the basis for the commercially successful IBM 704.\nStochastic computing was first introduced in a pioneering paper by von Neumann in 1953.\nHowever, the theory could not be implemented until advances in computing of the 1960s.\nSection::::Computing.:Cellular automata, DNA and the universal constructor.\nVon Neumann's rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA.\nVon Neumann created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper.\nThe detailed proposal for a physical non-biological self-replicating system was first put forward in lectures von Neumann delivered in 1948 and 1949, when he first only proposed a kinematic self-reproducing automaton. While qualitatively sound, von Neumann was evidently dissatisfied with", "Von Neumann and von Neumann created a method for calculating liquid motion in the 1950s. The driving concept of the method was to consider a liquid as a group of discrete units and calculate the motion of each based on its neighbors' behaviors. Like Ulam's lattice network, von Neumann's cellular automata are two-dimensional, with his self-replicator implemented algorithmically. The result was a universal copier and constructor working within a cellular automaton with a small neighborhood (only those cells that touch are neighbors; for von Neumann's cellular automata, only orthogonal cells), and with 29 states per cell. Von Neumann gave an existence proof that a particular pattern would make infinite copies of itself within the given cellular universe by designing a 200,000 cell configuration that could do so.\nVon Neumann addressed the evolutionary growth of complexity amongst his self-replicating machines. His \"proof-of-principle\" designs showed how it is logically possible, by using a general purpose programmable (\"universal\") constructor, to exhibit an indefinitely large class of self-replicators, spanning a wide range of complexity, interconnected by a network of potential mutational pathways, including pathways from the most simple to the most complex. This is an important result, as prior to that it might have been conjectured that there is a fundamental logical barrier to the existence of such pathways; in which case, biological organisms, which do support such pathways, could not be \"machines\", as conventionally understood. Von Neumman considers the potential for conflict between his self-reproducing machines, stating that \"our models lead to such conflict situations\", indicating it as a field of further study.\nThe cybernetics movement highlighted the question of what it takes for self-reproduction to occur autonomously, and in 1952, John von Neumann designed an elaborate 2D cellular automaton that would automatically make a copy of its initial configuration of cells. The von Neumann neighborhood, in which each cell in a two-dimensional grid has the four orthogonally adjacent grid cells as neighbors, continues to be used for other cellular automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth.\nVon Neumann investigated the question of whether modelling evolution on a digital computer could solve the complexity problem in programming.\nBeginning in 1949, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology.", "the influence of a scientist is interpreted broadly enough to include impact on fields beyond science proper, then John von Neumann was probably the most influential mathematician who ever lived,\" wrote Mikl\u00f3s R\u00e9dei in \"John von Neumann: Selected Letters\".

Not only is this tube a literal bottleneck for the data traffic of a problem, but, more importantly, it is an intellectual bottleneck that has kept us tied to word-at-a-time thinking instead of encouraging us to think in terms of the larger conceptual units of the task at hand.

Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\nIt differs from supervised learning in that labelled input/output pairs need not be presented, and sub-optimal actions need not be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).\nThe environment is typically formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), as many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context utilize dynamic programming techniques. The main difference between the classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible.\nThus, reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited to problems that include a long-term versus short-term reward trade-off. It has been applied successfully to various problems, including robot control, elevator scheduling, telecommunications, backgammon, checkers and go (AlphaGo).\nTwo elements make reinforcement learning powerful: the use of samples to optimize performance and the use of function approximation to deal with large environments. Thanks to these two key components, reinforcement learning can be used in large environments in the following situations:\nBULLET::::- A model of the environment is known, but an analytic solution is not available;\nBULLET::::- Only a simulation model of the environment is given (the subject of simulation-based optimization);\nBULLET::::- The only way to collect information about the environment is to interact with it."], "wikipedia-1281850": ["\"Q\"-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. The goal of Q-learning is to learn a policy, which tells an agent what action to take under what circumstances. It does not require a model (hence the connotation \"model-free\") of the environment, and it can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards, without requiring adaptations.\nFor any finite Markov decision process (FMDP), \"Q\"-learning finds a policy that is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the expected value of the total reward over any and all successive steps, starting from the current state. \"Q\"-learning can identify an optimal action-selection policy for any given FMDP, given infinite exploration time and a partly-random policy. \"Q\" names the function that returns the reward used to provide the reinforcement and can be said to stand for the \"quality\" of an action taken in a given state.\nSection::::Reinforcement learning.\nReinforcement learning involves an agent, a set of \"states\" , and a set of \"actions\" per state. By performing an action formula_1, the agent transitions from state to state. Executing an action in a specific state provides the agent with a \"reward\" (a numerical score). \nThe goal of the agent is to maximize its total (future) reward. It does this by adding the maximum reward attainable from future states to the reward for achieving its current state, effectively influencing the current action by the potential future reward. This potential reward is a weighted sum of the expected values of the rewards of all future steps starting from the current state."], "wikipedia-1125883": ["The solution for an MDP is a policy which describes the best action for each state in the MDP, known as the optimal policy. This optimal policy can be found through a variety of methods, like dynamic programming.\nSome dynamic programming solutions require knowledge of the state transition function formula_45 and the reward function formula_46. Others can solve for the optimal policy of an MDP using experimentation alone.\nConsider the case in which state transition function formula_45 and reward function formula_46 for an MDP are given, and we seek the optimal policy formula_49 that maximizes the expected discounted reward.\nThe standard family of algorithms to calculate this optimal policy requires storage for two arrays indexed by state: \"value\" formula_50, which contains real values, and \"policy\" formula_30, which contains actions. At the end of the algorithm, formula_30 will contain the solution and formula_53 will contain the discounted sum of the rewards to be earned (on average) by following that solution from state formula_1.\nThe algorithm has two steps, (1) a value update and (2) a policy update, which are repeated in some order for all the states until no further changes take place. Both recursively update \na new estimation of the optimal policy and state value using an older estimation of those values.\nTheir order depends on the variant of the algorithm; one can also do them for all states at once or state by state, and more often to some states than others. As long as no state is permanently excluded from either of the steps, the algorithm will eventually arrive at the correct solution.\nSection::::Algorithms.:Notable variants.:Value iteration.\nIn value iteration , which is also called backward induction,\nthe formula_30 function is not used; instead, the value of formula_31 is calculated within formula_53 whenever it is needed. Substituting the calculation of formula_31 into the calculation of formula_53 gives the combined step:\nwhere formula_63 is the iteration number. Value iteration starts at formula_64 and formula_65 as a guess of the value function. It then iterates, repeatedly computing formula_66 for all states formula_1, until formula_50 converges with the left-hand side equal to the right-hand side (which is the \"Bellman equation\" for this problem). Lloyd Shapley's 1953 paper on stochastic games included as a special case the value iteration method for MDPs, but this was recognized only later on.\nSection::::Algorithms.:Notable variants.:Policy iteration.\nIn policy iteration , step one is performed once, and then step two is repeated until it converges. Then step one is again performed once and so on.\nInstead of repeating step two to convergence, it may be formulated and solved as a set of linear equations. These equations are merely obtained by making formula_69 in the step two equation. Thus, repeating step two to convergence can be interpreted as solving the linear equations by Relaxation (iterative method)\nThis variant has the advantage that there is a definite stopping condition: when the array formula_30 does not change in the course of applying step 1 to all states, the algorithm is completed.\nPolicy iteration is usually slower than value iteration for a large number of possible states.\nSection::::Algorithms.:Notable variants.:Modified policy iteration.\nIn modified policy iteration (; ), step one is performed once, and then step two is repeated several times. Then step one is again performed once and so on.\nSection::::Algorithms.:Notable variants.:Prioritized sweeping.\nIn this variant, the steps are preferentially applied to states which are in some way important \u2013 whether based on the algorithm (there were large changes in formula_50 or formula_30 around those states recently) or based on use (those states are near the starting state, or otherwise of interest to the person or program using the algorithm).\nSection::::Extensions and generalizations.:Reinforcement learning.\nIf the probabilities or rewards are unknown, the problem is one of reinforcement learning.\nFor this purpose it is useful to define a further function, which corresponds to taking the action formula_2 and then continuing optimally (or according to whatever policy one currently has):\nWhile this function is also unknown, experience during learning is based on formula_77 pairs (together with the outcome formula_4; that is, \"I was in state formula_1 and I tried doing formula_2 and formula_4 happened\"). Thus, one has an array formula_82 and uses experience to update it directly. This is known as Q-learning.\nReinforcement learning can solve Markov decision processes without explicit specification of the transition probabilities; the values of the transition probabilities are needed in value and policy iteration. In reinforcement learning, instead of explicit specification of the transition probabilities, the transition probabilities are accessed through a simulator that is typically restarted many times from a uniformly random initial state.

Therefore, RL has been limited to learning only for action, and human designers have to design how to construct state space from sensor signals and to give how the motion commands are generated for each action before learning. Neural networks have been often used in RL, to provide non-linear function approximation to avoid the curse of dimensionality. Recurrent neural networks have been also employed, mainly to avoid perceptual aliasing or partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).\nEnd-to-end RL extends RL from learning only for actions to learning the entire process from sensors to motors including higher-level functions that are difficult to develop independently from other functions.
