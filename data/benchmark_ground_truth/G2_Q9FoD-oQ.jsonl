Wikipedia pages on cipher machines (e.g., Enigma machine, rotor machines) explain their mechanisms, such as using rotors, substitution ciphers, or electronic circuits to scramble plaintext into ciphertext. These pages also discuss their historical and modern roles in secure communications, making them a reliable source for answering the query.", "wikipedia-5244": ["In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption\u2014a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is \"encipherment\". To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, \"cipher\" is synonymous with \"code\", as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.\n\nThe operation of a cipher usually depends on a piece of auxiliary information, called a key (or, in traditional NSA parlance, a \"cryptovariable\"). The encrypting procedure is varied depending on the key, which changes the detailed operation of the algorithm. A key must be selected before using a cipher to encrypt a message. Without knowledge of the key, it should be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to decrypt the resulting ciphertext into readable plaintext.\n\nMost modern ciphers can be categorized in several ways\nBULLET::::- By whether they work on blocks of symbols usually of a fixed size (block ciphers), or on a continuous stream of symbols (stream ciphers).\nBULLET::::- By whether the same key is used for both encryption and decryption (symmetric key algorithms), or if a different key is used for each (asymmetric key algorithms). If the algorithm is symmetric, the key must be known to the recipient and sender and to no one else. If the algorithm is an asymmetric one, the enciphering key is different from, but closely related to, the deciphering key. If one key cannot be deduced from the other, the asymmetric key algorithm has the public/private key property and one of the keys may be made public without loss of confidentiality.\n\nDuring the early twentieth century, electro-mechanical machines were invented to do encryption and decryption using transposition, polyalphabetic substitution, and a kind of \"additive\" substitution. In rotor machines, several rotor disks provided polyalphabetic substitution, while plug boards provided another substitution. Keys were easily changed by changing the rotor disks and the plugboard wires. Although these encryption methods were more complex than previous schemes and required machines to encrypt and decrypt, other machines such as the British Bombe were invented to crack these encryption methods."], "wikipedia-196223": ["In cryptography, a rotor machine is an electro-mechanical stream cipher device used for encrypting and decrypting secret messages. Rotor machines were the cryptographic state-of-the-art for a prominent period of history; they were in widespread use in the 1920s\u20131970s. The most famous example is the German Enigma machine, whose messages were deciphered by the Allies during World War II, producing intelligence code-named \"Ultra\".\nThe primary component is a set of \"rotors\", also termed \"wheels\" or \"drums\", which are rotating disks with an array of electrical contacts on either side. The wiring between the contacts implements a fixed substitution of letters, replacing them in some complex fashion. On its own, this would offer little security; however, after encrypting each letter, the rotors advance positions, changing the substitution.

The wiring is placed inside a rotor, and then rotated with a gear every time a letter was pressed. So while pressing A the first time might generate a Q, the next time it might generate a J. Every letter pressed on the keyboard would spin the rotor and get a new substitution, implementing a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.\n\nDepending on the size of the rotor, this may or may not be more secure than hand ciphers. If the rotor has only 26 positions on it, one for each letter, then all messages will have a (repeating) key 26 letters long. Although the key itself (mostly hidden in the wiring of the rotor) might not be known, the methods for attacking these types of ciphers don't need that information. So while such a \"single rotor\" machine is certainly easy to use, it's no more secure than any other partial polyalphabetic cipher system.\n\nBut this is easy to correct. Simply stack more rotors next to each other, and gear them together. After the first rotor spins \"all the way\", make the rotor beside it spin one position. Now you would have to type 26 \u00d7 26 = 676 letters (for the Latin alphabet) before the key repeats, and yet it still only requires you to communicate a key of two letters/numbers to set things up. If a key of 676 length is not long enough, another rotor can be added, resulting in a period 17,576 letters long.\n\nIn order to be as easy to decipher as encipher, some rotor machines, most notably the Enigma machine, were designed to be \"symmetrical\", i.e., encrypting twice with the same settings recovers the original message (see involution)."], "wikipedia-520066": ["In 1917, Gilbert Vernam proposed a teleprinter cipher in which a previously prepared key, kept on paper tape, is combined character by character with the plaintext message to produce the cyphertext. This led to the development of electromechanical devices as cipher machines, and to the only unbreakable cipher, the one time pad. By World War II, mechanical and electromechanical cipher machines were in wide use, although\u2014where such machines were impractical\u2014code books and manual systems continued in use. Great advances were made in both cipher design and cryptanalysis, all in secrecy. The Germans made heavy use, in several variants, of an electromechanical rotor machine known as Enigma. Allied cipher machines used in World War II included the British TypeX and the American SIGABA; both were electromechanical rotor designs similar in spirit to the Enigma, albeit with major improvements. Neither is known to have been broken by anyone during the War."], "wikipedia-5715": ["During World War I, inventors in several countries developed rotor cipher machines such as Arthur Scherbius' Enigma, in an attempt to minimise the repetition that had been exploited to break the Vigen\u00e8re system.\n\nWith reciprocal machine ciphers such as the Lorenz cipher and the Enigma machine used by Nazi Germany during World War II, each message had its own key. Usually, the transmitting operator informed the receiving operator of this message key by transmitting some plaintext and/or ciphertext before the enciphered message. This is termed the \"indicator\", as it indicates to the receiving operator how to set his machine to decipher the message."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-5244": 1, "wikipedia-196223": 3, "wikipedia-3201589": 1, "wikipedia-520066": 1, "wikipedia-5715": 1, "wikipedia-18934432": 1, "wikipedia-4296490": 1, "wikipedia-38472580": 1, "wikipedia-450714": 1, "wikipedia-439526": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-5244": 2, "wikipedia-196223": 3, "wikipedia-3201589": 1, "wikipedia-520066": 2, "wikipedia-5715": 2, "wikipedia-18934432": 1, "wikipedia-4296490": 1, "wikipedia-38472580": 1, "wikipedia-450714": 1, "wikipedia-439526": 1}}}

As well as explaining the science of codes and describing the impact of cryptography on history, the book also contends that cryptography is more important today than ever before. \"The Code Book\" has resulted in a return to television for him. He presented \"The Science of Secrecy\", a five-part series for Channel 4. The stories in the series range from the cipher that sealed the fate of Mary, Queen of Scots, to the coded Zimmermann Telegram that changed the course of the First World War.

In typical use, one person enters text on the Enigma\u2019s keyboard and another person writes down which of 26 lights above the keyboard lights up at each key press.

The rotor mechanism changes the electrical connections between the keys and the lights with each keypress. The security of the system depends on Enigma machine settings that were changed daily, based on secret key lists distributed in advance, and on other settings that change for each message. The receiving station has to know and use the exact settings employed by the transmitting station to successfully decrypt a message.\n\nThe mechanical subsystem consists of a keyboard; a set of rotating disks called \"rotors\" arranged adjacently along a spindle; one of various stepping components to turn at least one rotor with each key press, and a series of lamps, one for each letter.\n\nThe mechanical parts act in such a way as to form a varying electrical circuit. When a key is pressed, one or more rotors rotate on the spindle. On the sides of the rotors are a series of electrical contacts that, after rotation, line up with contacts on the other rotors or fixed wiring on either end of the spindle. When the rotors are properly aligned, each key on the keyboard is connected to a unique electrical pathway through the series of contacts and internal wiring. Current, typically from a battery, flows through the pressed key, into the newly configured set of circuits and back out again, ultimately lighting one display lamp, which shows the output letter. For example, when encrypting a message starting \"ANX...\", the operator would first press the \"A\" key, and the \"Z\" lamp might light, so \"Z\" would be the first letter of the ciphertext. The operator would next press \"N\", and then \"X\" in the same fashion, and so on.\n\nThe repeated changes of electrical path through an Enigma scrambler implemented a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that provided Enigma's security.

Consequently, the Germans took the precaution of sending the message key twice; if there was a garble, the recipient should be able to find the message key.

The Poles' early start at breaking Enigma and the continuity of their success, gave the Allies an advantage when World War II began."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-56714651": 1, "wikipedia-625326": 3, "wikipedia-3202161": 1, "wikipedia-546049": 1, "wikipedia-905870": 1, "wikipedia-9130247": 1, "wikipedia-16017967": 1, "wikipedia-1241597": 1, "wikipedia-31748": 3, "wikipedia-40281611": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-56714651": 1, "wikipedia-625326": 3, "wikipedia-3202161": 2, "wikipedia-546049": 1, "wikipedia-905870": 2, "wikipedia-9130247": 1, "wikipedia-16017967": 2, "wikipedia-1241597": 1, "wikipedia-31748": 3, "wikipedia-40281611": 2}}}

However, Wikipedia may not provide a detailed step-by-step visualization without additional diagrams or external resources.", "wikipedia-30991077": ["The switch used to control a 3-way lamp is usually a rotary switch or a pull-chain switch. Although it is referred to as a 3-way switch, it has four positions, off, lamp one (low), lamp two (medium), and lamps one and two (high). When properly connected to a 3-way socket containing a 3-way bulb, this switch will first power one filament, then the other filament, then both, then return to the off position. To do this, the switch must be capable of operating two different circuits. Internal to the switch there are two sets of switch contacts that are not connected electrically, but which are connected mechanically in such a way that they operate together as shown in this table."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-270770": 1, "wikipedia-25141332": 1, "wikipedia-34509161": 1, "wikipedia-217946": 1, "wikipedia-59503751": 1, "wikipedia-11450265": 1, "wikipedia-14981459": 1, "wikipedia-25383505": 1, "wikipedia-30991077": 1, "wikipedia-7649490": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-270770": 1, "wikipedia-25141332": 1, "wikipedia-34509161": 1, "wikipedia-217946": 1, "wikipedia-59503751": 1, "wikipedia-11450265": 1, "wikipedia-14981459": 1, "wikipedia-25383505": 1, "wikipedia-30991077": 2, "wikipedia-7649490": 1}}}

He argues three different positions because \"decodings do not follow inevitably from encodings\". Thus, just because a message is encoded on television in a particular way, it does not mean it will be decoded in its intended format. This lays the foundation for Hall's hypothetical positions\u2014he needs multiple positions because there are multiple interpretations that could occur. These positions are known as the dominant-hegemonic position, the negotiated position, and the oppositional position.\nThe first position that he discusses is the dominant-hegemonic code. This code or position is one where the consumer takes the actual meaning directly, and decodes it exactly the way it was encoded. For instance, political and military elites primarily generated the politics of Northern Ireland and the Chilean Coup. These elites created the \"hegemonic interpretations\" Because these ideas were hegemonic interpretations, they became dominant. Hall demonstrates that if a viewer of a newscast on such topics decoded the message \"in terms of the reference code in which it has been encoded\" that the viewer would be \"operating inside the dominant code\" Thus, the dominant code involves taking the connotative meaning of a message in the exact way a sender intended a message to be interpreted (decoded). Under this framework, the consumer is located within the dominant point of view, and is fully sharing the texts codes and accepts and reproduces the intended meaning. Here, there is barely any misunderstanding because both the sender and receiver have the same cultural biases. This means that the intended message was created by the dominant class and that the recipient was also a part of the dominant point of view. \nAnother hypothetical position is the negotiated position. This position is a mixture of accepting and rejecting elements. Readers are acknowledging the dominant message, but are not willing to completely accept the message the way the encoder intended. The reader to a certain extent, shares the text's code and generally accepts the preferred meaning, but is simultaneously resisting and modifying it in a way which reflects their own experiences and interests.\nHall explains this when he states \"decoding within the negotiated version contains a mixture of adaptive and oppositional elements: it acknowledges the legitimacy of the hegemonic definitions to make the grand significations (abstract), while, at a more restricted, situational (situated) level, it makes its own ground rules- it operates with exceptions to the rule\". Basically, this means that people understand the dominant position, they generally believe the position, but they are in a situation where they must make up their own separate rules to coexist with the dominant position.\nLastly, there is the oppositional position or code. Hall summarizes that a viewer can understand the literal (denotative) and connotative meanings of a message while decoding a message in a globally contrary way. This means that a person recognizes that their meaning is not the dominant meaning, or what was intended, but alters the message in their mind to fit an \"alternative framework of reference\" Thus, readers' or viewers social situation has placed them in a directly oppositional relationship to the dominant code, and although they understand the intended meaning they do not share the text's code and end up rejecting it. Again, this code is based very much on experiences. One's personal experiences will likely influence them to take on the oppositional position when they encode hegemonic positions.

The fraction 0.538 falls into the sub-interval for NEUTRAL, [0, 0.6); this indicates that the first symbol the encoder read must have been NEUTRAL, so this is the first symbol of the message.\nNext divide the interval [0, 0.6) into sub-intervals:\nBULLET::::- the interval for NEUTRAL would be [0, 0.36), \"60% of [0, 0.6)\".\nBULLET::::- the interval for POSITIVE would be [0.36, 0.48), \"20% of [0, 0.6)\".\nBULLET::::- the interval for NEGATIVE would be [0.48, 0.54), \"10% of [0, 0.6)\".\nBULLET::::- the interval for END-OF-DATA would be [0.54, 0.6), \"10% of [0, 0.6)\".\nSince .538 is within the interval [0.48, 0.54), the second symbol of the message must have been NEGATIVE.\nAgain divide our current interval into sub-intervals:\nBULLET::::- the interval for NEUTRAL would be [0.48, 0.516).\nBULLET::::- the interval for POSITIVE would be [0.516, 0.528).\nBULLET::::- the interval for NEGATIVE would be [0.528, 0.534).\nBULLET::::- the interval for END-OF-DATA would be [0.534, 0.540).\nNow 0.538 falls within the interval of the END-OF-DATA symbol; therefore, this must be the next symbol. Since it is also the internal termination symbol, it means the decoding is complete. If the stream is not internally terminated, there needs to be some other way to indicate where the stream stops.

He is neither officer nor man. The men do not respect him as an officer, and he is obliged to go aloft to reef and furl the topsails, and to put his hands into the tar and slush, with the rest. The crew call him the \"sailor's waiter,\" as he has to furnish them with spun-yarn, marline, and all other stuffs that they need in their work, and has charge of the boatswain's locker, which includes serving-boards, marline-spikes, etc. He is expected by the captain to maintain his dignity and to enforce obedience, and still is kept at a great distance from the mate, and obliged to work with the crew. He is one to whom little is given and of whom much is required. His wages are usually double those of a common sailor, and he eats and sleeps in the cabin; but he is obliged to be on deck nearly all the time, and eats at the second table, that is, makes a meal out of what the captain and chief mate leave.\nHowever, the role of the second mate officer (or any subordinate officer) was then very much determined by the Captain of a ship. So, as the author has described ,it is not necessarily the case with the officer in other ships. Nowadays, the role of a second officer on board any ship is that of a navigating officer; he is in charge of navigation, navigational equipment and navigational publications. He reports to the captain of the ship. Deck work charge is not expected on a second officer but he may do so. He is a certified officer on board."], "wikipedia-9256": ["A German Enigma operator would be given a plaintext message to encrypt. After setting up his machine, he would type the message on the Enigma keyboard. For each letter pressed, one lamp lit indicating a different letter according to a pseudo-random substitution determined by the electrical pathways inside the machine. The letter indicated by the lamp would be recorded, typically by a second operator, as the cyphertext letter. The action of pressing a key also moved one or more rotors so that the next key press used a different electrical pathway, and thus a different substitution would occur even if the same plaintext letter were entered again. For each key press there was rotation of at least the right hand rotor and less often the other two, resulting in a different substitution alphabet being used for every letter in the message. This process continued until the message was completed. The cyphertext recorded by the second operator would then be transmitted, usually by radio in Morse code, to an operator of another Enigma machine. This operator would type in the cyphertext and \u2014 as long as all the settings of the deciphering machine were identical to those of the enciphering machine \u2014 for every key press the reverse substitution would occur and the plaintext message would emerge."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Other duties vary, but the second mate is often the medical officer and in charge of maintaining distress signaling equipment. On oil tankers, the second mate usually assists the chief mate with the Cargo operations.\nThe Navigator's role focuses on creating the ship's passage plans. A passage plan is a comprehensive, step by step description of how the voyage is to proceed from berth to berth or one port to another. The plan includes undocking, departure, the en route portion of a voyage, approach, and mooring at the destination.\nOn the ship the second officer is the officer that works under the Master, i.e. the Captain of the ship and shoulders the responsibility of checking the functionality of all the navigational equipment, such as the Echo-sounder, Radar, ECDIS, AIS, and on some vessels even the GMDSS radio equipment, however recently it has been observed that Companies tend to designate the responsibility of maintaining the GMDSS equipment to the third officer.

For example, if there are 5 rotors available, the first position can be any of 5, the second any of the remaining 4, and the third any of the remaining 3, resulting in 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 = 60 possible arrangements.

The desk has a row of switches and two rows of plugs attached to cables that retract into the desk when not in use. Each pair of plugs was part of a cord circuit with a switch associated that let the operator participate in the call or ring the circuit for an incoming call. Each jack had a light above it that lit when the customer's telephone receiver was lifted (the earliest systems required the customer to hand-crank a magneto to alert the central office and, later, to \"ring off\" the completed call). Lines from the central office were usually arranged along the bottom row. Before the advent of operator distance dialing and customer direct dial (DDD) calling, switchboard operators would work with their counterparts in the distant central office to complete long distance calls. Switchboard operators are typically required to have very strong communication skills.\nBefore the advent of automatic exchanges, an operator's assistance was required for anything other than calling telephones across a shared party line. Callers spoke to an operator at a Central Office who then connected a cord to the proper circuit in order to complete the call. Being in complete control of the call, the operator was in a position to listen to private conversations. Automatic, or Dial systems were developed in the 1920s to reduce labor costs as usage increased, and to ensure privacy to the customer. As phone systems became more sophisticated, less direct intervention by the telephone operator was necessary to complete calls. With the development of computerized telephone dialing systems, many telephone calls which previously required a live operator can be placed automatically by the calling party without additional human intervention."], "wikipedia-28427": ["A telephone switchboard is a telecommunications system used in the public switched telephone network or in enterprises to interconnect circuits of telephones to establish telephone calls between the subscribers or users, or between other exchanges. The switchboard was an essential component of a manual telephone exchange, and was operated by switchboard operators who used electrical cords or switches to establish the connections."], "wikipedia-258959": ["The phone connector was invented for use in telephone switchboards in the 19th century and is still widely used."], "wikipedia-26668156": ["Later exchanges consisted of one to several hundred plug boards staffed by switchboard operators.

In front of the jack panel lay a horizontal panel containing two rows of patch cords, each pair connected to a cord circuit.\n\nWhen a calling party lifted the receiver, the local loop current lit a signal lamp near the jack. The operator responded by inserting the rear cord (\"answering cord\") into the subscriber's jack and switched her headset into the circuit to ask, \"Number, please?\" For a local call, the operator inserted the front cord of the pair (\"ringing cord\") into the called party's local jack and started the ringing cycle.

Division is mainly practiced by gardeners and very small nurseries, as most commercial plant propagation is now done through plant tissue culture.\nDivision is one of the three main methods used by gardeners to increase stocks of plants (the other two are seed-sowing and cuttings). Division is usually applied to mature perennial plants, but may also be used for shrubs with suckering roots, such as gaultheria, kerria and sarcococca. Annual and biennial plants do not lend themselves to this procedure, as their lifespan is too short.\nMost perennials are best divided and replanted every few years to keep them healthy. They may also be divided in order to produce new plants. Those with woody crowns or fleshy roots need to be cut apart, while others can be prized apart using garden forks or hand forks.

Critical areas also protect the ILS system's internal monitoring.\n\nILS technology delivers two main types of information to pilots.

However, deeper technical details may require additional sources.", "wikipedia-838989": ["In cryptology, a code is a method used to encrypt a message that operates at the level of meaning; that is, words or phrases are converted into something else. A code might transform \"change\" into \"CVGDK\" or \"cocktail lounge\". The U.S. National Security Agency defined a code as \"A substitution cryptosystem in which the plaintext elements are primarily words, phrases, or sentences, and the code equivalents (called \"code groups\") typically consist of letters or digits (or both) in otherwise meaningless combinations of identical length.\" A \"codebook\" is needed to encrypt, and decrypt the phrases or words.\n\nBy contrast, ciphers encrypt messages at the level of individual letters, or small groups of letters, or even, in modern ciphers, individual bits. Messages can be transformed first by a code, and then by a cipher. Such multiple encryption, or \"superencryption\" aims to make cryptanalysis more difficult.\n\nAnother comparison between codes and ciphers is that a code typically represents a letter or groups of letters directly without the use of mathematics. As such the numbers are configured to represent these three values: 1001 = A, 1002 = B, 1003 = C, ... . The resulting message, then would be 1001 1002 1003 to communicate ABC. Ciphers, however, utilize a mathematical formula to represent letters or groups of letters. For example, A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ... . Thus the message ABC results by multiplying each letter's value by 13. The message ABC, then would be 13 26 39.\n\nCodes are defined by \"codebooks\" (physical or notional), which are dictionaries of codegroups listed with their corresponding plaintext. Codes originally had the codegroups assigned in 'plaintext order' for convenience of the code designed, or the encoder. For example, in a code using numeric code groups, a plaintext word starting with \"a\" would have a low-value group, while one starting with \"z\" would have a high-value group. The same codebook could be used to \"encode\" a plaintext message into a coded message or \"codetext\", and \"decode\" a codetext back into plaintext message.\n\nIn order to make life more difficult for codebreakers, codemakers designed codes with no predictable relationship between the codegroups and the ordering of the matching plaintext. In practice, this meant that two codebooks were now required, one to find codegroups for encoding, the other to look up codegroups to find plaintext for decoding. Such \"two-part\" codes required more effort to develop, and twice as much effort to distribute (and discard safely when replaced), but they were harder to break. The Zimmermann Telegram in January 1917 used the German diplomatic \"0075\" two-part code system which contained upwards of 10,000 phrases and individual words."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-55728021": 1, "wikipedia-3989298": 1, "wikipedia-3201589": 1, "wikipedia-16017967": 1, "wikipedia-1940782": 1, "wikipedia-24516513": 1, "wikipedia-1062532": 1, "wikipedia-50373": 1, "wikipedia-53157079": 1, "wikipedia-838989": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-55728021": 1, "wikipedia-3989298": 1, "wikipedia-3201589": 1, "wikipedia-16017967": 1, "wikipedia-1940782": 1, "wikipedia-24516513": 1, "wikipedia-1062532": 1, "wikipedia-50373": 1, "wikipedia-53157079": 1, "wikipedia-838989": 2}}}

All human skills are implemented biologically, using machinery designed by the process of natural selection. In the course of their evolution, natural selection has tended to preserve design improvements and optimizations. The older a skill is, the more time natural selection has had to improve the design. Abstract thought developed only very recently, and consequently, we should not expect its implementation to be particularly efficient.\nSome examples of skills that have been evolving for millions of years: recognizing a face, moving around in space, judging people\u2019s motivations, catching a ball, recognizing a voice, setting appropriate goals, paying attention to things that are interesting; anything to do with perception, attention, visualization, motor skills, social skills and so on.\nSome examples of skills that have appeared more recently: mathematics, engineering, human games, logic and scientific reasoning.

For instance, groupware often requires users to learn a new system, which users may perceive as creating more work for them without much benefit. If team members are not willing to learn and adopt groupware, it is difficult (if not impossible) for the organization to develop the requisite critical mass for the groupware to be useful. Further, research has found that groupware requires careful implementation into a group setting, and product developers have not as yet been able to find the most optimal way to introduce such systems into organizational environments.\nOn the technical side, networking issues with groupware often create challenges in using groupware for CSCW. While access to the Internet is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, geographically dispersed users still face challenges of differing network conditions. For instance, web conferencing can be quite challenging if some members have a very slow connection and others are able to utilize high speed connections.\nIdeally, system designs will accommodate all team members, but orienting older workers to new CSCW tools can often be difficult.

Coding text and theorizing: In grounded theory research, the search for the theory starts with the very first line of the very first interview that one codes. It involves taking a small chunk of the text where line by line is being coded. Useful concepts are being identified where key phrases are being marked. The concepts are named. Another chunk of text is then taken and the above-mentioned steps are being repeated. According to Strauss and Corbin, this process is called open coding and Charmaz called it initial coding. Basically, this process is breaking data into conceptual components. The next step involves a lot more theorizing, as in when coding is being done examples are being pulled out, examples of concepts together and think about how each concept can be related to a larger more inclusive concept. This involves the constant comparative method and it goes on throughout the grounding theory process, right up through the development of complete theories.\nBULLET::::2. Memoing and theorizing: Memoing is the process by which the running notes of each of the concepts that are being identified are kept. It is the intermediate step between the coding and the first draft of the completed analysis. Memos are field notes about the concepts in which one lays out their observations and insights. Memoing starts with the first concept that has been identified and continues right through the process of breaking the text and of building theories.\nBULLET::::3. Integrating, refining and writing up theories: Once coding categories emerge, the next step is to link them together in theoretical models around a central category that hold everything together. The constant comparative method comes into play, along with negative case analysis which looks for cases that do not confirm the model. Basically one generates a model about how whatever one is studying works right from the first interview and see if the model holds up as one analyze more interviews.\nTheorizing is involved in all these steps.

It may be done through a range of attacks (active and passive) including injecting traffic, decrypting traffic, and dictionary-based attacks.\n\nAs mentioned above, several types of attacks are possible. More precisely they are:\n- Decrypting traffic based on tricking access points (active attack)\n- Injecting traffic based on known plaintext (active attack)\n- Gathering traffic and performing brute force/dictionary based attacks\n- Decrypting traffic using statistical analysis (passive attack)\n\nInjecting traffic means inserting forged encrypted messages into the network. It may be done if either the key is known (to generate new messages), or if the key is not known and only an encrypted message and plaintext message is gathered, through comparison of the two. Programs able to do the latter are Aireplay and WepWedgie.\n\nDecryption often requires 2 tools; 1 for gathering packets and another for analysing the packet and determining the key. Gathering packets may be done through tools such as WireShark or Prismdump and cracking may be done through tools such as WEPCrack, AirSnort, AirCrack, and WEPLab.\n\nWhen gathering packets, often a great amount of them are required to perform cracking. Depending on the attack used, 5-16 million frames may be required. The attack command itself, however, is surprisingly simple.\n\nCommands to be inputted into WEPCrack are:\nperl \\progra~1\\wepcrack\\pcap-getIV.pl\nThis command generates a log-file (ivfile.log) from a captured packet obtained by WireShark or prismdump A packet with at least 5 million frames is required.\nperl \\progra~1\\wepcrack\\wepcrack\\.pl ivfile.log\nThis command asks WEPCrack to determine the key from the log file.\n\nAircrack is another program that's even simpler to use, as no command need to be entered; instead the user is asked to type in some parameters and click some buttons.\nFirst airodump is started to gather the packets; herefore channel and MAC-filter are asked, yet the user does not need to know them per se (instead 0 and p may be inputted respectively). Then, AirCrack is started, the file just created by airodump is accessed, a 0 needs to be entered and the program determines the key.\n\nAirSnort is an even simpler program, as it is completely interface-based.

Sometimes a board to be broken is held lightly between two fingers by a person; an advanced \"dan\" test may involve an attempt to break a board as it falls through the air. Regardless of the strength of the striker, the board will only break if it is struck with sufficient velocity.\nAnother type of \"Speed Break\" is that which involves breaking a number of objects over a given amount of time. A common time span is 1 minute, but this can vary depending on the material and venue. In competition it is very common for a speed breaking category to limit the time to 8\u201310 seconds, enabling more competitors to participate. Records and specifics are kept track of by leading martial arts breaking organizations such as the USBA/WBA (United States and World Breaking Associations) and the ISKA (International Sports Karate Association).\n\"Power breaks\" are breaks where the striking object is supported. Either the break will employ human holders for horizontal, angular, or upward vertical strikes, or the break will require that the objects be stacked for downward vertical strikes. For a stacked break the object is placed on sturdy supporting objects, such as concrete blocks, that are placed on the ground. Many color belt (belts before black belt) promotion testing breaks are power breaks\u2014it is substantially easier for an inexperienced person to muster sufficient energy to break a wooden board with a power break (Note, this is not true for all breaks). The vast majority of these employ human board holders. Often a stronger or more powerful striker may substitute some strength for technique and successfully accomplish the break. Most records that are catalogued are for power breaks. It is very common for black belt tests to use bricks, concrete patio blocks, or several boards stacked on top of supporting objects for challenging downward strikes.\nTaped boards are sometimes used to lessen the amount of human influence from the holders for a break. It is very difficult to hold a stack of boards more than 4 inches steadily enough for challenging break. Therefore, some strikers will tape a stack of boards together to make a \"brick\" for their holders to hold. Usually however, test breaks at promotions and events are done without taped boards.\nBoth the speed and power breaks deliver the energy required to overcome the tensor and flexion forces of the board through \"mass displacement\", where the kinetic energy is given by 1/2 m*v. That is, either the speed of the striking implement (hand/foot/etc.) has to be high enough, or the striker must be strong enough to increase effective mass brought into the break (i.e. his or her body weight) to exceed the brick/board's threshold. For single boards, it is generally easy (as in the casual person has a sufficient reserve of mass) to reach this threshold through a power break.\nThe third method, \"soft breaks\", also known as \"ki\" breaks almost always involve the use of \"flat hand\" strikes; primarily the palm, as it's easier to accomplish a successful break with forward momentum, but sometimes the back of the hand (in a semi outstretched configuration) it utilized to exhibit the person's prowess, as this alternate method usually entails certain conditioning of the hand to endure the stress of impact (see note on Wolff's Law above) as well as using a less natural arm position when delivering the blow."], "wikipedia-1404417": ["BULLET::::1. Coding text and theorizing: In grounded theory research, the search for the theory starts with the very first line of the very first interview that one codes. It involves taking a small chunk of the text where line by line is being coded. Useful concepts are being identified where key phrases are being marked. The concepts are named. Another chunk of text is then taken and the above-mentioned steps are being repeated. According to Strauss and Corbin, this process is called open coding and Charmaz called it initial coding. Basically, this process is breaking data into conceptual components. The next step involves a lot more theorizing, as in when coding is being done examples are being pulled out, examples of concepts together and think about how each concept can be related to a larger more inclusive concept. This involves the constant comparative method and it goes on throughout the grounding theory process, right up through the development of complete theories.\nBULLET::::2.

The reason for this, was they were unable to conduct sufficiently deep security tests to determine how secure they were. They were also unable to put forth the costly practical effort required to solve them. Their security tests were theoretical only, and they were unable to imagine what a large concerted effort at traffic analysis could achieve. A security measure which would have proved productive, was the issue of new Enigma rotors. However, so many Enigma machines were out in the field, that it would prove impractical to update them. OKW/Chi also felt that even if a particular Enigma unit was captured, it would still be considered secure, since no process was known by OKW/Chi that could break it. They also had not advanced sufficiently in cryptology to realize what could be achieved by a large combined engineering team.

Hasenjaeger could take some comfort from the fact that even Alan Turing missed this weakness. Instead the honour was attributed to Gordon Welchman, who used the knowledge to decrypt several hundred thousand Enigma messages during the war. In fact fixed points were earlier used by Polish codebreaker, Henryk Zygalski, as the basis for his method of attack on Enigma cipher, referred to by the Poles as \"Zygalski sheets\" (Zygalski sheets) (p\u0142achty Zygalskiego) and by the British as the \"Netz method\"."], "wikipedia-2774229": ["However, the sender needed to communicate the message key to the recipient in order for the recipient to decrypt the message.

Consequently, the Germans took the precaution of sending the message key twice; if there was a garble, the recipient should be able to find the message key. Here, the Germans committed a crucial error. Instead of sending the encrypted message key (e.g., \"PKP\") twice to get \"PKP PKP\", the Germans doubled the message key (e.g., \"ABL ABL\"), encrypted the doubled key to get (\"PKP JXI\"), and sent the encrypted doubled key.

The Wehrmacht had a generally uneasy feeling regarding Enigma and their own key processes and missed a number of opportunities to definitively prove this. These were:\nBULLET::::- In October 1939, captured Polish prisoners of war, one called Ru\u017aek stated under interrogation that the Enigma was being worked on [in Poland] in conjunction with the French. This was the result of three deciphered German messages being found by the Germans in a captured Spanish ship in 1939. Three separate interrogations took place between 1939 and 1943 with the last in Berlin. No word of the Polish Bombe or Bletchley Park was ever leaked. This became known as \"Case Wicher\" and they convinced themselves that the Enigma indicator system was probably at fault. It was followed up by OKW but testing never recovered any weaknesses.\nBULLET::::- In early 1944, mounting losses at Nazi Germany's \"Kriegsmarine\", resulted in a navy cryptanalyst Frotiwein, being ordered to test the four rotor navy Enigma. He broke the machine with known wheels on a crib of 25 letters. The evidence was not strong enough to discontinue the use of the device. OKW/Chi helped conduct the test using their own machine and soon afterwards started development of the variable-notch rotor (German: Lueckenfuellerwalz).\nBULLET::::- After the War, interrogations by TICOM of Dr H\u00fcttenhain revealed the following:\nGerman military cryptographers failed to realize that their Enigma, T52 and other systems were insecure. Although many attempts were made to try and validate the security of the Enigma, which the whole of the Wehrmacht secure communication cryptographic infrastructure rested on, they failed. The reason for this, was they were unable to conduct sufficiently deep security tests to determine how secure they were. They were also unable to put forth the costly practical effort required to solve them. Their security tests were theoretical only, and they were unable to imagine what a large concerted effort at traffic analysis could achieve. A security measure which would have proved productive, was the issue of new Enigma rotors. However, so many Enigma machines were out in the field, that it would prove impractical to update them. OKW/Chi also felt that even if a particular Enigma unit was captured, it would still be considered secure, since no process was known by OKW/Chi that could break it. They also had not advanced sufficiently in cryptology to realize what could be achieved by a large combined engineering team. The Allies had undertaken that effort and had been reward with huge successes Also Germany was unable to cryptanalyze British and American high-grade systems (Ultra) carrying critical Allied data. As a result, OKW/Chi had no hint that their own high-grade systems were insecure."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-9256": 3, "wikipedia-872175": 3, "wikipedia-53157079": 1, "wikipedia-1294236": 3, "wikipedia-25382408": 1, "wikipedia-3155420": 3, "wikipedia-41568237": 2, "wikipedia-2774229": 2, "wikipedia-2823375": 1, "wikipedia-41568902": 2}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-9256": 3, "wikipedia-872175": 3, "wikipedia-53157079": 2, "wikipedia-1294236": 3, "wikipedia-25382408": 1, "wikipedia-3155420": 3, "wikipedia-41568237": 3, "wikipedia-2774229": 3, "wikipedia-2823375": 1, "wikipedia-41568902": 3}}}

For example, the pin corresponding to the letter \"E\" might be wired to the contact for letter \"T\" on the opposite face, and so on. Enigma's security came from using several rotors in series (usually three or four) and the regular stepping movement of the rotors, thus implementing a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.\nTo avoid merely implementing a simple (and easily solvable) substitution cipher, every key press caused one or more rotors to step by one twenty-sixth of a full rotation, before the electrical connections were made. This changed the substitution alphabet used for encryption, ensuring that the cryptographic substitution was different at each new rotor position, producing a more formidable polyalphabetic substitution cipher.\nWith the exception of models \"A\" and \"B\", the last rotor came before a 'reflector' (German: \"Umkehrwalze\", meaning 'reversal rotor'), a patented feature unique to Enigma among the period's various rotor machines. The reflector connected outputs of the last rotor in pairs, redirecting current back through the rotors by a different route. The reflector ensured that Enigma would be self-reciprocal; thus, with two identically configured machines, a message could be encrypted on one and decrypted on the other. The reflector also gave Enigma the property that no letter ever encrypted to itself. This was a severe conceptual flaw and a cryptological mistake subsequently exploited by codebreakers."], "wikipedia-520066": ["In the early 20th century, the invention of complex mechanical and electromechanical machines, such as the Enigma rotor machine, provided more sophisticated and efficient means of encryption; and the subsequent introduction of electronics and computing has allowed elaborate schemes of still greater complexity, most of which are entirely unsuited to pen and paper."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II, in all branches of the German military. \nEnigma has an electromechanical rotor mechanism that scrambles the 26 letters of the alphabet. In typical use, one person enters text on the Enigma\u2019s keyboard and another person writes down which of 26 lights above the keyboard lights up at each key press. If plain text is entered, the lit-up letters are the encoded ciphertext. Entering ciphertext transforms it back into readable plaintext. The rotor mechanism changes the electrical connections between the keys and the lights with each keypress. The security of the system depends on Enigma machine settings that were changed daily, based on secret key lists distributed in advance, and on other settings that change for each message. The receiving station has to know and use the exact settings employed by the transmitting station to successfully decrypt a message.\n\nLike other rotor machines, the Enigma machine is a combination of mechanical and electrical subsystems. The mechanical subsystem consists of a keyboard; a set of rotating disks called \"rotors\" arranged adjacently along a spindle; one of various stepping components to turn at least one rotor with each key press, and a series of lamps, one for each letter.\n\nThe repeated changes of electrical path through an Enigma scrambler implemented a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that provided Enigma's security. The diagram on the right shows how the electrical pathway changed with each key depression, which caused rotation of at least the right-hand rotor. Current passed into the set of rotors, into and back out of the reflector, and out through the rotors again. The greyed-out lines are other possible paths within each rotor; these are hard-wired from one side of each rotor to the other. The letter \"A\" encrypts differently with consecutive key presses, first to \"G\", and then to \"C\". This is because the right-hand rotor has stepped, sending the signal on a completely different route. Eventually other rotors step with a key press.\n\nThe rotors (alternatively \"wheels\" or \"drums\", \"Walzen\" in German) formed the heart of an Enigma machine. Each rotor was a disc approximately in diameter made from Ebonite or Bakelite with 26 brass, spring-loaded, electrical contact pins arranged in a circle on one face; the other side housing the corresponding number of circular plates electrical contacts. The pins and contacts represent the alphabet\u00a0\u2014 typically the 26 letters A\u2013Z, as will be assumed for the rest of this description. When the rotors were mounted side-by-side on the spindle, the pins of one rotor rested against the plate contacts of the neighbouring rotor, forming an electrical connection. Inside the body of the rotor, 26 wires connected each pin on one side to a contact on the other in a complex pattern."], "wikipedia-3152941": ["In cryptography, the clock was a method devised by Polish mathematician-cryptologist Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki, at the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau, to facilitate decrypting German Enigma ciphers. The method determined the rightmost rotor in the German Enigma by exploiting the different turnover positions. For the Poles, learning the rightmost rotor reduced the rotor-order search space by a factor of 3 (the number of rotors). The British improved the method, and it allowed them to use their limited number of bombes more effectively (the British confronted 5 to 8 rotors).\n\nThe Enigma cipher machine relied on the users having some shared secrets. Here are the secret daily settings from a 1930 Enigma manual:\nThe daily settings told the code clerks how to configure the machine so message could be exchanged. Initially, the machine had three rotors that could be arranged in any order (the wheel order or rotor order). Each rotor had a ring with numbers or letters on it, and that ring could be in any of 26 positions. A plugboard interchanged additional characters.\n\nFor each message, the operator would choose a three-letter message key to encrypt the body of the message. The intention was for this key to be random, and using a random key for each message was a good security practice. The message key needed to be communicated to the recipient so the recipient could decrypt the message.\n\nThe clock method exploited the three rotors (I, II, III) having different turnover positions. The rightmost rotor moved as each character was enciphered. At a certain position on the ring, enciphering the character would also cause the next rotor to the left to move one position (a turnover). The ring position that caused the next rotor to move was different for each rotor: rotor I advanced at the Q-R transition (\"royal\"); rotor II advanced at E-F (\"flags\"); rotor III advanced at V-W (\"wave\"). If the turnover could be detected, then the rightmost rotor might be identified."], "wikipedia-1294236": ["Understanding the way the machine encrypts requires taking into account the current position of each rotor, the ring setting and its internal wiring.\nSection::::Rotor electrical view.\nSince the same wires are used for forwards and backwards legs, a major cryptographic weakness is that no letter can map to itself.\nSection::::Rotor offset.\nThe effect of rotation on the rotors can be demonstrated with some examples.\nAs an example, let us take rotor type I of Enigma I (see table below) without any ring setting offset. It can be seen that an is encoded as an , a encoded as a , and a is encoded as an . Notice that every letter is encoded into another.\nIn the case of the reflectors, in this example Wide B is taken (Reflector B in the table below) where an A is returned as a Y and the Y is returned as an A. Notice that the wirings are connected as a loop between two letters.\nWhen a rotor has stepped, the offset must be taken into account to know what the output is, and where it enters the next rotor.\nIf for example rotor I is in the B-position, an A enters at the letter B which is wired to the K. Because of the offset this K enters the next rotor in the J position.\nWith the rotors I, II and III (from left to right), wide B-reflector, all ring settings in A-position, and start position AAA, typing AAAAA will produce the encoded sequence BDZGO.\nSection::::Ring setting.\nThe ring settings, or \"Ringstellung\", are used to change the position of the internal wiring relative to the rotor. They do not change the notch or the alphabet ring on the exterior. Those are fixed to the rotor. Changing the ring setting will therefore change the positions of the wiring, relative to the turnover-point and start position.\nThe ring setting will rotate the wiring. Where rotor I in the A-position normally encodes an A into an E, with a ring setting offset B-02 it will be encoded into K\nAs mentioned before these encodings only happen after the key is pressed and the rotor has turned. Tracing the signal on the rotors AAA is therefore only possible if a key is pressed while the rotors were in the position AAZ.\nWith the rotors I, II, III (from left to right), wide B-reflector, all ring settings in B-position, and start position AAA, typing AAAAA will produce the encoded sequence EWTYX.\nSection::::Rotor wiring tables.\nThis table shows how the internal wiring connects the right side of the rotor (with the spring-loaded contacts) to the left side. Each rotor is a simple substitution cipher. The letters are listed as connected to alphabet order. If the first letter of a rotor is E, this means that the A is wired to the E. This does not mean that E is wired to A. This looped wiring is only the case with the reflectors."], "wikipedia-520066": ["In the early 20th century, the invention of complex mechanical and electromechanical machines, such as the Enigma rotor machine, provided more sophisticated and efficient means of encryption; and the subsequent introduction of electronics and computing has allowed elaborate schemes of still greater complexity, most of which are entirely unsuited to pen and paper."], "wikipedia-2774229": ["The German Enigma message procedures at the time used common but secret daily machine settings, but the procedures also had each code clerk choose a three-letter message key. For example, a clerk might choose \"ABL\" as the message key. The message key was used to set the initial position of the rotors when encrypting (or decrypting) the body of the message. Choosing a different message key was a security measure: it avoided having all the day's messages sent using the same polyalphabetic key which would have made the messages vulnerable to a polyalphabetic attack. However, the sender needed to communicate the message key to the recipient in order for the recipient to decrypt the message. The message key was first encrypted using the day's \"Grundstellung\" (a secret initial position of the Enigma's rotors, e.g., \"FOL\").\n\nCommunications were sometimes garbled, and if the message key were garbled, then the recipient would not be able to decrypt the message. Consequently, the Germans took the precaution of sending the message key twice; if there was a garble, the recipient should be able to find the message key. Here, the Germans committed a crucial error. Instead of sending the encrypted message key (e.g., \"PKP\") twice to get \"PKP PKP\", the Germans doubled the message key (e.g., \"ABL ABL\"), encrypted the doubled key to get (\"PKP JXI\"), and sent the encrypted doubled key. That mistake allowed Rejewski to identify six sequential permutations of the Enigma and exploit the knowledge they encrypted the same message key.\n\nWith the help of a commercial Enigma machine, some German materials obtained by French spy Hans Thilo-Schmidt, and German cipher clerks who would choose weak keys, Rejewki was able to reverse engineer the wiring of the Enigma's rotors and reflector. The Polish Cipher Bureau then built several Polish Enigma doubles that could be used to decipher German messages."], "wikipedia-3155420": ["The Enigma rotor cipher machine changes plaintext characters into cipher text using a different permutation for each character, and so implements a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.\n\nThe Enigma I used by the German military in the 1930s was a 3-rotor machine. Initially, there were only three rotors labeled \"I\", \"II\", and \"III\", but they could be arranged in any order when placed in the machine. Rejewski identified the rotor permutations by , , and ; the encipherment produced by the rotors altered as each character was encrypted. The rightmost permutation () changed with each character. In addition, there was a plugboard that did some additional scrambling.\n\nTo encrypt or decrypt, the operator made the following machine key settings:\nBULLET::::- the rotor order (\"Walzenlage\")\nBULLET::::- the ring settings (\"Ringstellung\")\nBULLET::::- the plugboard connections (\"Steckerverbindung\")\nBULLET::::- an initial rotor position (\"Grundstellung\")\n\nIn the early 1930s, the Germans distributed a secret monthly list of all the daily machine settings. The Germans knew that it would be foolish to encrypt the day's traffic using the same key, so each message had its own \"message key\". This message key was the sender-chosen initial rotor positions (e.g., YEK). The message key had to be conveyed to the recipient operator, so the Germans decided to encrypt it using the day's pre-specified daily ground setting (\"Grundstellung\"). The recipient would use the daily machine settings for all messages. He would set the Enigma's initial rotor position to the ground setting and decrypt the message key. The recipient would then set the initial rotor position to the message key and decrypt the body of the message.\n\nThe Enigma was used with radio communications, so letters were occasionally corrupted during transmission or reception. If the recipient did not have the correct message key, then the recipient could not decipher the message. The Germans decided to send the three-letter message key twice to guard against transmission errors. Instead of encrypting the message key \"YEK\" once and sending the encrypted key twice, the Germans doubled the message key to \"YEKYEK\" (\"doubled key\"), encrypted the doubled key with the ground setting, and sent the encrypted doubled key. The recipient could then recognize a garbled message key and still decrypt the message. For example, if the recipient received and decrypted the doubled key as \"YEKYEN\", then the recipient could try both message keys \"YEK\" and \"YEN\"; one would produce the desired message and the other would produce gibberish."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-9256": 3, "wikipedia-3152941": 1, "wikipedia-1294236": 1, "wikipedia-466203": 1, "wikipedia-1530481": 1, "wikipedia-520066": 3, "wikipedia-2774229": 1, "wikipedia-175115": 1, "wikipedia-3155420": 1, "wikipedia-578022": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-9256": 3, "wikipedia-3152941": 2, "wikipedia-1294236": 2, "wikipedia-466203": 1, "wikipedia-1530481": 1, "wikipedia-520066": 3, "wikipedia-2774229": 2, "wikipedia-175115": 1, "wikipedia-3155420": 2, "wikipedia-578022": 1}}}

The mechanical subsystem consists of a keyboard; a set of rotating disks called \"rotors\" arranged adjacently along a spindle; one of various stepping components to turn at least one rotor with each key press, and a series of lamps, one for each letter.\n\nThe mechanical parts act in such a way as to form a varying electrical circuit. When a key is pressed, one or more rotors rotate on the spindle. On the sides of the rotors are a series of electrical contacts that, after rotation, line up with contacts on the other rotors or fixed wiring on either end of the spindle. When the rotors are properly aligned, each key on the keyboard is connected to a unique electrical pathway through the series of contacts and internal wiring. Current, typically from a battery, flows through the pressed key, into the newly configured set of circuits and back out again, ultimately lighting one display lamp, which shows the output letter. For example, when encrypting a message starting \"ANX...\", the operator would first press the \"A\" key, and the \"Z\" lamp might light, so \"Z\" would be the first letter of the ciphertext. The operator would next press \"N\", and then \"X\" in the same fashion, and so on.\n\nCurrent flowed from the battery (1) through a depressed bi-directional keyboard switch (2) to the plugboard (3). Next, it passed through the (unused in this instance, so shown closed) plug \"A\" (3) via the entry wheel (4), through the wiring of the three (Wehrmacht Enigma) or four (\"Kriegsmarine\" M4 and \"Abwehr\" variants) installed rotors (5), and entered the reflector (6). The reflector returned the current, via an entirely different path, back through the rotors (5) and entry wheel (4), proceeding through plug \"S\" (7) connected with a cable (8) to plug \"D\", and another bi-directional switch (9) to light the appropriate lamp.\n\nThe repeated changes of electrical path through an Enigma scrambler implemented a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that provided Enigma's security. The diagram on the right shows how the electrical pathway changed with each key depression, which caused rotation of at least the right-hand rotor. Current passed into the set of rotors, into and back out of the reflector, and out through the rotors again. The greyed-out lines are other possible paths within each rotor; these are hard-wired from one side of each rotor to the other. The letter \"A\" encrypts differently with consecutive key presses, first to \"G\", and then to \"C\". This is because the right-hand rotor has stepped, sending the signal on a completely different route. Eventually other rotors step with a key press.\n\nThe rotors (alternatively \"wheels\" or \"drums\", \"Walzen\" in German) formed the heart of an Enigma machine. Each rotor was a disc approximately in diameter made from Ebonite or Bakelite with 26 brass, spring-loaded, electrical contact pins arranged in a circle on one face; the other side housing the corresponding number of circular plates electrical contacts. The pins and contacts represent the alphabet \u2014 typically the 26 letters A\u2013Z, as will be assumed for the rest of this description. When the rotors were mounted side-by-side on the spindle, the pins of one rotor rested against the plate contacts of the neighbouring rotor, forming an electrical connection. Inside the body of the rotor, 26 wires connected each pin on one side to a contact on the other in a complex pattern."], "wikipedia-3155420": ["The Enigma rotor cipher machine changes plaintext characters into cipher text using a different permutation for each character, and so implements a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.\nThe Enigma I used by the German military in the 1930s was a 3-rotor machine.

It had a keyboard, like the ones used on a typewriter, containing all the letters of the alphabet. Each of the 26 letters was connected electrically to one of three rotors, each provided with a ring. Each ring also held the 26 letters of the alphabet. Further electrical connections led from the rotors to 26 illuminated letters.\n\nWhen an operator, enciphering a message, pressed a key, an electric current passed through the machine and the rotors turned mechanically, but not in unison. Every time a key was pushed, the first rotor would rotate one letter. This happened 26 times until the first rotor had made a complete revolution. Then the second rotor would start to rotate. And so on.\n\nWhen a key was pressed, a light came on behind the cipher text letter, always different from the original letter in the plain text. The illuminated letters made up the coded message.\n\nThe system worked in reverse. The person decoding a cipher message would use an Enigma with identical settings. When he pressed the cipher text letter, the letter in the original plain text message lit up.

Also, the rings on the rotors could be put in a different order each day \u2013 for example, on one day the first rotor could be set at B, the next day at F, and so on.\n\nThe military version of Enigma was provided with a plug board, like an old telephone switchboard. This allowed an extra switching of the letters, both before they entered the rotors and after leaving them. The plug board had 26 holes. Connections were made with wires and plugs. With three rotors and, say, six pairs of letters connected with the plug board, there would be 105,456 different combinations of the alphabet.\n\nIn December 1938 the Germans added additional rotors (up to six) and the number of combinations increased dramatically."], "wikipedia-615354": ["The Enigma is an electro-mechanical rotor machine used for the encryption and decryption of secret messages. It was developed in Germany in the 1920s. The repeated changes of the electrical pathway from the keyboard to the lampboard implement a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which turns plaintext into ciphertext and back again. The Enigma's scrambler contains rotors with 26 electrical contacts on each side, whose wiring diverts the current to a different position on the two sides. On depressing a key on the keyboard, an electric current flows through an entry drum at the right-hand end of the scrambler, then through the set of rotors to a reflecting drum (or reflector) which turns it back through the rotors and entry drum, and out to cause one lamp on the lampboard to be illuminated.\nAt each key depression, the right-hand or \"fast\" rotor advances one position, which causes the encipherment to change. In addition, at a certain point, the right-hand rotor causes the middle rotor to advance; in a similar way, the middle rotor might cause the left-hand (or \"slow\") rotor to advance. Each rotor causes the \"turnover\" of the rotor to its left after a full rotation. The Enigma operator could rotate the wheels by hand to change the letter of the alphabet showing through a window, to set the start position of the rotors for enciphering a message. This three-letter sequence is the \"message key\". There are 26 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 26 17,576 possible positions of the set of three rotors, and hence different message keys. By opening the lid of the machine and releasing a compression bar, the set of three rotors on their spindle could be removed from the machine and their sequence (called the \"wheel order\" at Bletchley Park) could be altered. Multiplying 17,576 by the six possible wheel orders gives 105,456 different ways that the scrambler could be set up.\nIn 1930, the German army introduced an additional security feature, a plugboard (\"Steckerbrett\" in German; each plug is a \"Stecker\") that further scrambled the letters. The Enigma encryption is a self inverse, it swapped letters in pairs: if codice_2 is transformed into codice_3 then codice_3 is transformed into codice_2. The plugboard maintained the self inverse, but the plugboard transformation, unlike the rotor transformation, does not change during the encryption. This regularity was exploited by Welchman's \"diagonal board\" enhancement to the bombe, which vastly increased its efficiency.

They do not change the notch or the alphabet ring on the exterior. Those are fixed to the rotor. Changing the ring setting will therefore change the positions of the wiring, relative to the turnover-point and start position.\nThe ring setting will rotate the wiring.

By opening the lid of the machine and releasing a compression bar, the set of three rotors on their spindle could be removed from the machine and their sequence (called the \"wheel order\" at Bletchley Park) could be altered. Multiplying 17,576 by the six possible wheel orders gives 105,456 different ways that the scrambler could be set up.\nIn 1930, the German army introduced an additional security feature, a plugboard (\"Steckerbrett\" in German; each plug is a \"Stecker\") that further scrambled the letters. The Enigma encryption is a self inverse, it swapped letters in pairs: if codice_2 is transformed into codice_3 then codice_3 is transformed into codice_2. The plugboard maintained the self inverse, but the plugboard transformation, unlike the rotor transformation, does not change during the encryption. This regularity was exploited by Welchman's \"diagonal board\" enhancement to the bombe, which vastly increased its efficiency. With six plug leads in use (leaving 14 letters \"unsteckered\") this gives 100,391,791,500 possible ways of setting up the plugboard.\nAn important feature of the machine from a cryptanalyst's point of view, and indeed Enigma's Achilles' heel, was that the reflector in the scrambler meant that a letter was never enciphered as itself. Any putative solution that gave, for any location, the same letter in the proposed plaintext and the ciphertext could therefore be eliminated."], "wikipedia-2774229": ["The German Enigma message procedures at the time used common but secret daily machine settings, but the procedures also had each code clerk choose a three-letter message key.

Choosing a different message key was a security measure: it avoided having all the day's messages sent using the same polyalphabetic key which would have made the messages vulnerable to a polyalphabetic attack. However, the sender needed to communicate the message key to the recipient in order for the recipient to decrypt the message. The message key was first encrypted using the day's \"Grundstellung\" (a secret initial position of the Enigma's rotors, e.g., \"FOL\").\n\nCommunications were sometimes garbled, and if the message key were garbled, then the recipient would not be able to decrypt the message. Consequently, the Germans took the precaution of sending the message key twice; if there was a garble, the recipient should be able to find the message key. Here, the Germans committed a crucial error. Instead of sending the encrypted message key (e.g., \"PKP\") twice to get \"PKP PKP\", the Germans doubled the message key (e.g., \"ABL ABL\"), encrypted the doubled key to get (\"PKP JXI\"), and sent the encrypted doubled key.

The Enigma's scrambler contains rotors with 26 electrical contacts on each side, whose wiring diverts the current to a different position on the two sides. On depressing a key on the keyboard, an electric current flows through an entry drum at the right-hand end of the scrambler, then through the set of rotors to a reflecting drum (or reflector) which turns it back through the rotors and entry drum, and out to cause one lamp on the lampboard to be illuminated.\n\nAt each key depression, the right-hand or \"fast\" rotor advances one position, which causes the encipherment to change.

In typical use, one person enters text on the Enigma\u2019s keyboard and another person writes down which of 26 lights above the keyboard lights up at each key press. If plain text is entered, the lit-up letters are the encoded ciphertext. Entering ciphertext transforms it back into readable plaintext. The rotor mechanism changes the electrical connections between the keys and the lights with each keypress. The security of the system depends on Enigma machine settings that were changed daily, based on secret key lists distributed in advance, and on other settings that change for each message. The receiving station has to know and use the exact settings employed by the transmitting station to successfully decrypt a message.\nLike other rotor machines, the Enigma machine is a combination of mechanical and electrical subsystems. The mechanical subsystem consists of a keyboard; a set of rotating disks called \"rotors\" arranged adjacently along a spindle; one of various stepping components to turn at least one rotor with each key press, and a series of lamps, one for each letter.\nThe mechanical parts act in such a way as to form a varying electrical circuit. When a key is pressed, one or more rotors rotate on the spindle. On the sides of the rotors are a series of electrical contacts that, after rotation, line up with contacts on the other rotors or fixed wiring on either end of the spindle. When the rotors are properly aligned, each key on the keyboard is connected to a unique electrical pathway through the series of contacts and internal wiring. Current, typically from a battery, flows through the pressed key, into the newly configured set of circuits and back out again, ultimately lighting one display lamp, which shows the output letter.

The Enigma I used by the German military in the 1930s was a 3-rotor machine. Initially, there were only three rotors labeled \"I\", \"II\", and \"III\", but they could be arranged in any order when placed in the machine. Rejewski identified the rotor permutations by , , and ; the encipherment produced by the rotors altered as each character was encrypted. The rightmost permutation () changed with each character. In addition, there was a plugboard that did some additional scrambling.\n\nTo encrypt or decrypt, the operator made the following machine key settings:\nBULLET::::- the rotor order (\"Walzenlage\")\nBULLET::::- the ring settings (\"Ringstellung\")\nBULLET::::- the plugboard connections (\"Steckerverbindung\")\nBULLET::::- an initial rotor position (\"Grundstellung\")\n\nIn the early 1930s, the Germans distributed a secret monthly list of all the daily machine settings. The Germans knew that it would be foolish to encrypt the day's traffic using the same key, so each message had its own \"message key\". This message key was the sender-chosen initial rotor positions (e.g., YEK). The message key had to be conveyed to the recipient operator, so the Germans decided to encrypt it using the day's pre-specified daily ground setting (\"Grundstellung\"). The recipient would use the daily machine settings for all messages. He would set the Enigma's initial rotor position to the ground setting and decrypt the message key. The recipient would then set the initial rotor position to the message key and decrypt the body of the message.\n\nThe Enigma was used with radio communications, so letters were occasionally corrupted during transmission or reception. If the recipient did not have the correct message key, then the recipient could not decipher the message. The Germans decided to send the three-letter message key twice to guard against transmission errors. Instead of encrypting the message key \"YEK\" once and sending the encrypted key twice, the Germans doubled the message key to \"YEKYEK\" (\"doubled key\"), encrypted the doubled key with the ground setting, and sent the encrypted doubled key. The recipient could then recognize a garbled message key and still decrypt the message. For example, if the recipient received and decrypted the doubled key as \"YEKYEN\", then the recipient could try both message keys \"YEK\" and \"YEN\"; one would produce the desired message and the other would produce gibberish.\n\nThe encrypted doubled key was a huge cryptographic mistake because it allowed cryptanalysts to know two encipherments of the same letter, three places apart, for each of the three letters. The Polish codebreakers exploited this mistake in many ways.

While Germany introduced a series of improvements to Enigma, and these hampered decryption efforts to varying degrees, they did not ultimately prevent Britain and its allies from exploiting Enigma-encoded messages as a major source of intelligence during the war. Many commentators say this flow of communications intelligence shortened the war significantly and may even have altered its outcome.\n\nAround December 1932, Marian Rejewski, a Polish mathematician and cryptanalyst, while working at the Polish Cipher Bureau, used the theory of permutations and flaws in the German military message encipherment procedures to break the message keys of the plugboard Enigma machine. Rejewski achieved this result without knowledge of the wiring of the machine, so the result did not allow the Poles to decrypt actual messages. The French spy Hans-Thilo Schmidt obtained access to German cipher materials that included the daily keys used in September and October 1932. Those keys included the plugboard settings. The French passed the material to the Poles, and Rejewski used some of that material and the message traffic in September and October to solve for the unknown rotor wiring. Consequently, the Polish mathematicians were able to build their own Enigma machines, which were called Enigma doubles. Rejewski was aided by cryptanalysts Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki and Henryk Zygalski, both of whom had been recruited with Rejewski from Pozna\u0144 University. The Polish Cipher Bureau developed techniques to defeat the plugboard and find all components of the daily key, which enabled the Cipher Bureau to read the German Enigma messages starting from January 1933. Over time, the German cryptographic procedures improved, and the Cipher Bureau developed techniques and designed mechanical devices to continue reading the Enigma traffic. As part of that effort, the Poles exploited quirks of the rotors, compiled catalogues, built a cyclometer to help make a catalogue with 100,000 entries, made Zygalski sheets and built the electro-mechanical cryptologic bomb to search for rotor settings. In 1938, the Germans added complexity to the Enigma machines that finally became too expensive for the Poles to counter. The Poles had six \"bomby\", but when the Germans added two more rotors, ten times as many \"bomby\" were needed, and the Poles did not have the resources.\n\nOn 26 and 27 July 1939, in Pyry near Warsaw, the Poles initiated French and British military intelligence representatives into their Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment, including Zygalski sheets and the cryptologic bomb, and promised each delegation a Polish-reconstructed Enigma. The demonstration represented a vital basis for the later British continuation and effort. During the war, British cryptologists decrypted a vast number of messages enciphered on Enigma. The intelligence gleaned from this source, codenamed \"Ultra\" by the British, was a substantial aid to the Allied war effort.\n\nThough Enigma had some cryptographic weaknesses, in practice it was German procedural flaws, operator mistakes, failure to systematically introduce changes in encipherment procedures, and Allied capture of key tables and hardware that, during the war, enabled Allied cryptologists to succeed and \"turned the tide\" in the Allies' favour."], "wikipedia-889043": ["Probably the most important codebreaking event of the war was the successful decryption by the Allies of the German \"Enigma\" Cipher.

The top panel is quite weathered and shows rows of horsemen. The second panel depicts armed foot soldiers and the third panel shows the decapitated vanquished soldiers, the heads piled up, and soldiers, archers and horsemen surrounding what may be a broch. The base panel depicts the victorious army leaving the battlefield. The sides are also elaborately carved. In the early 1990s the stone was encased in armoured glass to prevent further erosion and also graffiti. One hypothesis is that the figures depicted in the battle, parade and decapitation scenes is the army of Kenneth MacAlpin (Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn), the scene being the representation of Kenneth's demonstration of his military and legal authority over northern Pictland. The traditional interpretation of the battle scene was that it shows a victory by Malcolm II (M\u00e1el Coluim mac Cin\u00e1eda) (reigned 1005\u20131034) against Danes or Norse led by one Sueno. This appears in Alexander Gordon's \"Itinerarium Septentrionale\" of 1726 and is thought to have been ancient then, derived from folklore and the more learned histories of John of Fordun, Hector Boece and George Buchanan. However, this interpretation is no longer supported by historians and archaeologists. Several more recent interpretations have been advanced. Anthony Jackson suggested that the stone displayed the final triumph of the Christian Gaels of D\u00e1l Riata over their, supposedly , Pictish enemies, in which case it would have been erected by Kenneth MacAlpin or his immediate successors. As an alternative, Archie Duncan advances his theory that the stone records the defeat, death and reburial of Dub (Dub mac Ma\u00edl Coluim) in 966 or 967. A modified form of Jackson's theory, stripped of much of the ingenious interpretation, is probably the present orthodoxy. This holds that Sueno's Stone commemorates an unknown victory by the \"men of Alba\", the Gaelicised Picts of the lands south of the Mounth over the \"men of Moray\", those of the lands north of the Mounth."], "wikipedia-740705": ["BULLET::::- The Englishmen in the play are a detachment of the Royal Engineers and function as part of the Ordnance Survey creating six inch maps of Ireland.

The switchboard was an essential component of a manual telephone exchange, and was operated by switchboard operators who used electrical cords or switches to establish the connections.\nThe electromechanical automatic telephone exchange, invented by Almon Strowger in 1888, gradually replaced manual switchboards in central telephone exchanges around the world. In 1919, the Bell System in Canada also adopted automatic switching as its future technology, after years of reliance on manual systems.\nNevertheless, many manual branch exchanges remained operational into the second half of the 20th century in many enterprises. Later electronic devices and computer technology gave the operator access to an abundance of features. A private branch exchange (PBX) in a business usually has an attendant console for the operator, or an auto-attendant, which bypasses the operator entirely.\nFollowing the invention of the telephone in 1876, the first telephones were rented in pairs which were limited to conversation between the parties operating those two instruments. The use of a central exchange was soon found to be even more advantageous than in telegraphy. In January 1878 the Boston Telephone Dispatch company had started hiring boys as telephone operators. Boys had been very successful as telegraphy operators, but their attitude, lack of patience, and behavior was unacceptable for live telephone contact, so the company began hiring women operators instead. Thus, on September 1, 1878, Boston Telephone Dispatch hired Emma Nutt as the first woman operator. Small towns typically had the switchboard installed in the operator's home so that he or she could answer calls on a 24-hour basis. In 1894, New England Telephone and Telegraph Company installed the first battery-operated switchboard on January 9 in Lexington, Massachusetts.\nEarly switchboards in large cities usually were mounted floor to ceiling in order to allow the operators to reach all the lines in the exchange. The operators were boys who would use a ladder to connect to the higher jacks. Late in the 1890s this measure failed to keep up with the increasing number of lines, and Milo G. Kellogg devised the Divided Multiple Switchboard for operators to work together, with a team on the \"A board\" and another on the \"B\". These operators were almost always women until the early 1970s, when men were once again hired. Cord switchboards were often referred to as \"cordboards\" by telephone company personnel. Conversion to Panel switch and other automated switching systems first eliminated the \"B\" operator and then, usually years later, the \"A\". Rural and suburban switchboards for the most part remained small and simple. In many cases, customers came to know their operator by name.\nAs telephone exchanges converted to automatic (dial) service, switchboards continued to serve specialized purposes. Before the advent of direct-dialed long distance calls, a subscriber would need to contact the long-distance operator in order to place a toll call. In large cities, there was often a special number, such as 112, which would ring the long-distance operator directly. Elsewhere, the subscriber would ask the local operator to ring the long-distance operator.\nThe long distance operator would record the name and city of the person to be called, and the operator would advise the calling party to hang up and wait for the call to be completed. Each toll center had only a limited number of trunks to distant cities, and if those circuits were busy, the operator would try alternate routings through intermediate cities. The operator would plug into a trunk for the destination city, and the inward operator would answer. The inward operator would obtain the number from the local information operator, and ring the call. Once the called party answered, the originating operator would advise him or her to stand by for the calling party, whom she'd then ring back, and record the starting time, once the conversation began.\nIn the 1940s, with the advent of dial pulse and multi-frequency operator dialing, the operator would plug into a tandem trunk and dial the NPA (area code) and operator code for the information operator in the distant city. For instance, the New York City information operator was 212-131. If the customer knew the number, and the point was direct-dialable, the operator would dial the call. If the distant city did not have dialable numbers, the operator would dial the code for the inward operator serving the called party, and ask her to ring the number.\nIn the 1960s, once most phone subscribers had direct long-distance dialing, a single type of operator began to serve both the local and long distance functions. A customer might call to request a collect call, a call billed to a third number, or a person-to-person call. All toll calls from coin phones required operator assistance. The operator was also available to help complete a local or long-distance number which did not complete. For example, if a customer encountered a reorder tone (a fast busy signal), it could indicate \"all circuits busy,\" or a problem in the destination exchange. The operator might be able to use a different routing to complete the call. If the operator could not get through by dialing the number, she could call the inward operator in the destination city, and ask her to try the number, or to test a line to see if it was busy or out of order.\nCord switchboards used for these purposes were replaced in the 1970s and 1980s by TSPS and similar systems, which greatly reduced operator involvement in calls. The customer would, instead of simply dialing \"0\" for the operator, dial 0+NPA+7digits, after which an operator would answer and provide the desired service (coin collection, obtaining acceptance on a collect call, etc.), and then release the call to be automatically handled by the TSPS.\nBefore the late 1970s and early 1980s, it was common for many smaller cities to have their own operators. An NPA (area code) would usually have its largest city as its primary toll center, with smaller toll centers serving the secondary cities scattered throughout the NPA. TSPS allowed telephone companies to close smaller toll centers and consolidate operator services in regional centers which might be hundreds of miles from the subscriber."], "wikipedia-12148146": ["Kellogg Switchboard & Supply Company was an American manufacturer of telecommunication equipment.

Since the advent of Internet telephony (Voice over IP) technologies, PBX development has tended toward the IP PBX, which uses the Internet Protocol to carry calls. Most modern PBXs support VoIP. ISDN PBX systems also replaced some traditional PBXs in the 1990s, as ISDN offers features such as conference calling, call forwarding, and programmable caller ID.

POTS remains the basic form of residential and small business service connection to the telephone network in many parts of the world. The term reflects the technology that has been available since the introduction of the public telephone system in the late 19th century, in a form mostly unchanged despite the introduction of Touch-Tone dialing, electronic telephone exchanges and fiber-optic communication into the public switched telephone network (PSTN).\n\nThe communication circuits of the public switched telephone network continue to be modernized by advances in digital communications; however, other than improving sound quality, these changes have been mainly transparent to customers.

Elsewhere, the subscriber would ask the local operator to ring the long-distance operator.\n\nThe long distance operator would record the name and city of the person to be called, and the operator would advise the calling party to hang up and wait for the call to be completed. Each toll center had only a limited number of trunks to distant cities, and if those circuits were busy, the operator would try alternate routings through intermediate cities. The operator would plug into a trunk for the destination city, and the inward operator would answer. The inward operator would obtain the number from the local information operator, and ring the call. Once the called party answered, the originating operator would advise him or her to stand by for the calling party, whom she'd then ring back, and record the starting time, once the conversation began.\n\nIn the 1940s, with the advent of dial pulse and multi-frequency operator dialing, the operator would plug into a tandem trunk and dial the NPA (area code) and operator code for the information operator in the distant city. For instance, the New York City information operator was 212-131. If the customer knew the number, and the point was direct-dialable, the operator would dial the call. If the distant city did not have dialable numbers, the operator would dial the code for the inward operator serving the called party, and ask her to ring the number.\n\nIn the 1960s, once most phone subscribers had direct long-distance dialing, a single type of operator began to serve both the local and long distance functions. A customer might call to request a collect call, a call billed to a third number, or a person-to-person call. All toll calls from coin phones required operator assistance. The operator was also available to help complete a local or long-distance number which did not complete. For example, if a customer encountered a reorder tone (a fast busy signal), it could indicate \"all circuits busy,\" or a problem in the destination exchange. The operator might be able to use a different routing to complete the call. If the operator could not get through by dialing the number, she could call the inward operator in the destination city, and ask her to try the number, or to test a line to see if it was busy or out of order.\n\nCord switchboards used for these purposes were replaced in the 1970s and 1980s by TSPS and similar systems, which greatly reduced operator involvement in calls. The customer would, instead of simply dialing \"0\" for the operator, dial 0+NPA+7digits, after which an operator would answer and provide the desired service (coin collection, obtaining acceptance on a collect call, etc.), and then release the call to be automatically handled by the TSPS.\n\nBefore the late 1970s and early 1980s, it was common for many smaller cities to have their own operators. An NPA (area code) would usually have its largest city as its primary toll center, with smaller toll centers serving the secondary cities scattered throughout the NPA. TSPS allowed telephone companies to close smaller toll centers and consolidate operator services in regional centers which might be hundreds of miles from the subscriber."], "wikipedia-12148146": ["Kellogg himself held more than 150 patents, and had invented the divided multiple telephone switchboard, which became the flagship product of the new company. This switchboard offered greater flexibility and efficiency than earlier designs in handling a large telephone subscriber base at urban exchanges. Kellogg primarily supplied local independent telephone companies.\n\nThe company prospered in the early 20th century. It introduced the Relaymatic automatic switching system in 1939 and a crossbar switching system in 1950.\n\nThe ITT Corporation purchased a controlling interest in the Kellogg Switchboard & Supply Company in 1951, rebranding the new division's equipment as ITT Kellogg for a decade. It then became ITT Telecommunications, but reverted to ITT Kellogg in 1986. Among ITT Kellogg's acquisitions in the 1950s was telephone manufacturer Federal Telephone & Radio.\n\nIn 1989, ITT sold its telecommunications product lines, including ITT Kellogg, to Alcatel, now Alcatel-Lucent. The company's US operations were later sold and privatized. The remaining business of Kellogg is conducted by Cortelco Kellogg, owned by Cortelco (Corinth Telecommunications Corporation) and is based in Corinth, Mississippi."], "wikipedia-629590": ["In the early days of telephony, through roughly the 1960s, companies used manual telephone switchboards, and switchboard operators connected calls by inserting a pair of phone plugs into the appropriate jacks.\n\nBefore the advent of automatic exchanges, an operator's assistance was required for anything other than calling telephones across a shared party line. Callers spoke to an operator at a Central Office who then connected a cord to the proper circuit in order to complete the call. Being in complete control of the call, the operator was in a position to listen to private conversations. Automatic, or Dial systems were developed in the 1920s to reduce labor costs as usage increased, and to ensure privacy to the customer. As phone systems became more sophisticated, less direct intervention by the telephone operator was necessary to complete calls. With the development of computerized telephone dialing systems, many telephone calls which previously required a live operator can be placed automatically by the calling party without additional human intervention.\n\nAs well as the people that were employed by the public networks, operators were required at private branch exchanges (PBX) to answer incoming telephone calls and connect them to the correct extension. Today, most large organizations have direct-dial extensions. Smaller workplaces may have an automated system which allows callers to enter the extension of the called party, or a receptionist who answers calls and performs operator duties."], "wikipedia-1017561": ["A key telephone system was originally distinguished from a private branch exchange in that it did not require an operator or attendant at the switchboard to establish connections between the central office trunks and stations, or between stations. Technologically, private branch exchanges share lineage with central office telephone systems, and in larger or more complex systems, may rival a central office system in capacity and features. With a key telephone system, a station user could control the connections directly using line buttons, which indicated the status of lines with built-in lamps.\n\nNew installations of key telephone systems have become less common, as hybrid systems and private branch exchanges of comparable size have similar cost and greater functionality.\n\nInto the 21st century, the distinction between key systems and PBX systems has become increasingly blurred. Early electronic key systems used dedicated handsets which displayed and allowed access to all connected PSTN lines and stations. \nThe modern key system now supports SIP, ISDN, analog handsets (in addition to its own proprietary handsets - usually digital) as well as a raft of features more traditionally found on larger PBX systems. Their support for both analog and digital signaling, and of some PBX functionality gives rise to the \"hybrid\" designation.\n\nA hybrid system typically has some call appearance buttons that directly correspond to individual lines and/or stations, but may also support direct dialing to extensions or outside lines without selecting a line appearance.\n\nThe modern key system is usually fully digital, although analog variants persist and some systems implement VOIP services. Effectively, the aspects that distinguish a PBX from a hybrid key system are the amount, scope and complexity of the features and facilities offered."], "wikipedia-160834": ["POTS was the standard service offering from telephone companies from 1876 until 1988 in the United States when the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Basic Rate Interface (BRI) was introduced, followed by cellular telephone systems, and voice over IP (VoIP). POTS remains the basic form of residential and small business service connection to the telephone network in many parts of the world. The term reflects the technology that has been available since the introduction of the public telephone system in the late 19th century, in a form mostly unchanged despite the introduction of Touch-Tone dialing, electronic telephone exchanges and fiber-optic communication into the public switched telephone network (PSTN).\n\nAlthough POTS provides limited features, low bandwidth, and no mobile capabilities, it provides greater reliability than other telephony systems (mobile phone, VoIP, etc.). Many telephone service providers attempt to achieve dial-tone availability more than 99.999% of the time the telephone is taken off-hook. This is an often cited benchmark in marketing and systems-engineering comparisons, called the \"five nines\" reliability standard. It is equivalent to having a dial-tone available for all but about five minutes each year."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-28427": 2, "wikipedia-12148146": 2, "wikipedia-32540855": 1, "wikipedia-629590": 2, "wikipedia-18341": 1, "wikipedia-1017561": 2, "wikipedia-2133366": 1, "wikipedia-995064": 1, "wikipedia-160834": 2, "wikipedia-316667": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-28427": 3, "wikipedia-12148146": 3, "wikipedia-32540855": 1, "wikipedia-629590": 3, "wikipedia-18341": 1, "wikipedia-1017561": 3, "wikipedia-2133366": 1, "wikipedia-995064": 1, "wikipedia-160834": 3, "wikipedia-316667": 1}}}

There is no principle that a small number of observations will coincide with the expected value or that a streak of one value will immediately be \"balanced\" by the others (see the gambler's fallacy)."], "wikipedia-187750": ["Very large numbers often occur in fields such as mathematics, cosmology, cryptography, and statistical mechanics. Sometimes people refer to numbers as being \"astronomically large\". However, it is easy to mathematically define numbers that are much larger even than those used in astronomy.\n\nExamples of large numbers describing everyday real-world objects include:\nBULLET::::- The number of bits on a computer hard disk (, typically about 10, 500\u20131000\u00a0GB)\nBULLET::::- The estimated number of atoms in the observable universe (10)\nBULLET::::- Earth's mass consists of about (4x10) nucleons\nBULLET::::- The number of cells in the human body (estimated at 3.72 \u00d7\u200910)\nBULLET::::- The number of neuronal connections in the human brain (estimated at 10)\nBULLET::::- The lower bound on the game-tree complexity of chess, also known as the \"Shannon number\" (estimated at around 10)\nBULLET::::- The Avogadro constant is the number of \"elementary entities\" (usually atoms or molecules) in one mole; the number of atoms in 12\u00a0grams of carbon-12 approximately .\n\nLarge numbers have been central to \u201cstatistics-driven thinking\u201d, which have become \u201cubiquitous in modern society.\u201d Beginning with 17th-century probability theory, statistics have evolved and become integral to both governmental knowledge and power. There is a complex \"reciprocity between modern governments and the mathematical artifacts that both dictate the duties of the state and measure its successes\". These tools include economics, mathematical statistics, medical statistics, probability, psychology, sociology, and surveys. These have led to applied econometrics in modern times.\n\nOther large numbers, as regards length and time, are found in astronomy and cosmology. For example, the current Big Bang model suggests that the universe is 13.8\u00a0billion years (4.355\u2009\u00d7\u200910 seconds) old, and that the observable universe is 93\u00a0billion light years across (8.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910 metres), and contains about 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 stars, organized into around 125\u00a0billion (1.25 \u00d7 10) galaxies, according to Hubble Space Telescope observations. There are about 10 atoms in the observable universe, by rough estimation.\n\nCombinatorial processes rapidly generate even larger numbers. The factorial function, which defines the number of permutations on a set of fixed objects, grows very rapidly with the number of objects. Stirling's formula gives a precise asymptotic expression for this rate of growth.\n\nCombinatorial processes generate very large numbers in statistical mechanics. These numbers are so large that they are typically only referred to using their logarithms.\n\nG\u00f6del numbers, and similar numbers used to represent bit-strings in algorithmic information theory, are very large, even for mathematical statements of reasonable length. However, some pathological numbers are even larger than the G\u00f6del numbers of typical mathematical propositions.\n\nLogician Harvey Friedman has done work related to very large numbers, such as with Kruskal's tree theorem and the Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem."], "wikipedia-1331039": ["The Dirac large numbers hypothesis (LNH) is an observation made by Paul Dirac in 1937 relating ratios of size scales in the Universe to that of force scales.
