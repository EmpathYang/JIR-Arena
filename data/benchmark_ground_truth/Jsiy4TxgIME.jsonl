The field emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies. In particular, 3rd-century astronomers first noted that the ratio of the lengths of two sides of a right-angled triangle depends only on one acute angle of the triangle. These dependencies are now called trigonometric functions.\n\nIf one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees and one of the other angles is known, the third is thereby fixed, because the three angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees. The two acute angles therefore add up to 90 degrees: they are complementary angles. The shape of a triangle is completely determined, except for similarity, by the angles. Once the angles are known, the ratios of the sides are determined, regardless of the overall size of the triangle. If the length of one of the sides is known, the other two are determined.

The adjacent leg is the other side that is adjacent to angle \"A\". The opposite side is the side that is opposite to angle \"A\". The terms perpendicular and base are sometimes used for the opposite and adjacent sides respectively.(see below under Mnemonics).\n\nThe reciprocals of these functions are named the cosecant (csc), secant (sec), and cotangent (cot), respectively:\nThe inverse functions are called the arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent, respectively.

In Indian astronomy, the study of trigonometric functions flourished in the Gupta period, especially due to Aryabhata (sixth century CE), who discovered the sine function. During the Middle Ages, the study of trigonometry continued in Islamic mathematics, by mathematicians such as Al-Khwarizmi and Abu al-Wafa. It became an independent discipline in the Islamic world, where all six trigonometric functions were known. Translations of Arabic and Greek texts led to trigonometry being adopted as a subject in the Latin West beginning in the Renaissance with Regiomontanus. The development of modern trigonometry shifted during the western Age of Enlightenment, beginning with 17th-century mathematics (Isaac Newton and James Stirling) and reaching its modern form with Leonhard Euler (1748).\nSection::::Etymology.\nThe term \"trigonometry\" was derived from Greek \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \"trig\u014dnon\", \"triangle\" and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \"metron\", \"measure\".\nThe modern word \"sine\" is derived from the Latin word \"sinus\", which means \"bay\", \"bosom\" or \"fold\"\nis indirectly, via Indian, Persian and Arabic transmission, derived from the Greek term \"khord\u1e17\" \"bow-string, chord\". The Greek term was adopted into Sanskrit as \"jy\u0101\" \"bow-string\", later also in the variant \"j\u012bv\u0101\".\nSanskrit \"j\u012bv\u0101\" was rendered adopted into Arabic as \"jiba\", written \"jb\" \u062c\u0628. \nThis was then interpreted as the genuine Arabic word \"jayb\", meaning \"bosom, fold, bay\", either by the Arabs or by a mistake of the European translators such as Robert of Chester, who translated \"jayb\" into Latin as \"sinus\". Particularly Fibonacci's \"sinus rectus arcus\" proved influential in establishing the term \"sinus\". The words \"minute\" and \"second\" are derived from the Latin phrases \"partes minutae primae\" and \"partes minutae secundae\". These roughly translate to \"first small parts\" and \"second small parts\".\nSection::::Development.\nSection::::Development.:Ancient Near East.\nThe ancient Egyptians and Babylonians had known of theorems on the ratios of the sides of similar triangles for many centuries. However, as pre-Hellenic societies lacked the concept of an angle measure, they were limited to studying the sides of triangles instead.\nThe Babylonian astronomers kept detailed records on the rising and setting of stars, the motion of the planets, and the solar and lunar eclipses, all of which required familiarity with angular distances measured on the celestial sphere. Based on one interpretation of the Plimpton 322 cuneiform tablet (c. 1900 BC), some have even asserted that the ancient Babylonians had a table of secants. There is, however, much debate as to whether it is a table of Pythagorean triples, a solution of quadratic equations, or a trigonometric table.\nThe Egyptians, on the other hand, used a primitive form of trigonometry for building pyramids in the 2nd millennium BC. The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, written by the Egyptian scribe Ahmes (c. 1680\u20131620 BC), contains the following problem related to trigonometry:\nAhmes' solution to the problem is the ratio of half the side of the base of the pyramid to its height, or the run-to-rise ratio of its face. In other words, the quantity he found for the \"seked\" is the cotangent of the angle to the base of the pyramid and its face.\nSection::::Development.:Classical antiquity.\nAncient Greek and Hellenistic mathematicians made use of the chord. Given a circle and an arc on the circle, the chord is the line that subtends the arc. A chord's perpendicular bisector passes through the center of the circle and bisects the angle. One half of the bisected chord is the sine of one half the bisected angle, that is,\nand consequently the sine function is also known as the \"half-chord\". Due to this relationship, a number of trigonometric identities and theorems that are known today were also known to Hellenistic mathematicians, but in their equivalent chord form.\nAlthough there is no trigonometry in the works of Euclid and Archimedes, in the strict sense of the word, there are theorems presented in a geometric way (rather than a trigonometric way) that are equivalent to specific trigonometric laws or formulas. For instance, propositions twelve and thirteen of book two of the \"Elements\" are the laws of cosines for obtuse and acute angles, respectively. Theorems on the lengths of chords are applications of the law of sines. And Archimedes' theorem on broken chords is equivalent to formulas for sines of sums and differences of angles. To compensate for the lack of a table of chords, mathematicians of Aristarchus' time would sometimes use the statement that, in modern notation, sin\u00a0\"\u03b1\"/sin\u00a0\"\u03b2\"\u00a0<\u00a0\"\u03b1\"/\"\u03b2\"\u00a0<\u00a0tan\u00a0\"\u03b1\"/tan\u00a0\"\u03b2\" whenever 0\u00b0\u00a0<\u00a0\u03b2\u00a0<\u00a0\u03b1\u00a0<\u00a090\u00b0, now known as Aristarchus's inequality.\nThe first trigonometric table was apparently compiled by Hipparchus of Nicaea (180 \u2013 125 BCE), who is now consequently known as \"the father of trigonometry.\" Hipparchus was the first to tabulate the corresponding values of arc and chord for a series of angles.\nAlthough it is not known when the systematic use of the 360\u00b0 circle came into mathematics, it is known that the systematic introduction of the 360\u00b0 circle came a little after Aristarchus of Samos composed \"On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon\" (ca. 260 BC), since he measured an angle in terms of a fraction of a quadrant. It seems that the systematic use of the 360\u00b0 circle is largely due to Hipparchus and his table of chords. Hipparchus may have taken the idea of this division from Hypsicles who had earlier divided the day into 360 parts, a division of the day that may have been suggested by Babylonian astronomy. In ancient astronomy, the zodiac had been divided into twelve \"signs\" or thirty-six \"decans\". A seasonal cycle of roughly 360 days could have corresponded to the signs and decans of the zodiac by dividing each sign into thirty parts and each decan into ten parts. It is due to the Babylonian sexagesimal numeral system that each degree is divided into sixty minutes and each minute is divided into sixty seconds.\nMenelaus of Alexandria (ca. 100 AD) wrote in three books his \"Sphaerica\". In Book I, he established a basis for spherical triangles analogous to the Euclidean basis for plane triangles. He establishes a theorem that is without Euclidean analogue, that two spherical triangles are congruent if corresponding angles are equal, but he did not distinguish between congruent and symmetric spherical triangles. Another theorem that he establishes is that the sum of the angles of a spherical triangle is greater than 180\u00b0. Book II of \"Sphaerica\" applies spherical geometry to astronomy. And Book III contains the \"theorem of Menelaus\". He further gave his famous \"rule of six quantities\".\nLater, Claudius Ptolemy (ca. 90 \u2013 ca. 168 AD) expanded upon Hipparchus' \"Chords in a Circle\" in his \"Almagest\", or the \"Mathematical Syntaxis\". The Almagest is primarily a work on astronomy, and astronomy relies on trigonometry. Ptolemy's table of chords gives the lengths of chords of a circle of diameter 120 as a function of the number of degrees\u00a0\"n\" in the corresponding arc of the circle, for \"n\" ranging from 1/2 to 180 by increments of\u00a01/2. The thirteen books of the \"Almagest\" are the most influential and significant trigonometric work of all antiquity. A theorem that was central to Ptolemy's calculation of chords was what is still known today as Ptolemy's theorem, that the sum of the products of the opposite sides of a cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the product of the diagonals. A special case of Ptolemy's theorem appeared as proposition 93 in Euclid's \"Data\". Ptolemy's theorem leads to the equivalent of the four sum-and-difference formulas for sine and cosine that are today known as Ptolemy's formulas, although Ptolemy himself used chords instead of sine and cosine. Ptolemy further derived the equivalent of the half-angle formula\nPtolemy used these results to create his trigonometric tables, but whether these tables were derived from Hipparchus' work cannot be determined.\nNeither the tables of Hipparchus nor those of Ptolemy have survived to the present day, although descriptions by other ancient authors leave little doubt that they once existed.\nPythagoras discovered many of the properties of what would become trigonometric functions. The Pythagorean Theorem, p + b = h is a representation of the fundamental trigonometric"], "wikipedia-22228915": ["Solution of triangles () is the main trigonometric problem of finding the characteristics of a triangle (angles and lengths of sides), when some of these are known.

The classical plane trigonometry problem is to specify three of the six characteristics and determine the other three. A triangle can be uniquely determined in this sense when given any of the following:\nBULLET::::- Three sides (SSS)\nBULLET::::- Two sides and the included angle (SAS)\nBULLET::::- Two sides and an angle not included between them (SSA), if the side length adjacent to the angle is shorter than the other side length.\nBULLET::::- A side and the two angles adjacent to it (ASA)\nBULLET::::- A side, the angle opposite to it and an angle adjacent to it (AAS).\nBULLET::::- Three angles (AAA) on the sphere (but not in the plane).\nFor all cases in the plane, at least one of the side lengths must be specified. If only the angles are given, the side lengths cannot be determined, because any similar triangle is a solution.\nSection::::Solving plane triangles.:Trigonomic relations.\nThe standard method of solving the problem is to use fundamental relations.\nBULLET::::- Law of cosines:\nBULLET::::- Law of sines:\nBULLET::::- Sum of angles:\nBULLET::::- Law of tangents:\nThere are other (sometimes practically useful) universal relations: the law of cotangents and Mollweide's formula."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-6600160": 1, "wikipedia-2376606": 1, "wikipedia-650405": 1, "wikipedia-22850636": 1, "wikipedia-18717261": 1, "wikipedia-24400467": 1, "wikipedia-5317064": 1, "wikipedia-52263710": 1, "wikipedia-22990907": 1, "wikipedia-22228915": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-6600160": 2, "wikipedia-2376606": 1, "wikipedia-650405": 1, "wikipedia-22850636": 2, "wikipedia-18717261": 1, "wikipedia-24400467": 1, "wikipedia-5317064": 1, "wikipedia-52263710": 1, "wikipedia-22990907": 1, "wikipedia-22228915": 2}}}

This equation is known as Brewster's law, and the angle defined by it is Brewster's angle.\nThe physical mechanism for this can be qualitatively understood from the manner in which electric dipoles in the media respond to \"p\"-polarized light. One can imagine that light incident on the surface is absorbed, and then re-radiated by oscillating electric dipoles at the interface between the two media. The polarization of freely propagating light is always perpendicular to the direction in which the light is travelling. The dipoles that produce the transmitted (refracted) light oscillate in the polarization direction of that light. These same oscillating dipoles also generate the reflected light.

Instead, they use the CORDIC algorithm or a complex formula such as the following Taylor series to compute the value of sine to a high degree of precision:\n\nHowever, this can be expensive to compute, especially on slow processors, and there are many applications, particularly in traditional computer graphics, that need to compute many thousands of sine values every second. A common solution is to initially compute the sine of many evenly distributed values, and then to find the sine of \"x\" we choose the sine of the value closest to \"x\". This will be close to the correct value because sine is a continuous function with a bounded rate of change. For example:\n\nUnfortunately, the table requires quite a bit of space: if IEEE double-precision floating-point numbers are used, over 16,000 bytes would be required. We can use fewer samples, but then our precision will significantly worsen. One good solution is linear interpolation, which draws a line between the two points in the table on either side of the value and locates the answer on that line. This is still quick to compute, and much more accurate for smooth functions such as the sine function. Here is an example using linear interpolation:\n\nLinear interpolation provides for an interpolated function that is continuous, but will not, in general, have continuous derivatives. For smoother interpolation of table lookup that is continuous and has continuous first derivative, one should use the cubic hermite spline.\n\nAnother solution that uses a quarter of the space but takes a bit longer to compute would be to take into account the relationships between sine and cosine along with their symmetry rules. In this case, the lookup table is calculated by using the sine function for the first quadrant (i.e. sin(0..pi/2)). When we need a value, we assign a variable to be the angle wrapped to the first quadrant. We then wrap the angle to the four quadrants (not needed if values are always between 0 and 2*pi) and return the correct value (i.e. first quadrant is a straight return, second quadrant is read from pi/2-x, third and fourth are negatives of the first and second respectively). For cosine, we only have to return the angle shifted by pi/2 (i.e. x+pi/2). For tangent, we divide the sine by the cosine (divide-by-zero handling may be needed depending on implementation):\n\nWhen using interpolation, the size of the lookup table can be reduced by using \"nonuniform sampling\", which means that where the function is close to straight, we use few sample points, while where it changes value quickly we use more sample points to keep the approximation close to the real curve.

The cosine, cotangent, and cosecant are so named because they are respectively the sine, tangent, and secant of the complementary angle abbreviated to \"co-\".\n\nWith these functions, one can answer virtually all questions about arbitrary triangles by using the law of sines and the law of cosines. These laws can be used to compute the remaining angles and sides of any triangle as soon as two sides and their included angle or two angles and a side or three sides are known.

Privacy boundaries draw divisions between private information and public information. This theory argues that when people disclose private information, they depend on a rule-based management system to control the level of accessibility. An individual's privacy boundary governs his or her self-disclosures. Once a disclosure is made, the negotiation of privacy rules between the two parties is required. A distressing sense of \"boundary turbulence\" can arise when clashing expectations for privacy management are identified. Having the mental image of protective boundaries is central to understanding the five core principles of Petronio's CPM: \n\n(1) People believe they own and have a right to control their private information. (2) People control their private information through the use of personal privacy rules. (3) When others are told or given access to a person's private information, they become co-owners of that information. (4) Co-owners of private information need to negotiate mutually agreeable privacy rules about telling others. (5) When co-owners of private information don't effectively negotiate and follow mutually held privacy rules, boundary turbulence is the likely result.\n\nTo understand CPM theory it is important to follow the metaphor of the boundary. Private boundaries are the division between private information and public information. When private information is shared, there will be a collective boundary. When private information remains with an individual and is not disclosed, the boundary is called a personal boundary. An individual's private information is protected by their boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing. Boundaries can be relatively permeable (easy to cross) or relatively impregnable (rigid and difficult to cross).\n\nAn individual's private information is protected by the individual's boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing, and allow certain parts of the public access to certain pieces of information belonging to the individual. Once private information is shared, co-owners must coordinate the boundaries of privacy and disclosure based on boundary permeability, boundary linkage, and boundary ownership. Petronio describes this mutual boundary coordination by co-owners as drawing the same borders on a map around a shared piece of information. By no means is this an easy process considering that each owner will approach the information from distinct viewpoints and referencing their personal criteria for privacy rule development.\n\n- Boundary permeability refers to the nature of the invisible divisions that keep private information from being known outside of an individual or particular group. When private information is kept with one owner, the boundaries are said to be thick because there is less possibility for information to make its way out into the public sphere. Once information is shared to one or more persons, the boundaries for that private information expand, become more permeable, and are considered \"thin\".\n\n- Boundary linkage has to do with how owners are connected when they build associations through a boundary. For example, doctors and patients are linked to each other in such a way that private information is passed within their boundaries constantly. These linkages can be strong or weak depending on how information was shared or whether a co-owner wanted to know or was prepared to learn a new piece of information. Case in point, the link between an organization and a spy meant to infiltrate the organization is weak because the two are not coordinated on how information will be maintained private or disclosed.\n\n- Boundary ownership refers to the responsibilities and rights each person has over the control of the spread of information that they own. When working to mutually create the boundary of privacy it is key for all parties to have a clear understanding of whether information should be shared, who it should be shared with, and when it should be shared. A simple example of this is the planning of a surprise birthday party; all those involved in planning must agree on how the information about the party will be spread so as not to ruin the surprise. As new guests are invited, they become an owner of the information and are bound to the rules of privacy maintenance, or else the surprise could be ruined."], "wikipedia-2512966": ["Ecological units\" exist at the interface between the ecological environment and certain practice of molar behavior.

People with thick boundaries differentiate clearly between reality and fantasy and between self and other, and tend to prefer well-defined social structures. The concept was developed by psychoanalyst Ernest Hartmann from his observations of the personality characteristics of frequent nightmare sufferers. The construct has been particularly studied in relation to dream recall and lucid dreaming.\n\nDr. Ernest Hartmann observed that people who suffer frequent nightmares had distinctive personality characteristics he described as \"unguarded\", \"undefended\", \"vulnerable\", \"artistic\", and \"open\". People with these characteristics seem unable to screen out frightening images and feelings originating in their dreams. They also lack barriers between their own identity and those of others, or between their own beliefs and unconventional ideas. Hartmann proposed that such people have \"thin\" boundaries between their mental processes and argued that thinness or thickness of boundaries was \"a broad dimension of personality and an aspect of the overall organization of the mind.\" He considered the concept to be similar to William James' concept of \"tender-mindedness\" and to Blatt and Ritzler's \"permeable ego boundaries\".
