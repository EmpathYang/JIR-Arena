He was an early proponent of Leibnizian calculus and sided with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz during the Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy. He is known for his numerous contributions to calculus, and along with his brother Johann, was one of the founders of the calculus of variations. He also discovered the fundamental mathematical constant e. However, his most important contribution was in the field of probability, where he derived the first version of the law of large numbers in his work \"Ars Conjectandi\".\n\nIn 1683 Bernoulli discovered the constant e by studying a question about compound interest which required him to find the value of the following expression (which is in fact ):\nOne example is an account that starts with $1.00 and pays 100 percent interest per year. If the interest is credited once, at the end of the year, the value is $2.00; but if the interest is computed and added twice in the year, the $1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice, yielding $1.00\u00d71.5\u00b2 = $2.25. Compounding quarterly yields $1.00\u00d71.25 = $2.4414..., and compounding monthly yields $1.00\u00d7(1.0833...) = $2.613035...\nBernoulli noticed that this sequence approaches a limit (the force of interest) for more and smaller compounding intervals.

It could correspond to choosing the \"best\" alternative from a set of available alternatives (where \"best\" can be interpreted as \"the most preferred alternative\" of a decision-maker). Another interpretation of \"solving\" could be choosing a small set of good alternatives, or grouping alternatives into different preference sets. An extreme interpretation could be to find all \"efficient\" or \"nondominated\" alternatives (which we will define shortly). The difficulty of the problem originates from the presence of more than one criterion. There is no longer a unique optimal solution to an MCDM problem that can be obtained without incorporating preference information. The concept of an optimal solution is often replaced by the set of nondominated solutions. A nondominated solution has the property that it is not possible to move away from it to any other solution without sacrificing in at least one criterion. Therefore, it makes sense for the decision-maker to choose a solution from the nondominated set. Otherwise, she/he could do better in terms of some or all of the criteria, and not do worse in any of them.

Although it is accepted that spacing is beneficial in learning a subject well and previous units should be revisited and practiced, textbooks are written in discrete chapters that do not support these findings. Rohrer conducted a two-part study in 2006 where students were taught how to solve math problems. In part 1, students either used mass or spaced practice, and spaced practice showed significant improvement over mass practice when tested one week later. In the second part of the experiment, practice problems were either grouped by type or mixed randomly. The desirable difficulties encountered by the randomly mixed problems were effective, and the performance by students who solved the randomly mixed problems was vastly superior to the students who solved the problems grouped by type. The reasoning behind this increased performance was that students know the formula for solving equations, but do not always know when to apply the formula. By shuffling problems around and dispersing them across multiple chapters, students also learn to identify when it is appropriate to use which formula. There is conclusive evidence that cumulative final exams promote long-term retention by forcing spaced learning to occur.\nSection::::Practical applications and long-term retention.:Learning and pedagogy.\nThe long-term effects of spacing have also been assessed in the context of learning a foreign language. Bahrick et al. (1993) examined the retention of newly learned foreign vocabulary words as a function of relearning sessions and intersession spacing over a 9-year period.\nBoth the amount of relearning session and the number of days in between each session have a major impact on retention (the repetition effect and the spacing effect), yet the two variables do not interact with each other.\nFor all three difficulty rankings of the foreign words, recall was highest for the 56-day interval as opposed to a 28-day or a 14-day interval. Additionally, 13 sessions spaced 56 days apart yielded comparable retention to 26 sessions with a 14-day interval.\nThese findings have implications for educational practices. Current school and university curricula rarely provide students with opportunities for periodic retrieval of previously acquired knowledge. Without spaced repetitions, students are more likely to forget foreign language vocabulary.\nSection::::Practical applications and long-term retention.:Lag effect.\nWhile the spacing effect refers to improved recall for spaced versus successive (mass) repetition, the term 'lag' can be interpreted as the time interval between repetitions of learning. The \"lag effect\" is simply an idea branching off the spacing effect that states recall after long lags between learning is better versus short lags. Michael Kahana's study showed strong evidence that the lag effect is present when recalling word lists. In 2008, Kornell and Bjork published a study that suggested inductive learning is more effective when spaced than massed. Inductive learning is learning through observation of exemplars, so the participants did not actively take notes or solve problems. These results were replicated and backed up by a second independent study."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-7521201": 1, "wikipedia-980207": 1, "wikipedia-33232239": 1, "wikipedia-3431840": 1, "wikipedia-33649737": 1, "wikipedia-40903837": 1, "wikipedia-903495": 1, "wikipedia-67491": 1, "wikipedia-37837121": 1, "wikipedia-2610792": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-7521201": 1, "wikipedia-980207": 1, "wikipedia-33232239": 1, "wikipedia-3431840": 1, "wikipedia-33649737": 1, "wikipedia-40903837": 1, "wikipedia-903495": 2, "wikipedia-67491": 1, "wikipedia-37837121": 1, "wikipedia-2610792": 1}}}

It includes introspection, aptitudinal self-knowledge, emotional self-knowledge, self-criticism and awareness of oneself.\nBULLET::::- Self-evaluation the second competence of this Emotional thought method. This competence has a basic relationship with the concept of self and self-esteem. In this method, self-esteem is the real driving force of people's behaviour. When people feel unhappy, they feel they do not have enough strength to work, to make relationships with others or to live. On the contrary, when people feel happy with themselves, then they feel that they can face new challenges and projects and get involved in life problems. This competence is the result of developing sensibility, sensuality, sexuality, a right aptitudinal and emotional evaluation, optimism, happiness and self-esteem.\nBULLET::::- Emotional control is the third one. Emotions are the tool used by animals to survive. Emotions provide animals and people a quick response against their enemies. Stress, fear and anxiety are emotions that help to avoid external attacks through reacting with the alert, retreat or, even, the attack to the dangers that may come from the outside. But according to the method, if people do not manage these primary emotions, they can be managed by them. So this competence develops three emotional skills as: motor inhibition, self-control and mental control.\nBULLET::::- Personal motivation is the last competence developed by the Emotional thought method in order to reach targets. Motivation is the force of the behaviour and of the life of people and that is why our interests and desires influence the actions we carry out every day. Expectations, dreams and enthusiasm (specially this last one) are the real force to work, to love, to live. The Emotional thinking method presents a set of competencies to be developed, as: activation, productivity, quality, instrumental tools, globality, planning, culture, innovation, interests' wideness, determination and evaluation.\nBULLET::::- There are three competences in this emotional method oriented to how to make a relationship with other people. So the fifth competence in the Emotional thought method is Knowledge of the others. The success in life depends extremely on how people get along with others living close to them. So, it is very important to know their personality, what are they interested in, which are their needs. Knowledge of the personality of others, knowledge of their aptitudes, empathy, communication ability, social analysis, appreciation of diversity are some of the abilities developed in this fifth part of the method.\nBULLET::::- Appreciation of the other is the sixth competence of the Emotional thought method. The way you appreciate the people is a determining competence to increase your position in the relationship made with them. In this method, ten abilities are proposed for the development of this competence. They are structured in four groups.\nBULLET::::1. The first group concerns the necessary capacities for a relationship: approximation, affability and tolerance.\nBULLET::::2. The second group includes the capacities for creating a link: confidence, comprehension and sociability.\nBULLET::::3. The third group includes three levels of approximation: companionship, friendship and love.\nBULLET::::4. Finally, there is responsibility, as the summary of all of them.\nBULLET::::- The last competence developed in the Emotional thought method is: Control of others. Many people criticise this competence because they say that it is not respectful with them. But everyone wants to persuade other people to do what they are interested in. So the seventh competence of this method develops the capacity to have relations, the capacity for organizating groups, the capacity to solve conflicts, and, especially, leadership."], "wikipedia-34023280": ["The Disney Method, developed by Robert Dilts in 1994, is a complex creativity strategy in which a group uses four specific thinking styles in turn.

Working together as a single system, called the \u201cinterpreter,\u201d they organize the content of consciousness.

A person doing long multiplication on paper will write down all the products and then add them together; an abacus-user will sum the products as soon as each one is computed.\n\nSection::::Lattice multiplication.\nLattice, or sieve, multiplication is algorithmically equivalent to long multiplication. It requires the preparation of a lattice (a grid drawn on paper) which guides the calculation and separates all the multiplications from the additions.

Matrak\u00e7\u0131 Nasuh presented 6 different variants of this method in this 16th-century book, Umdet-ul Hisab. It was widely used in Enderun schools across the Ottoman Empire. Napier's bones, or Napier's rods also used this method, as published by Napier in 1617, the year of his death.\nAs shown in the example, the multiplicand and multiplier are written above and to the right of a lattice, or a sieve.

Such is the case in Henry IV's 1404 statute against the craft of multiplication. Henry VI began to issue patents for the practice of alchemy, but the parliamentary act against multipliers was not repealed until 1689.\nSection::::Method.\nIn his discussion of multiplication, Ripley goes on to compare the medicine or elixir to fire.

Consider the following:\nThe second and fourth row of the summands are equivalent to the first term. Production of the summands requires a simple AND gate for each summand. Given enough AND gates, the time to produce the summands will be one cycle of the arithmetic logic unit.\nSection::::Steps.:Reduction of summands.\nThe summands are reduced using a common 1-bit full adder that accepts two 1-bit terms and a carry-in bit. It produces a sum and a carry-out. The full adders are arranged such that the sum remains in the same column of summands, but the carry-out is shifted left. In each round of reduction, three bits in a single column are used as the two terms and carry-in for the full adder, producing a single sum bit for the column. This reduces the bits in the column by a factor of 3. However, the column to the right will shift over carry-out bits, increasing the bits in the column by a third of the number of rows of summands. At worst, the reduction will be 2/3 the number of rows per round of reduction.\nThe following shows how the first round of reduction is performed. Note that all \"empty\" positions of the summands are considered to be zero (a . is used here as indicator of the \"assumed zero values\"). In each row, the top three bits are the three inputs to the full adder (two terms and carry-in). The sum is placed in the top bit of the column. The carry-out is placed in the second row of the column to the left. The bottom bit is a single feed into an adder. The sum of this adder is placed in the third row of the column. Carry-out is ignored as it will always be zero, but by design it would be placed in the fourth row of the column to the left. For design, it is important to note that rows 1, 3, 5, ... (counting from the top) are filled with sums from the column itself. Rows 2, 4, 6, ... are filled with carry-out values from the column to the right.\nReduction is performed again in exactly the same way. This time, only the top three rows of summands are of interest because all other summands must be zero.\nWhen there are only two significant rows of summands, the reduction cycles end. A basic full adder normally requires three cycles of the arithmetic logic unit. Therefore, each cycle of reduction is commonly 3 cycles long.\nSection::::Steps.:Summation.\nWhen there are only two rows of summands remaining, they are added using a fast adder. There are many designs of fast adders, any of which may be used to complete this algorithm.\nSection::::Calculation time.\nThe calculation time for the reduction of summands algorithm is: \"T\" = 1\u0394t + r3\u0394t + FA (where r is the number of reduction cycles and FA is the time for the fast adder at the end of the algorithm)."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-20845": 2, "wikipedia-57411": 2, "wikipedia-296942": 1, "wikipedia-2428537": 1, "wikipedia-18421485": 1, "wikipedia-28430974": 1, "wikipedia-16218170": 1, "wikipedia-725467": 1, "wikipedia-976642": 1, "wikipedia-2384297": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-20845": 3, "wikipedia-57411": 3, "wikipedia-296942": 2, "wikipedia-2428537": 2, "wikipedia-18421485": 1, "wikipedia-28430974": 2, "wikipedia-16218170": 1, "wikipedia-725467": 1, "wikipedia-976642": 1, "wikipedia-2384297": 1}}}

This formula is provided using the financial function PMT in a spreadsheet such as Excel. In the example, the monthly payment is obtained by entering either of these formulas:\nThe following derivation of this formula illustrates how fixed-rate mortgage loans work. The amount owed on the loan at the end of every month equals the amount owed from the previous month, plus the interest on this amount, minus the fixed amount paid every month. This fact results in the debt schedule:\nThe polynomial formula_10 appearing before the fixed monthly payment \"c\" (with formula_11) is a geometric series, which has a simple closed-form expression obtained from observing that formula_12 because all but the first and last terms in this difference cancel each other out. Therefore, solving for formula_13 yields the much simpler closed-form expression\nApplying this formula to the amount owed at the end of the \"N\"th month gives (using formula_15 to succinctly denote the function value formula_13 at argument value \"x\" = (1+\"r\" )):\nThe amount of the monthly payment at the end of month \"N\" that is applied to principal paydown equals the amount \"c\" of payment minus the amount of interest currently paid on the pre-existing unpaid principal. The latter amount, the interest component of the current payment, is the interest rate \"r\" times the amount unpaid at the end of month \"N\"\u20131. Since in the early years of the mortgage the unpaid principal is still large, so are the interest payments on it; so the portion of the monthly payment going toward paying down the principal is very small and equity in the property accumulates very slowly (in the absence of changes in the market value of the property). But in the later years of the mortgage, when the principal has already been substantially paid down and not much monthly interest needs to be paid, most of the monthly payment goes toward repayment of the principal, and the remaining principal declines rapidly.\nThe borrower's equity in the property equals the current market value of the property minus the amount owed according to the above formula.\nWith a fixed rate mortgage, the borrower agrees to pay off the loan completely at the end of the loan's term, so the amount owed at month \"N\" must be zero. For this to happen, the monthly payment \"c\" can be obtained from the previous equation to obtain:\nwhich is the formula originally provided. This derivation illustrates three key components of fixed-rate loans: (1) the fixed monthly payment depends upon the amount borrowed, the interest rate, and the length of time over which the loan is repaid; (2) the amount owed every month equals the amount owed from the previous month plus interest on that amount, minus the fixed monthly payment; (3) the fixed monthly payment is chosen so that the loan is paid off in full with interest at the end of its term and no more money is owed."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-2540136": 3, "wikipedia-786751": 1, "wikipedia-43091465": 2, "wikipedia-4159673": 1, "wikipedia-36916458": 1, "wikipedia-7094957": 1, "wikipedia-343496": 1, "wikipedia-5323705": 1, "wikipedia-26496518": 1, "wikipedia-14108720": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-2540136": 3, "wikipedia-786751": 2, "wikipedia-43091465": 3, "wikipedia-4159673": 1, "wikipedia-36916458": 1, "wikipedia-7094957": 1, "wikipedia-343496": 2, "wikipedia-5323705": 2, "wikipedia-26496518": 1, "wikipedia-14108720": 1}}}

Understanding these effects is part of the study of ecological rationality. One popular less-is-more effect was found in comparing the take-the-best heuristic with a linear decision strategy in making judgments about which of two objects has a higher value on some criterion. Whereas the linear decision strategy uses all available cues and weighs them, the take-the-best heuristic uses only the first cue that differs between the objects. Despite this frugality, the heuristic yielded more accurate judgments than the linear decision strategy. Some less-is-more effects can be explained within the framework of bias and variance. According to the bias-variance tradeoff, errors in prediction are due to two sources. Consider a decision strategy that uses a random sample of objects to make a judgment about an object outside of this sample. Due to sampling variance, there is a large number of hypothetical predictions, each based on a different random sample. Bias refers to the difference between the average of these hypothetical predictions and the true value of the object to be judged. In contrast, variance refers to the average variation of the hypothetical judgments around their average. The variance component of judgment error depends on the degree to which the decision strategy adapts to each possible sample. One major determinant of this degree is a strategy's number of free parameters. Therefore, (heuristic) strategies that use with fewer pieces of information and have fewer parameters tend to have lower error from variance than strategies with more parameters. At the same time, fewer parameters tend to increase the error from bias, implying that heuristic strategies are more likely to be biased than strategies that use more pieces of information. The exact amount of bias, however, depends on the specific problem to which a decision strategy is applied. If the decision problem has a statistical structure that matches the structure of the heuristic strategy, the bias can be surprisingly small. For example, analyses of the take-the-best heuristic and other lexicographic heuristics have shown that the bias of these strategies is equal to the bias of the linear strategy when the weights of the linear strategy show specific regularities that were found to be prevalent in many real-life situations."], "wikipedia-223321": ["It is the idea that quality does not necessarily increase with functionality\u2014that there is a point where less functionality (\"worse\") is a preferable option (\"better\") in terms of practicality and usability.

Thus its use will spread rapidly, long before a program developed using the MIT approach has a chance to be developed and deployed (first-mover advantage). Once it has spread, there will be pressure to improve its functionality, but users have already been conditioned to accept \"worse\" rather than the \"right thing\". \"Therefore, the worse-is-better software first will gain acceptance, second will condition its users to expect less, and third will be improved to a point that is almost the right thing.\""], "wikipedia-23631497": ["The explicit capture of design rationale serves to help avoid repeating past mistakes, provides a direct means for determining the impact of proposed design changes, forces the explicit statement of goals and assumptions, and aids in the communication of final system specifications.\n\nRationale capture is applicable to all phases of the system development process.

For example, a voluntary exchange that creates pollution would be a \"Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement\" if the buyers and sellers are still willing to carry out the transaction even if they have to fully compensate the victims of the pollution. Kaldor\u2013Hicks does not require compensation actually be paid, merely that the possibility for compensation exists, and thus need not leave each at least as well off. Under Kaldor\u2013Hicks efficiency, an improvement can in fact leave some people worse off. Pareto-improvements require making every party involved better off (or at least none worse off). While every Pareto improvement is a Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement, most Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvements are not Pareto improvements. This is because the set of Pareto improvements is a proper subset of Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvements. This reflects the greater flexibility and applicability of the Kaldor\u2013Hicks criterion relative to the Pareto criterion. The Kaldor\u2013Hicks criterion is widely applied in welfare economics and managerial economics. For example, it forms an underlying rationale for cost\u2013benefit analysis. In cost\u2013benefit analysis, a project (for example, a new airport) is evaluated by comparing the total costs, such as building costs and environmental costs, with the total benefits, such as airline profits and convenience for travelers. (However, as cost\u2013benefit analysis may also assign different social welfare weights to different individuals, e.g. more to the poor, the compensation criterion is not always invoked by cost\u2013benefit analysis.) The project would typically be given the go-ahead if the benefits exceed the costs. This is effectively an application of the Kaldor\u2013Hicks criterion because it is equivalent to requiring that the benefits be enough that those that benefit could in theory compensate those that have lost out. The criterion is used because it is argued that it is justifiable for society as a whole to make some worse off if this means a greater gain for others."], "wikipedia-49648894": ["Simulation-based optimization integrates optimization techniques into simulation analysis. Because of the complexity of the simulation, the objective function may become difficult and expensive to evaluate. Once a system is mathematically modeled, computer-based simulations provide information about its behavior. Parametric simulation methods can be used to improve the performance of a system. In this method, the input of each variable is varied with other parameters remaining constant and the effect on the design objective is observed. This is a time-consuming method and improves the performance partially. To obtain the optimal solution with minimum computation and time, the problem is solved iteratively where in each iteration the solution moves closer to the optimum solution. Such methods are known as \u2018numerical optimization\u2019 or \u2018simulation-based optimization\u2019. In simulation experiment, the goal is to evaluate the effect of different values of input variables on a system. However, the interest is sometimes in finding the optimal value for input variables in terms of the system outcomes. One way could be running simulation experiments for all possible input variables. However, this approach is not always practical due to several possible situations and it just makes it intractable to run experiments for each scenario. For example, there might be too many possible values for input variables, or the simulation model might be too complicated and expensive to run for suboptimal input variable values. In these cases, the goal is to find optimal values for the input variables rather than trying all possible values. This process is called simulation optimization. Metamodels enable researchers to obtain reliable approximate model outputs without running expensive and time-consuming computer simulations.

In other cases the improved software should behave identically to the old version but is better because, for example: it runs faster, it uses less memory, it uses less energy or it runs on a different type of computer. GI differs from, for example, formal program translation, in that it primarily verifies the behaviour of the new mutant version by running both the new and the old software on test inputs and comparing their output and performance in order to see if the new software can still do what is wanted of the original program and is now better. Genetic improvement can be used to create multiple versions of programs, each tailored to be better for a particular use or for a particular computer. Genetic improvement can be used with Multi-objective optimization to consider improving software along multiple dimensions or to consider trade-offs between several objectives, such as asking GI to evolve programs which trade speed against the quality of answers they give.

Employers that are transparent about the positive and negative aspects of the job, as well as the challenges and expectations are positioning themselves to recruit and retain stronger candidates.\n\"Selection\" \u2013 There are plethora of selection tools that can help predict job performance and subsequently retention. These include both subjective and objective methods and while organizations are accustomed to using more subjective tools such as interviews, application and resume evaluations, objective methods are increasing in popularity. For example, utilizing biographical data during selection can be an effective technique. Biodata empirically identifies life experiences that differentiate those who stay with an organization and those who quit. Life experiences associated with employees may include tenure on previous jobs, education experiences, and involvement and leadership in related work experiences.\n\"Socialization\" \u2013 Socialization practices delivered via a strategic onboarding and assimilation program can help new employees become embedded in the company and thus more likely to stay. Research has shown that socialization practices can help new hires become embedded in the company and thus more likely to stay. These practices include shared and individualized learning experiences, activities that allow people to get to know one another. Such practices may include providing employees with a role model, mentor or trainer or providing timely and adequate feedback.\n\"Training and development\" \u2013 Providing ample training and development opportunities can discourage turnover by keeping employees satisfied and well-positioned for future growth opportunities. In fact, dissatisfaction with potential career development is one of the top three reasons employees (35%) often feel inclined to look elsewhere. if employees are not given opportunities to continually update their skills, they are more likely to leave. Those who receive more training are less likely to quit than those who receive little or no training. Employers that fear providing training will make their employees more marketable and thus increase turnover can offer job specific training, which is less transferable to other contexts. Additionally, employers can increase retention through development opportunities such as allowing employees to further their education and reimbursing tuition for employees who remain with the company for a specified amount of time.\n\"Compensation and rewards\" \u2013 Pay levels and satisfaction are only modest predictors of an employee's decision to leave the organization; however organizations can lead the market with a strong compensation and reward package as 53% of employees often look elsewhere because of poor compensation and benefits. Organizations can explicitly link rewards to retention (i.e. vacation hours to seniority, offer retention Bonus payments or Employee stock options, or define benefit plan payouts to years of services) Research has shown that defined compensation and rewards as associated with longer tenure. Additionally, organizations can also look to intrinsic rewards such as increased decision-making autonomy.\n\"Effective Leaders\" \u2013 An employee's relationship with his/her immediately ranking supervisor or manager is equally important to keeping to making an employee feel embedded and valued within the organization. Supervisors need to know how to motivate their employees and reduce cost while building loyalty in their key people. Managers need to reinforce employee productivity and open communication, to coach employees and provide meaningful feedback and inspire employees to work as an effective team. In order to achieve this, organizations need to prepare managers and supervisors to lead and develop effective relationships with their subordinates. Executive Coaching can help increase an individual's effectiveness as a leader as well as boast a climate of learning, trust and teamwork in an organization. to encourage supervisors to focus on retention among their teams, organizations can incorporate a retention metric into their organization's evaluation.\n\"Employee Engagement\" \u2013 Employees who are satisfied with their jobs, enjoy their work and the organization, believe their job to be more important, take pride in the company and feel their contributions are impactful are five times less likely to quit than employees who were not engaged. Engaged employees give their companies crucial competitive advantages, including higher productivity and lower employee turnover."], "wikipedia-35670204": ["BULLET::::1.

This method, that wants to define the motives that drive the decision-making process, is still in development.\nRationale is the reason, justification, underlying motivation, or excuse that moved the designer to select a particular strategy or design feature. More simply, rationale is interpreted as the answer to the question, \u201cWhy is this design being done in this manner?\u201d Most design methods focus on what the design is (i.e., on the final product, rather than why the design is the way it is). \nIDEF6 is part of the IDEF family of modeling languages in the field of systems and software engineering.\nSection::::Overview.\nWhen explicitly captured, design rationale typically exists in the form of unstructured textual comments. In addition to making it difficult, if not impossible to find relevant information on demand, lack of a structured method for organizing and providing completeness criteria for design rationale capture makes it unlikely that important information will be documented. Unlike design methods which serve to document WHAT a design is (Design Specification), the IDEF6 Design Rationale Capture Method is targeted at capturing:\nBULLET::::- WHY a design is the way it is\nBULLET::::- WHY it is not manifested in some other form, and\nBULLET::::- HOW the final design configuration was reached.\nIDEF6 was intended to be a method with the representational capability to capture information system design rationale and associate that rationale with the design models and documentation for the end system. Thus, IDEF6 attempts to capture the logic underlying the decisions contributing to, or resulting in, the final design. The explicit capture of design rationale serves to help avoid repeating past mistakes, provides a direct means for determining the impact of proposed design changes, forces the explicit statement of goals and assumptions, and aids in the communication of final system specifications. \nIDEF6 will be a method that possesses the conceptual resources and linguistic capabilities needed \nBULLET::::- to represent the nature and structure of the information that constitutes design rationale within a given system, and\nBULLET::::- to associate that rationale with design specifications, models, and documentation for the system.\nThe scope of IDEF6 applicability covers all phases of the information system development process, from initial conceptualization through both preliminary and detailed design activities. To the extent that detailed design decisions for software systems are relegated to the coding phase, the IDEF6 technique should be usable during the software construction process as well.\nDesign rationale becomes important when a design decision is not completely determined by the constraints of the situation. Thus, decision points must be identified, the situations and constraints associated with those decision points must be defined, and if options exist, the rationale for the chosen option and for discarding other options (i.e., those design options not chosen) must be recorded. The task of capturing design rationale serves the following purposes:\nBULLET::::- Enables evolutionary integration of enterprise information systems.\nBULLET::::- Enables the use of concurrent engineering methods in information systems development.\nBULLET::::- Supports better integration among life-cycle artifacts.\nBULLET::::- Facilitates business reengineering by capturing the rationale behind business case decisions.\nBULLET::::- Enables efficient traceability of decisions."], "wikipedia-68759": ["A Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement, named for Nicholas Kaldor and John Hicks, is an economic re-allocation of resources among people that captures some of the intuitive appeal of a Pareto improvement, but has less stringent criteria and is hence applicable to more circumstances. A re-allocation is a Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement if those that are made better off could hypothetically compensate those that are made worse off and lead to a Pareto-improving outcome. The compensation does not actually have to occur (there is no presumption in favor of status-quo) and thus, a Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement can in fact leave some people worse off.\nA situation is said to be Kaldor\u2013Hicks efficient, or equivalently is said to satisfy the Kaldor\u2013Hicks criterion, if no potential Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement from that situation exists.\nSection::::Explanation.\nA reallocation is said to be a Pareto improvement if at least one person is made better off and nobody is made worse off. However in practice, it is almost impossible to take any social action, such as a change in economic policy, without making at least one person worse off. Even voluntary exchanges may not be Pareto improving if they make third parties worse off.\nUsing the criterion for Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement, an outcome is an improvement if those that are made better off could in principle compensate those that are made worse off, so that a Pareto improving outcome \"could\" (though does not have to) be achieved. For example, a voluntary exchange that creates pollution would be a \"Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement\" if the buyers and sellers are still willing to carry out the transaction even if they have to fully compensate the victims of the pollution. Kaldor\u2013Hicks does not require compensation actually be paid, merely that the possibility for compensation exists, and thus need not leave each at least as well off. Under Kaldor\u2013Hicks efficiency, an improvement can in fact leave some people worse off. Pareto-improvements require making every party involved better off (or at least none worse off).\nWhile every Pareto improvement is a Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement, most Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvements are not Pareto improvements. This is because the set of Pareto improvements is a proper subset of Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvements. This reflects the greater flexibility and applicability of the Kaldor\u2013Hicks criterion relative to the Pareto criterion."], "wikipedia-49648894": ["To obtain the optimal solution with minimum computation and time, the problem is solved iteratively where in each iteration the solution moves closer to the optimum solution.

However, the interest is sometimes in finding the optimal value for input variables in terms of the system outcomes. One way could be running simulation experiments for all possible input variables. However, this approach is not always practical due to several possible situations and it just makes it intractable to run experiments for each scenario. For example, there might be too many possible values for input variables, or the simulation model might be too complicated and expensive to run for suboptimal input variable values. In these cases, the goal is to find optimal values for the input variables rather than trying all possible values. This process is called simulation optimization.\n\nHeuristic methods change accuracy by speed. Their goal is to find a good solution faster than the traditional methods, when they are too slow or fail in solving the problem. Usually they find local optimal instead of the optimal value; however, the values are considered close enough of the final solution. Examples of this kind of method is tabu search or Genetic algorithm.\n\nMetamodels enable researchers to obtain reliable approximate model outputs without running expensive and time-consuming computer simulations.

Examples include analysis paralysis, cargo cult programming, death march, groupthink and vendor lock-in.\nSection::::Definition.\nAccording to the authors of \"Design Patterns\", there must be at least two key elements present to formally distinguish an actual anti-pattern from a simple bad habit, bad practice, or bad idea:\nBULLET::::1.

Determining what can be considered a theme can be used with deciding prevalence. This does not necessarily mean the frequency at which a theme occurs, but in terms of space within each data item and across the data set. It is ideal that the theme will occur numerous times across the data set, but a higher frequency does not necessarily mean that the theme is more important to understanding the data. A researcher's judgement is the key tool in determining which themes are more crucial. A potential data analysis pitfall occurs when researchers use the research question to code instead of creating codes and fail to provide adequate examples from the data. Eventually, themes need to provide an accurate understanding of the \"big picture\".\nThere are also different levels at which themes can be identified\u2014semantic and latent. A thematic analysis generally focuses wholly or mostly on one level. Semantic themes attempt to identify the explicit and surface meanings of the data. The researcher does not look beyond what the participant said or wrote. In this instance, the researcher wishes to give the reader a sense of the important themes. Thus, some depth and complexity is lost. However, a rich description of the \"entire\" data set is represented. Conversely, latent themes identify \"underlying\" ideas, patterns, and assumptions. This requires much interpretation of the data, so researchers might focus on one specific question or area of interest across the majority of the data set.\nA theme is different from a code. Several texts recommend that researchers \"code for themes\". This can be misleading because the theme is considered the outcome or result of coding, not that which is coded.

The pattern is characterized by a contracting range in prices coupled with an upward trend in prices (known as a rising wedge) or a downward trend in prices (known as a falling wedge).\nA wedge pattern is considered to be a pattern which is forming at the top or bottom of the trend. It is a type of formation in which trading activities are confined within converging straight lines which form a pattern. It should take about 3 to 4 weeks to complete the wedge. This pattern has a rising or falling slant pointing in the same direction. It differs from the triangle in the sense that both boundary lines either slope up or down. Price breaking out point creates another difference from the triangle. Falling and rising wedges are a small part of intermediate or major trend. As they are reserved for minor trends, they are not considered to be major patterns. Once that basic or primary trend resumes itself, the wedge pattern loses its effectiveness as a technical indicator.\nSection::::Falling wedge.\nThe falling wedge pattern is characterized by a chart pattern which forms when the market makes lower lows and lower highs with a contracting range. When this pattern is found in a downward trend, it is considered a reversal pattern, as the contraction of the range indicates the downtrend is losing steam. When this pattern is found in an uptrend, it is considered a bullish pattern, as the market range becomes narrower into the correction, indicating that the downward trend is losing strength and the resumption of the uptrend is in the making.\nIn a falling wedge, both boundary lines slant down from left to right. The upper descends at a steeper angle than the lower line. Volume keeps on diminishing and trading activity slows down due to narrowing prices. There comes the breaking point, and trading activity after the breakout differs. Once prices move out of the specific boundary lines of a falling wedge, they are more likely to move sideways and saucer-out before they resume the basic trend.\nSection::::Rising wedge.\nThe rising wedge pattern is characterized by a chart pattern which forms when the market makes higher highs and higher lows with a contracting range. When this pattern is found in an uptrend, it is considered a reversal pattern, as the contraction of the range indicates that the uptrend is losing strength. When this pattern is found in a downtrend, it is considered a bearish pattern, as the market range becomes narrower into the correction, indicating that the correction is losing strength, and that the resumption of the downtrend is in the making.\nIn a rising wedge, both boundary lines slant up from left to right. Although both lines point in the same direction, the lower line rises at a steeper angle than the upper one. Prices usually decline after breaking through the lower boundary line. As far as volumes are concerned, they keep on declining with each new price advance or wave up, indicating that the demand is weakening at the higher price level.

While it may not directly address the exact phrasing of the query, it can provide foundational knowledge about how increasing frequency can influence results, such as improving accuracy, resolution, or efficiency in certain systems.", "wikipedia-41700": ["It is known that in a statistical experiment such as tossing a fair coin and counting the occurrences of heads and tails, the numbers of heads and tails after a great many throws will differ by only a tiny percentage, while after only a few throws outcomes with a significant excess of heads over tails or vice versa are common; if an experiment with a few throws is repeated over and over, the outcomes will fluctuate a lot. It can be proven that the relative fluctuations reduce as the reciprocal square root of the number of throws, a result valid for all statistical fluctuations, including shot noise.\nThe magnitude of shot noise increases according to the square root of the expected number of events, such as the electric current or intensity of light. But since the strength of the signal itself increases more rapidly, the \"relative\" proportion of shot noise decreases and the signal to noise ratio (considering only shot noise) increases anyway. Thus shot noise is most frequently observed with small currents or low light intensities that have been amplified.\nWith very small currents and considering shorter time scales (thus wider bandwidths) shot noise can be significant. For instance, a microwave circuit operates on time scales of less than a nanosecond and if we were to have a current of 16 nanoamperes that would amount to only 100 electrons passing every nanosecond. According to Poisson statistics the \"actual\" number of electrons in any nanosecond would vary by 10 electrons rms, so that one sixth of the time less than 90 electrons would pass a point and one sixth of the time more than 110 electrons would be counted in a nanosecond. Now with this small current viewed on this time scale, the shot noise amounts to 1/10 of the DC current itself.\nWhile this is the result when the electrons contributing to the current occur completely randomly, unaffected by each other, there are important cases in which these natural fluctuations are largely suppressed due to a charge build up. Take the previous example in which an average of 100 electrons go from point A to point B every nanosecond. During the first half of a nanosecond we would expect 50 electrons to arrive at point B on the average, but in a particular half nanosecond there might well be 60 electrons which arrive there. This will create a more negative electric charge at point B than average, and that extra charge will tend to \"repel\" the further flow of electrons from leaving point A during the remaining half nanosecond. Thus the net current integrated over a nanosecond will tend more to stay near its average value of 100 electrons rather than exhibiting the expected fluctuations (10 electrons rms) we calculated."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Thus shot noise is most frequently observed with small currents or low light intensities that have been amplified.\n\nFor large numbers, the Poisson distribution approaches a normal distribution about its mean, and the elementary events (photons, electrons, etc.) are no longer individually observed, typically making shot noise in actual observations indistinguishable from true Gaussian noise. Since the standard deviation of shot noise is equal to the square root of the average number of events \"N\", the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is given by:\n\nThus when \"N\" is very large, the signal-to-noise ratio is very large as well, and any \"relative\" fluctuations in \"N\" due to other sources are more likely to dominate over shot noise.

This function may then be analyzed\u2014how does its value change over time\u2014or compared with other functions.\nFormally, the statement that \"value decreases over time\" is given by defining the linear differential operator formula_37 as:\nThis states that values decreases (\u2212) over time (\u2202) at the discount rate (\"r\"(\"t\")).

In terms of time value of money, the Green's function (for the time value ODE) is the value of a bond paying \u00a31 at a single point in time \"u\" \u2013 the value of any other stream of cash flows can then be obtained by taking combinations of this basic cash flow.

It is approximately equal to 2.71828, and is the limit of as approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest. It can also be calculated as the sum of the infinite series\nThe constant can be characterized in many different ways. For example, it can be defined as the unique positive number such that the graph of the function has unit slope at . The function is called the (natural) exponential function, and is the unique exponential function equal to its own derivative. The natural logarithm, or logarithm to base , is the inverse function to the natural exponential function. The natural logarithm of a number can be defined directly as the area under the curve between and , in which case is the value of \"k\" for which this area equals one (see image). There are alternative characterizations.\nThe number is of eminent importance in mathematics, alongside 0, 1,  and . All five of these numbers play important and recurring roles across mathematics, and are the five constants appearing in one formulation of Euler's identity. Like the constant , is irrational: it is not a ratio of integers. Also like , is transcendental: it is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients. The numerical value of truncated to 50 decimal places is\nIn mathematics, the standard is to typeset the constant as \"\", in italics; the ISO 80000-2:2009 standard recommends typesetting constants in an upright style, but this has not been validated by scientific community.\nJacob Bernoulli discovered this constant in 1683 by studying a question about compound interest:\nIf the interest is credited twice in the year, the interest rate for each 6 months will be 50%, so the initial $1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice, yielding at the end of the year. Compounding quarterly yields , and compounding monthly yields If there are compounding intervals, the interest for each interval will be and the value at the end of the year will be $1.00\u00d7.\nBernoulli noticed that this sequence approaches a limit (the force of interest) with larger and, thus, smaller compounding intervals. Compounding weekly () yields $2.692597\u2026, while compounding daily () yields $2.714567\u2026, just two cents more. The limit as grows large is the number that came to be known as ; with \"continuous\" compounding, the account value will reach $2.7182818...\nMore generally, an account that starts at $1 and offers an annual interest rate of will, after years, yield dollars with continuous compounding. (Here is the decimal equivalent of the rate of interest expressed as a percentage, so for 5% interest, .)\nThe number itself also has applications to probability theory, where it arises in a way not obviously related to exponential growth. Suppose that a gambler plays a slot machine that pays out with a probability of one in and plays it times. Then, for large (such as a million) the probability that the gambler will lose every bet is approximately . For it is already approximately 1/2.79.\nThis is an example of a Bernoulli trial process. Each time the gambler plays the slots, there is a one in one million chance of winning. Playing one million times is modelled by the binomial distribution, which is closely related to the binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle. The probability of winning times out of a million trials is:\nIn particular, the probability of winning zero times () is\nThis is very close to the limit\nThe normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation is known as the \"standard normal distribution\", given by the probability density function\nThe constraint of unit variance (and thus also unit standard deviation) results in the in the exponent, and the constraint of unit total area under the curve results in the factor formula_7. This function is symmetric around , where it attains its maximum value formula_7, and has inflection points at .\nAnother application of , also discovered in part by Jacob Bernoulli along with Pierre Raymond de Montmort, is in the problem of derangements, also known as the \"hat check problem\": guests are invited to a party, and at the door, the guests all check their hats with the butler, who in turn places the hats into boxes, each labelled with the name of one guest. But the butler has not asked the identities of the guests, and so he puts the hats into boxes selected at random. The problem of de Montmort is to find the probability that \"none\" of the hats gets put into the right box. The answer is:\nAs the number of guests tends to infinity, approaches . Furthermore, the number of ways the hats can be placed into the boxes so that none of the hats are in the right box is rounded to the nearest integer, for every positive\u00a0.\nA stick of length is broken into equal parts. The value of that maximizes the product of the lengths is then either\nThe stated result follows because the maximum value of formula_12 occurs at formula_13 (Steiner's problem, discussed below). The quantity formula_12 is a measure of information gleaned from an event occurring with probability formula_15, so that essentially the same optimal division appears in optimal planning problems like the secretary problem.\nThe number occurs naturally in connection with many problems involving asymptotics. An example is Stirling's formula for the asymptotics of the factorial function, in which both the numbers and  enter:\nAs a consequence,\nThe principal motivation for introducing the number , particularly in calculus, is to perform differential and integral calculus with exponential functions and logarithms. A general exponential has a derivative, given by a limit:\nThe parenthesized limit on the right is independent of the it depends only on the When the base is set this limit is equal and so is symbolically defined by the equation:\nConsequently, the exponential function with base is particularly suited to doing calculus. as opposed to some other number, as the base of the exponential function makes calculations involving the derivative much simpler.\nAnother motivation comes from considering the derivative of the base- logarithm, i.e., of for\u00a0:\nwhere the substitution was made. The -logarithm of is 1, if equals . So symbolically,\nThe logarithm with this special base is called the natural logarithm and is denoted as ; it behaves well under differentiation since there is no undetermined limit to carry through the calculations.\nThere are thus two ways in which to select such special numbers . One way is to set the derivative of the exponential function equal to , and solve for . The other way is to set the derivative of the base logarithm to and solve for . In each case, one arrives at a convenient choice of base for doing calculus. It turns out that these two solutions for are actually \"the same\", the number .\nOther characterizations of are also possible: one is as the limit of a sequence, another is as the sum of an infinite series, and still others rely on integral calculus. So far, the following two (equivalent) properties have been introduced:\nBULLET::::1. The number is the unique positive real number such that formula_22.\nBULLET::::2. The number is the unique positive real number such that formula_23.\nThe following four characterizations can be proven equivalent:\n/math\nwhere is the factorial of .\nAs in the motivation, the exponential function is important in part because it is the unique nontrivial function (up to multiplication by a constant) which is its own derivative\nand therefore its own antiderivative as well:\nThe number is the unique real number such that\nfor all positive .\nAlso, we have the inequality\nfor all real , with equality if and only if .

The concept gained greater exposure when they collaborated with popular author Terry Pratchett, discussing \"lies-to-children\" in the book \"The Science of Discworld\" (1999).\n\nCohen and Stewart discussed \"lies-to-children\" and the desire inherent in society for a view of simplicity with regards to complex concepts in their 1994 book \"The Collapse of Chaos\".\n\nStewart and Cohen wrote in \"Figments of Reality\" (1997) that the lie-to-children concept reflected the difficulty inherent in reducing complex concepts during the education process. Stewart and Cohen noted reality itself was viewed within the prism of human perspective: \"Any description suitable for human minds to grasp must be \"some\" type of lie-to-children \u2014 real reality is always much too complicated for our limited minds.\"\n\nLibrarian and editor Andrew Sawyer discussed the \"lie-to-children\" concept introduced by scientists Cohen and Stewart in their early two non-fiction books. Sawyer wrote: \"In \"The Collapse of Chaos\" and \"Figments of Reality\", we also come across the concept of 'lies-to-children' \u2014 the necessarily simplified stories we tell children and students as a foundation for understanding so that eventually they can discover that they are not, in fact, \"true\".\"\n\nThe definition given in \"The Science of Discworld\" (1999) is as follows: \"A lie-to-children is a statement that is false, but which nevertheless leads the child's mind towards a more accurate explanation, one that the child will only be able to appreciate if it has been primed with the lie\". The authors acknowledge that some people might dispute the applicability of the term \"lie\", while defending it on the grounds that \"it is for the best possible reasons, but it is still a lie\". This viewpoint is derived from earlier perspectives within the field of philosophy of science.\n\nIn a 1999 interview, Pratchett commented upon the phrase: \"I \"like\" the lies-to-children motif, because it underlies the way we run our society and resonates nicely with Discworld.\" He was critical of problems inherent in early education: \"You arrive with your sparkling A-levels all agleam, and the first job of the tutors is to reveal that what you thought was true is only true for a given value of 'truth'.\" Pratchett cautioned: \"Most of us need just 'enough' knowledge of the sciences, and it's delivered to us in metaphors and analogies that bite us in the bum if we think they're the same as the truth.\"\n\nCohen and Stewart further elaborated upon the lie-to-children trope in a 2002 book they coauthored on exobiology, \"Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life\". Within the work, the authors were critical of use of lie-to-children as an educational methodology which had an unfortunate side-effect of reducing complex science concepts to overly simplified explanations. Stewart was asked in a 2015 interview about his views on Pratchett beyond the influence of lie-to-children, and the author's take on the understanding of science. Stewart commented upon the interaction between himself and Cohen with Pratchett during the writing process: \"Terry wasn't trained as a scientist, but he had the right kind of critical attitude. He was extraordinarily widely read, and would ask all sorts of unexpected questions that really got me and Jack thinking.\""]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-980207": 1, "wikipedia-799398": 1, "wikipedia-10103051": 2, "wikipedia-11517229": 1, "wikipedia-708399": 1, "wikipedia-42526076": 1, "wikipedia-18894210": 1, "wikipedia-549355": 1, "wikipedia-45283122": 1, "wikipedia-38860223": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-980207": 2, "wikipedia-799398": 2, "wikipedia-10103051": 3, "wikipedia-11517229": 1, "wikipedia-708399": 2, "wikipedia-42526076": 1, "wikipedia-18894210": 1, "wikipedia-549355": 2, "wikipedia-45283122": 1, "wikipedia-38860223": 1}}}

The constant also has applications to probability theory, where it arises in a way not obviously related to exponential growth. Suppose a slot machine with a one in probability of winning is played times. Then, for large (such as one million) the probability that nothing will be won is approximately and tends to this value as tends to infinity.\nAnother application of , discovered in part by Jacob Bernoulli along with French mathematician Pierre Raymond de Montmort, is in the problem of derangements, also known as the \"hat check problem\". Here guests are invited to a party, and at the door each guest checks his hat with the butler who then places them into labelled boxes. The butler does not know the name of the guests, and so must put them into boxes selected at random. The problem of de Montmort is: what is the probability that \"none\" of the hats gets put into the right box. The answer is\nand as tends to infinity, approaches .\nThe numeric value of is approximately 2.7182818284 ."], "wikipedia-41302121": ["A mathematical constant is a number whose value is fixed by an unambiguous definition, often referred to by a symbol or by mathematicians' names to facilitate using it across multiple mathematical problems.

This formula is provided using the financial function PMT in a spreadsheet such as Excel. In the example, the monthly payment is obtained by entering either of these formulas:\nThe following derivation of this formula illustrates how fixed-rate mortgage loans work. The amount owed on the loan at the end of every month equals the amount owed from the previous month, plus the interest on this amount, minus the fixed amount paid every month. This fact results in the debt schedule:\nThe polynomial formula_10 appearing before the fixed monthly payment \"c\" (with formula_11) is a geometric series, which has a simple closed-form expression obtained from observing that formula_12 because all but the first and last terms in this difference cancel each other out. Therefore, solving for formula_13 yields the much simpler closed-form expression\nApplying this formula to the amount owed at the end of the \"N\"th month gives (using formula_15 to succinctly denote the function value formula_13 at argument value \"x\" = (1+\"r\" )):\nThe amount of the monthly payment at the end of month \"N\" that is applied to principal paydown equals the amount \"c\" of payment minus the amount of interest currently paid on the pre-existing unpaid principal. The latter amount, the interest component of the current payment, is the interest rate \"r\" times the amount unpaid at the end of month \"N\"\u20131. Since in the early years of the mortgage the unpaid principal is still large, so are the interest payments on it; so the portion of the monthly payment going toward paying down the principal is very small and equity in the property accumulates very slowly (in the absence of changes in the market value of the property). But in the later years of the mortgage, when the principal has already been substantially paid down and not much monthly interest needs to be paid, most of the monthly payment goes toward repayment of the principal, and the remaining principal declines rapidly.\nThe borrower's equity in the property equals the current market value of the property minus the amount owed according to the above formula.\nWith a fixed rate mortgage, the borrower agrees to pay off the loan completely at the end of the loan's term, so the amount owed at month \"N\" must be zero. For this to happen, the monthly payment \"c\" can be obtained from the previous equation to obtain:\nwhich is the formula originally provided.

The frequency interest is compounded.\n\nTo convert an interest rate from one compounding basis to another compounding basis, use\nwhere\n\"r\" is the interest rate with compounding frequency \"n\", and\n\"r\" is the interest rate with compounding frequency \"n\".\n\nWhen interest is continuously compounded, use\nwhere\n\"formula_14\" is the interest rate on a continuous compounding basis, and\n\"r\" is the stated interest rate with a compounding frequency \"n\"."], "wikipedia-4962611": ["Although designed for monthly use, a daily calculation over the same period can be made, converting the periods to 294-day and 231-day rate of changes, and a 210-day weighted moving average.\nJerry Samet has successfully used the Coppock indicator using weekly close data vs. monthly close. This indicator greatly helps with the definition of the intermediate term market moves of 6-weeks to 12-month duration."], "wikipedia-3046012": ["The general conversion factor for APR to EAR is formula_1, where formula_2 represents the number of compounding periods of the APR per EAR period.\nFor a common credit card quoted at 12.99% APR compounded daily, the one-year EAR is formula_3, or 13.87%; and if it is compounded monthly, the one-year EAR is formula_4 or 13.79%. On an annual basis, the one-year EAR for compounding monthly is always less than the EAR for compounding daily. However, the relationship of the two in individual billing periods depends on the APR and the number of days in the billing period.\nFor example, given 12 billing periods a year, 365 days, and an APR of 12.99%, if a billing period is 28 days then the rate charged by monthly compounding is greater than that charged by daily compounding (formula_5 is greater than formula_6). But for a billing period of 31 days, the order is reversed (formula_5 is less than formula_8).\nIn general, credit cards available to middle-class cardholders that range in credit limit from $1,000 to $30,000 calculate the finance charge by methods that are exactly equal to compound interest compounded daily, although the interest is not posted to the account until the end of the billing cycle. A high U.S. APR of 29.99% carries an effective annual rate of 34.96% for daily compounding and 34.48% for monthly compounding, given a year with 12 billing periods and 365 days."], "wikipedia-526293": ["The effective interest rate (EIR), effective annual interest rate, annual equivalent rate (AER) or simply effective rate is the interest rate on a loan or financial product restated from the nominal interest rate as an interest rate with annual compound interest payable in arrears.\nIt is used to compare the annual interest between loans with different compounding periods like week, month, year, etc. The effective interest rate differs in one important respect from the annual percentage rate (APR): the APR method converts this weekly or monthly interest rate into what would be called an annual rate that doesn\u2019t take into account the effect of compounding.  \nBy contrast, in the EIR, the periodic rate is annualized using compounding. It is the standard in the European Union and a large number of countries around the world.\nThe EIR is more precise in financial terms, taking into consideration the effects of compounding, i.e. the fact that for each period, interest is not calculated on the principal, but on the amount of the previous period, including capital and interest.  This reasoning is easily understandable when looking at savings: interest is capitalized every month, and every month the saver earns interest on the interest from the previous period. As an effect of compounding, the interest earned over a year represent 26.82% of the initial amount, instead of 24%, the monthly 2% interest rate simply multiplied by 12. If we consider borrowings instead of savings, the compounded interest rate reflects the opportunity cost for the borrower not to be able to invest the interest he pays to the lender into an asset generating the same percentage of return. \nThe term nominal EIR or nominal APR can be used to refer to an annualized rate that does not take into account front-fees and other costs can be included. \nAnnual percentage yield or effective annual yield is the analogous concept used for savings or investment products, such as a certificate of deposit. Since any loan is an investment product for the lender, the terms may be used to apply to the same transaction, depending on the point of view.\nEffective annual interest or yield may be calculated or applied differently depending on the circumstances, and the definition should be studied carefully. For example, a bank may refer to the yield on a loan portfolio after expected losses as its effective yield and include income from other fees, meaning that the interest paid by each borrower may differ substantially from the bank's effective yield.\nSection::::Calculation.\nThe effective interest rate is calculated as if compounded annually. The effective rate is calculated in the following way, where \"r\" is the effective annual rate, \"i\" the nominal rate, and \"n\" the number of compounding periods per year (for example, 12 for monthly compounding):\nFor example, a nominal interest rate of 6% compounded monthly is equivalent to an effective interest rate of 6.17%. 6% compounded monthly is credited as 6%/12 = 0.005 every month. After one year, the initial capital is increased by the factor (1 + 0.005) \u2248 1.0617.\nWhen the frequency of compounding is increased up to infinity the calculation will be:\nThe yield depends on the frequency of compounding:\nThe effective interest rate is a special case of the internal rate of return.\nIf the monthly interest rate j is known and remains constant throughout the year, the effective annual rate can be calculated as follows:\nThe annual percentage rate (APR) is calculated in the following way, where i is the interest rate for the period and n is the number of periods.\n\"APR = i x n\""]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-334320": 1, "wikipedia-434428": 2, "wikipedia-1867864": 1, "wikipedia-4962611": 1, "wikipedia-7094957": 1, "wikipedia-3046012": 1, "wikipedia-857766": 1, "wikipedia-36916458": 1, "wikipedia-3426224": 1, "wikipedia-526293": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-334320": 1, "wikipedia-434428": 3, "wikipedia-1867864": 1, "wikipedia-4962611": 2, "wikipedia-7094957": 1, "wikipedia-3046012": 2, "wikipedia-857766": 1, "wikipedia-36916458": 1, "wikipedia-3426224": 1, "wikipedia-526293": 2}}}

This definition of implicitly makes use of flat (Euclidean) geometry; although the notion of a circle can be extended to any curved (non-Euclidean) geometry, these new circles will no longer satisfy the formula .\nHere, the circumference of a circle is the arc length around the perimeter of the circle, a quantity which can be formally defined independently of geometry using limits, a concept in calculus.

One such definition, due to Richard Baltzer, and popularized by Edmund Landau, is the following: is twice the smallest positive number at which the cosine function equals 0.

First of all, Euler introduced the concept of a function, and introduced the use of the exponential function and logarithms in analytic proofs\nEuler frequently used the logarithmic functions as a tool in analysis problems, and discovered new ways by which they could be used. He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions in terms of power series, and successfully defined logarithms for complex and negative numbers, thus greatly expanding the scope where logarithms could be applied in mathematics. Most researchers in the field long held the view that formula_7 for any positive real formula_8 since by using the additivity property of logarithms formula_9. In a 1747 letter to Jean Le Rond d'Alembert, Euler defined the natural logarithm of \u22121 as formula_10 a pure imaginary.\nEuler is well known in analysis for his frequent use and development of power series: that is, the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms, such as\nNotably, Euler discovered the power series expansions for \"e\" and the inverse tangent function \nHis use of power series enabled him to solve the famous Basel problem in 1735:\nIn addition, Euler elaborated the theory of higher transcendental functions by introducing the gamma function and introduced a new method for solving quartic equations. He also found a way to calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of complex analysis. Euler invented the calculus of variations including its most well-known result, the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation.\nEuler also pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory.

For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's work in this area led to the development of the prime number theorem.\n\nEuler's great interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of his friend in the St. Peterburg Academy, Christian Goldbach. A lot of his early work on number theory was based on the works of Pierre de Fermat, and developed some of Fermat's ideas.\nOne focus of Euler's work was to link the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis. He proved that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges. In doing so, he discovered a connection between Riemann zeta function and prime numbers, known as the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function.\nEuler proved Newton's identities, Fermat's little theorem, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, and made distinct contributions to the Lagrange's four-square theorem. He also invented the totient function \u03c6(n) which assigns to a positive integer n the number of positive integers less than n and coprime to n. Using properties of this function he was able to generalize Fermat's little theorem to what would become known as Euler's theorem. He further contributed significantly to the understanding of perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. Euler made progress toward the prime number theorem and conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The two concepts are regarded as the fundamental theorems of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for Carl Friedrich Gauss.\n\nIn 1736 Euler solved, or rather proved unsolvable, a problem known as the seven bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg. The city of K\u00f6nigsberg, Kingdom of Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) is set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands which were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The question is whether it is possible to walk with a route that crosses each bridge exactly once, and return to the starting point.\nEuler's solution of the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory. In addition, his recognition that the key information was the number of bridges and the list of their endpoints (rather than their exact positions) presaged the development of topology.\nEuler also made contributions to the understanding of planar graphs. He introduced a formula governing the relationship between the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a convex polyhedron. Given such a polyhedron, the alternating sum of vertices, edges and faces equals a constant: \"V\" \u2212 \"E\" + \"F\" = 2. This constant, \u03c7, is the Euler characteristic of the plane. The study and generalization of this equation, specially by Cauchy and Lhuillier, is at the origin of topology. Euler characteristic, which may be generalized to any topological space as the alternating sum of the Betti numbers, naturally arises from homology. In particular, it is equal to 2 \u2212 2\"g\" for a closed oriented surface with genus \"g\" and to 2 \u2212 \"k\" for a non-orientable surface with k crosscaps. This property led to the definition of rotation systems in topological graph theory.\n\nSome of Euler's greatest successes were in applying analytic methods to real world problems, describing numerous applications of Bernoulli's numbers, Fourier series, Venn diagrams, Euler numbers, e and \u03c0 constants, continued fractions and integrals. He integrated Leibniz's differential calculus with Newton's Method of Fluxions, and developed tools that made it easier to apply calculus to physical problems. In particular, he made great strides in improving numerical approximation of integrals, inventing what are now known as the \"Euler approximations\". The most notable of these approximations are Euler method and the Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula. He also facilitated the use of differential equations, in particular introducing the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant: \nOne of Euler's more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in music. In 1739 he wrote the \"Tentamen novae theoriae musicae,\" hoping to eventually integrate music theory as part of mathematics.

He is a seminal figure in the history of mathematics; if printed, his works, many of which are of fundamental interest, would occupy between 60 and 80 quarto volumes. Euler's name is associated with a large number of topics.\nEuler is the only mathematician to have \"two\" numbers named after him: the important Euler's number in calculus, \"e\", approximately equal to 2.71828, and the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant \u03b3 (gamma) sometimes referred to as just \"Euler's constant\", approximately equal to 0.57721. It is not known whether \u03b3 is rational or irrational.\nEuler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and widely circulated textbooks. Most notably, he introduced the concept of a function and was the first to write \"f\"(\"x\") to denote the function \"f\" applied to the argument \"x\". He also introduced the modern notation for the trigonometric functions, the letter for the base of the natural logarithm (now also known as Euler's number), the Greek letter \u03a3 for summations and the letter to denote the imaginary unit. The use of the Greek letter \"\u03c0\" to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was also popularized by Euler, although it originated with Welsh mathematician William Jones.\nThe development of infinitesimal calculus was at the forefront of 18th-century mathematical research, and the Bernoullis\u2014family friends of Euler\u2014were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of mathematical rigour (in particular his reliance on the principle of the generality of algebra), his ideas led to many great advances.\nEuler is well known in analysis for his frequent use and development of power series, the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms, such as\nNotably, Euler directly proved the power series expansions for and the inverse tangent function. (Indirect proof via the inverse power series technique was given by Newton and Leibniz between 1670 and 1680.) His daring use of power series enabled him to solve the famous Basel problem in 1735 (he provided a more elaborate argument in 1741):\nEuler introduced the use of the exponential function and logarithms in analytic proofs. He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions using power series, and he successfully defined logarithms for negative and complex numbers, thus greatly expanding the scope of mathematical applications of logarithms. He also defined the exponential function for complex numbers, and discovered its relation to the trigonometric functions. For any real number  (taken to be radians), Euler's formula states that the complex exponential function satisfies\nA special case of the above formula is known as Euler's identity,\ncalled \"the most remarkable formula in mathematics\" by Richard P. Feynman, for its single uses of the notions of addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and equality, and the single uses of the important constants 0, 1, , and . In 1988, readers of the \"Mathematical Intelligencer\" voted it \"the Most Beautiful Mathematical Formula Ever\". In total, Euler was responsible for three of the top five formulae in that poll.\nDe Moivre's formula is a direct consequence of Euler's formula.\nIn addition, Euler elaborated the theory of higher transcendental functions by introducing the gamma function and introduced a new method for solving quartic equations. He also found a way to calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of modern complex analysis. He also invented the calculus of variations including its best-known result, the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation.\nEuler also pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's work in this area led to the development of the prime number theorem.\nEuler's interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of Christian Goldbach, his friend in the St. Petersburg Academy. A lot of Euler's early work on number theory was based on the works of Pierre de Fermat. Euler developed some of Fermat's ideas and disproved some of his conjectures.\nEuler linked the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis. He proved that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges. In doing so, he discovered the connection between the Riemann zeta function and the prime numbers; this is known as the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function.\nEuler proved Newton's identities, Fermat's little theorem, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, and he made distinct contributions to Lagrange's four-square theorem. He also invented the totient function \u03c6(\"n\"), the number of positive integers less than or equal to the integer \"n\" that are coprime to \"n\". Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem to what is now known as Euler's theorem. He contributed significantly to the theory of perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. He proved that the relationship shown between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes earlier proved by Euclid was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the Euclid\u2013Euler theorem. Euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss.\nBy 1772 Euler had proved that 2\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 = 2,147,483,647 is a Mersenne prime. It may have remained the largest known prime until 1867.\nIn 1735, Euler presented a solution to the problem known as the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg. The city of K\u00f6nigsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.\nEuler also discovered the formula formula_5 relating the number of vertices, edges and faces of a convex polyhedron, and hence of a planar graph. The constant in this formula is now known as the Euler characteristic for the graph (or other mathematical object), and is related to the genus of the object. The study and generalization of this formula, specifically by Cauchy and L'Huilier, is at the origin of topology."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-7079444": 1, "wikipedia-17902": 2, "wikipedia-2427526": 1, "wikipedia-18753256": 1, "wikipedia-3990379": 1, "wikipedia-13200719": 1, "wikipedia-27710879": 1, "wikipedia-30780454": 1, "wikipedia-18635044": 1, "wikipedia-7859273": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-7079444": 2, "wikipedia-17902": 3, "wikipedia-2427526": 1, "wikipedia-18753256": 1, "wikipedia-3990379": 1, "wikipedia-13200719": 1, "wikipedia-27710879": 1, "wikipedia-30780454": 1, "wikipedia-18635044": 1, "wikipedia-7859273": 1}}}

In contrast, the exponential distribution describes the time for a continuous process to change state.\nIn real-world scenarios, the assumption of a constant rate (or probability per unit time) is rarely satisfied. For example, the rate of incoming phone calls differs according to the time of day. But if we focus on a time interval during which the rate is roughly constant, such as from 2 to 4 p.m. during work days, the exponential distribution can be used as a good approximate model for the time until the next phone call arrives. Similar caveats apply to the following examples which yield approximately exponentially distributed variables:\nBULLET::::- The time until a radioactive particle decays, or the time between clicks of a Geiger counter\nBULLET::::- The time it takes before your next telephone call\nBULLET::::- The time until default (on payment to company debt holders) in reduced form credit risk modeling\nExponential variables can also be used to model situations where certain events occur with a constant probability per unit length, such as the distance between mutations on a DNA strand, or between roadkills on a given road.\nIn queuing theory, the service times of agents in a system (e.g. how long it takes for a bank teller etc. to serve a customer) are often modeled as exponentially distributed variables. (The arrival of customers for instance is also modeled by the Poisson distribution if the arrivals are independent and distributed identically.) The length of a process that can be thought of as a sequence of several independent tasks follows the Erlang distribution (which is the distribution of the sum of several independent exponentially distributed variables).\nReliability theory and reliability engineering also make extensive use of the exponential distribution. Because of the \"memoryless\" property of this distribution, it is well-suited to model the constant hazard rate portion of the bathtub curve used in reliability theory. It is also very convenient because it is so easy to add failure rates in a reliability model. The exponential distribution is however not appropriate to model the overall lifetime of organisms or technical devices, because the \"failure rates\" here are not constant: more failures occur for very young and for very old systems.\nIn physics, if you observe a gas at a fixed temperature and pressure in a uniform gravitational field, the heights of the various molecules also follow an approximate exponential distribution, known as the Barometric formula.

Sometimes the ratio is expressed as a quotient (\"rise over run\"), giving the same number for every two distinct points on the same line. A line that is decreasing has a negative \"rise\". The line may be practical - as set by a road surveyor, or in a diagram that models a road or a roof either as a description or as a plan.\n\nThe \"steepness\", incline, or grade of a line is measured by the absolute value of the slope. A slope with a greater absolute value indicates a steeper line. The \"direction\" of a line is either increasing, decreasing, horizontal or vertical. \nBULLET::::- A line is increasing if it goes up from left to right. The slope is positive, i.e. formula_1.\nBULLET::::- A line is decreasing if it goes down from left to right.

This is a constant function.\nBULLET::::- If a line is vertical the slope is \"undefined\" (see below).\n\nThe rise of a road between two points is the difference between the altitude of the road at those two points, say \"y\" and \"y\", or in other words, the rise is (\"y\" \u2212 \"y\") = \u0394\"y\". For relatively short distances - where the earth's curvature may be neglected, the run is the difference in distance from a fixed point measured along a level, horizontal line, or in other words, the run is (\"x\" \u2212 \"x\") = \u0394\"x\". Here the slope of the road between the two points is simply described as the ratio of the altitude change to the horizontal distance between any two points on the line.\n\nIn mathematical language, the slope \"m\" of the line is\nThe concept of slope applies directly to grades or gradients in geography and civil engineering. Through trigonometry, the slope \"m\" of a line is related to its angle of incline \"\u03b8\" by the tangent function\nThus, a 45\u00b0 rising line has a slope of +1 and a 45\u00b0 falling line has a slope of \u22121.\n\nAs a generalization of this practical description, the mathematics of differential calculus defines the slope of a curve at a point as the slope of the tangent line at that point. When the curve is given by a series of points in a diagram or in a list of the coordinates of points, the slope may be calculated not at a point but between any two given points. When the curve is given as a continuous function, perhaps as an algebraic formula, then the differential calculus provides rules giving a formula for the slope of the curve at any point in the middle of the curve.\n\nThis generalization of the concept of slope allows very complex constructions to be planned and built that go well beyond static structures that are either horizontals or verticals, but can change in time, move in curves, and change depending on the rate of change of other factors.
