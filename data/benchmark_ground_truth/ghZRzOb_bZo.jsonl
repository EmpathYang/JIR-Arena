First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point.

Assuming that the current estimate of the parameters is\n$\\theta^{(n)}$, our goal is to find another $\\theta^{(n+1)}$ that can improve\nthe likelihood $L(\\theta)$.\nLet us consider the difference between the likelihood at a potentially better\nparameter value $\\theta$ and the likelihood at the current estimate\n$\\theta^{(n)}$, and relate it with the corresponding difference in the complete\nlikelihood:\nOur goal is to maximize $L(\\theta)-L(\\theta^{(n)})$, which is equivalent to\nmaximizing $L(\\theta)$. Now take the expectation of this equation w.r.t. the\nconditional distribution of the hidden variable given the data $X$ and the\ncurrent estimate of parameters $\\theta^{(n)}$, i.e., $p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)}$. We\nhave\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nL(\\theta) - L(\\theta^{(n)} ) & = & \\sum_{H} L_c(\\theta)p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)}) -\n    \\sum_{H} L_c(\\theta^{(n)} )p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)}) \\\\\n    &+& \\sum_H p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)}) \\log \\frac{ p(\n    H|X,\\theta^{(n)})}{p(H|X,\\theta)}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nNote that the left side of the equation remains the same as the variable $H$\ndoes not occur there. The last term can be recognized as the KL-divergence of\n$p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)})$ and $p(H|X,\\theta)$,\nwhich is always non-negative. We thus have\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nL(\\theta) - L(\\theta^{(n)} ) & \\geq & \\sum_{H} L_c(\\theta)p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)}) - \\sum_{H} L_c(\\theta^{(n)} )p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)})\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nor\nWe thus obtain a lower bound for the original likelihood function. The main idea\nof EM is to maximize this lower bound so as to maximize the original\n(incomplete) likelihood.

The obvious choice would be the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) that we have seen before in chapter~\\ref{chap:background}. In MLE, we normalize the word frequencies in the document by the document length. Thus, all the words that have the same frequency count will have an equal probability under this estimation method.\nNote that words that have not occurred in the document will have zero probability. In other words, we assume the user will sample a word from the document to formulate the query, and there is no chance of sampling any word that is not in the document. But we know that's not good, so how would we improve this? In order to assign a non-zero probability to words that have not been observed in the document, we would have to take away some probability mass from seen words because we need some extra probability mass for the unseen words---otherwise, they won't sum to one.\nTo make this transformation and to improve the MLE, we will assign nonzero probabilities to words that are not observed in the data.

There are potentially many different ways to do this, but here we introduce a general way of solving this problem called a generative model. This is, in fact, a very general idea and a principled way of using statistical modeling to solve text mining problems. The basic idea of this approach is to first design a generative model for our data, \\ie, a probabilistic model to model how the data are generated, or a model that can allow us to compute the probability of how likely we will observe the data we have. The actual data aren't necessarily (indeed often unlikely) generated this way, but by assuming the data to be generated in a particular way according to a particular model, we can have a formal way to characterize our data which further facilitates topic discovery. In general, our model will have some parameters (which can be denoted by $\\Lambda$); they control the behavior of the model by controlling what kind of data would have high (or low) probabilities. If you set these parameters to different values, the model would behave differently; that is, it would tend to give different data points high (or low) probabilities. We design the model in such a way that its parameters would encode the knowledge we would like to discover. Then, we attempt to estimate these parameters based on the data (or infer the values of parameters based on the observed data) so as to generate the desired output in the form of parameter values, which we have designed to denote the knowledge we would like to discover.", "The $y$ axis shows the probability of the data.

These estimator parameters will then become the output of the mining hours, which means we'll take the estimating parameters as the knowledge that we discover from the text.\n\nNow what does a likelihood function look like? Well, this is just the probability of generating this whole document, that given such a model. Because we assume the independence in generating each word so the probability of the document will be just a product of the probability of each word. And since some word might have repeated occurrences. So we can also rewrite this product in a different form. So in this line, we have rewritten the formula into a product over all the unique words in the vocabulary, w sub 1 through w sub M. Now this is different from the previous line. Well, the product is over different positions of words in the document. Now when we do this transformation, we then would need to introduce a counter function here. This denotes the count of word one in document and similarly this is the count of words of n in the document because these words might have repeated occurrences. You can also see if a word did not occur in the document. It will have a zero count, therefore that corresponding term will disappear. So this is a very useful form of writing down the likelihood function that we will often use later. So I want you to pay attention to this, just get familiar with this notation. It's just to change the product over all the different words in the vocabulary. So in the end, of course, we'll use theta sub i to express this likelihood function and it would look like this.\n\nNext, we're going to find the theta values or probabilities of these words that would maximize this likelihood function.", "our goal is to maximize this likelihood function. We will find it often easy to maximize the local likelihood instead of the original likelihood. And this is purely for mathematical convenience because after the logarithm transformation our function will becomes a sum instead of product. And we also have constraints over these these probabilities. The sum makes it easier to take derivative, which is often needed for finding the optimal solution of this function. Now at this point the problem is purely a mathematical problem because we are going to just the find the optimal solution of a constrained maximization problem. The objective function is the likelihood function and the constraint is that all these probabilities must sum to one. Now, the idea of this approach is just to turn the constraint optimization into, in some sense, an unconstrained optimizing problem. Now we are just interested in optimizing this Lagrange function. As you may recall from calculus, an optimal point would be achieved when the derivative is set to zero. This is a necessary condition. It's not sufficient, though. So if we do that you will see the partial derivative, with respect to theta i here ,is equal to this. And this part comes from the derivative of the logarithm function and this lambda is simply taken from here. And when we set it to zero we can easily see theta sub i is related to lambda in this way. Since we know all the theta i's must a sum to one we can plug this into this constraint, here. And this will allow us to solve for lambda. And this further allows us to then solve the optimization problem, eventually, to find the optimal setting for theta sub i. And if you look at this formula it turns out that it's actually very intuitive because this is just the normalized count of these words by the document ns, which is also a sum of all the counts of words in the document. So, after all this mess, after all, we have just obtained something that's very intuitive and this will be just our intuition where we want to maximize the data by assigning as much probability mass as possible to all the observed the words here. And you might also notice that this is the general result of maximum likelihood raised estimator. In general, the estimator would be to normalize counts and it's just sometimes the counts have to be done in a particular way, as you will also see later.", "And the maximum likelihood estimator is, as usual, just to find the parameters that would maximize the likelihood function.

Under most circumstances, however, numerical methods will be necessary to find the maximum of the likelihood function.\nFrom the point of view of Bayesian inference, MLE is a special case of maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) that assumes a uniform prior distribution of the parameters. In frequentist inference, MLE is a special case of an extremum estimator, with the objective function being the likelihood.\nSection::::Principles.\nFrom a statistical standpoint, the observations formula_1 are a random sample from an unknown population. The goal is to make inferences about the population that is most likely to have generated the sample, specifically the probability distribution corresponding to the population. Associated with each probability distribution is a unique vector formula_2 of parameters that index the probability distribution within a parametric family formula_3. As formula_4 changes in value, different probability distributions are generated. The idea of maximum likelihood is to re-express the joint probability of the sample data formula_5 as a likelihood function formula_6 that treats formula_4 as a variable. For independent and identically distributed random variables, the likelihood function is defined as\nand evaluated at the observed data sample.

It refers to any algorithm which produces a solution having the fewest possible moves, the idea being that an omniscient being would know an optimal step from any given configuration.\n\nThe notion applies to puzzles that can assume a finite number of \"configurations\", with a relatively small, well-defined arsenal of \"moves\" that may be applicable to configurations and then lead to a new configuration. Solving the puzzle means to reach a designated \"final configuration\", a singular configuration, or one of a collection of configurations. To solve the puzzle a sequence of moves is applied, starting from some arbitrary initial configuration.\n\nAn algorithm can be considered to solve such a puzzle if it takes as input an arbitrary initial configuration and produces as output a sequence of moves leading to a final configuration (\"if\" the puzzle is solvable from that initial configuration, otherwise it signals the impossibility of a solution). A solution is optimal if the sequence of moves is as short as possible. This count is known as God's number, or, more formally, the minimax value. God's algorithm, then, for a given puzzle, is an algorithm that solves the puzzle and produces only optimal solutions.\n\nSome writers, such as David Joyner, consider that for an algorithm to be properly referred to as \"God's algorithm\", it should also be \"practical\", meaning that the algorithm does not require extraordinary amounts of memory or time. For example, using a giant lookup table indexed by initial configurations would allow solutions to be found very quickly, but would require an extraordinary amount of memory.\n\nInstead of asking for a full solution, one can equivalently ask for a single move from an initial but not final configuration, where the move is the first of some optimal solution. An algorithm for the single-move version of the problem can be turned into an algorithm for the original problem by invoking it repeatedly while applying each move reported to the present configuration, until a final one is reached. Conversely, any algorithm for the original problem can be turned into an algorithm for the single-move version by truncating its output to its first move."], "wikipedia-3212380": ["The Momel algorithm attempts to solve this problem by factoring the raw curves into two components:\nBULLET::::- a \"macromelodic component\" - modelled as a quadratic spline function .

In this lecture, we're going to continue the discussion of probabilistic topic models. In particular, we're going to introduce the EM algorithm. Which is a family of useful algorithms for computing the maximum life or estimate of mixture models. So, this is now a familiar scenario of using two components, the mixture model to try to fact out the background words from one topic or word distribution. Yeah. So, we're interested in computing this estimate and we're going to try to adjust these probability values to maximize the probability of the observed documents. And know that we're assumed all the other parameters are known. So, the only thing unknown is these water properties, this given by zero something. And in this lecture, we're going to look into how to compute this maximum like or estimate. Now this started with the idea of separating the words in the text data into two groups. One group will be explained by the background model. The other group will be explained by the unknown topical order. After all this is the basic idea of the mixture model. But, suppose we actually know which word is from which distribution. So that would mean, for example, these words, the, is, and we, are known to be from this background origin, distribution. On the other hand, the other words, text mining, clustering, etcetera are known to be from the topic word, distribution as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-known-dist}. If you can see the color, that these are showing blue. These blue words are, they are assumed to be from the topic word, distribution. If we already know how to separate these words. Then the problem of estimating the word distribution would be extremely simple, right? If you think about this for a moment, you'll realize that, well, we can simply take all these words that are known to be from this word distribution, see that's a d and normalize them. So indeed this problem would be very easy to solve if we had known which words are from which it is written precisely. And this is in fact, making this model no longer a mystery model because we can already observe which of these distribution has been used to generate which part of the data. So we, actually go back to the single order distribution problem. And in this case, let's call these words that are known to be from theta d, a pseudo document of d prime. And now all we have to do is just normalize these word accounts for each word, w sub i. And that's fairly straightforward, and it's just dictated by the maximum estimator. Now, this idea, however, doesn't work because we in practice, don't really know which word is from which distribution. But this gives us an idea of perhaps we can guess which word is from which distribution. Specifically, given all the parameters, can we infer the distribution a word is from? So let's assume that we actually know tentative probabilities for these words in theta sub d. So now all the parameters are known for this mystery model as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-infer}. Now let's consider word, like a text. So the question is, do you think text is more likely, having been generated from theta sub d or from theta sub b? So, in other words, we are to infer which distribution has been used to generate this text. Now, this inference process is a typical of basing an inference situation, where we have some prior about these two distributions. So can you see what is our prior here? Well, the prior here is the probability of each distribution, right. So the prior is given by these two probabilities. In this case, the prior is saying that each model is equally likely. But we can imagine perhaps a different apply is possible. So this is called a pry because this is our guess of which distribution has been used to generate the word. Before we even observed the word. So that's why we call it a pry. If we don't observe the word we don't know what word has been observed. Our best guess is to say, well, they're equally likely. So it's just like flipping a coin.", "Now in basic inference, we typical them with our belief after we have observed the evidence. So what is the evidence here? Well, the evidence here is the word text. Now that we know we're interested in the word text. So text can be regarded as evidence. And if we use base rule to combine the prior and the theta likelihood, what we will end up with is to combine the prior with the likelihood that you see here. Which is basically the probability of the word text from each distribution. And we see that in both cases text is possible. Note that even in the background it is still possible, it just has a very small probability. So intuitively what would be your guess seeing this case? Now if you're like many others, you would guess text is probably from c.subd it's more likely from c.subd, why? And you will probably see that it's because text has a much higher probability here by the C now sub D than by the background model which has a very small probability. And by this we're going to say well, text is more likely from theta sub d. So you see our guess of which distributing has been used with the generated text would depend on how high the probability of the data, the text, is in each word distribution. We can do tentative guess that distribution that gives is a word higher probability. And this is likely to maximize the likelihood. All right, so we are going to choose a word that has a higher likelihood. So, in other words we are going to compare these two probabilities of the word given by each of these distributions. But our guess must also be affected by the prior. So we also need to compare these two priors. Why? Because imagine if we adjust these probabilities. We're going to say, the probability of choosing a background model is almost 100 Now if we have that kind of strong prior, then that would affect your gas. You might think, well, wait a moment, maybe texter could have been from the background as well. Although the probability is very small here the prior is very high. So in the end, we have to combine the two. And the base formula provides us a solid and principle way of making this kind of guess to quantify that. So more specifically, let's think about the probability that this word text has been generated in fact from theta sub d. Well, in order for text to be generated from theta sub d, two things must happen. First, the theta sub d must have been selected. So, we have the selection probability here. And secondly we also have to actually have observed the text from the distribution. So, when we multiply the two together, we get the probability that text has in fact been generated from zero sub d. Similarly, for the background model and the probability of generating text is another product of similar form. Now we also introduced late in the variable z here to denote whether the word is from the background or the topic. When z is 0, it means it's from the topic, theta sub d. When it's 1, it means it's from the background, theta sub B. So now we have the probability that text is generated from each, then we can simply normalize them to have estimate of the probability that the word text is from theta sub d or from theta sub B. And equivalently the probability that Z is equal to zero, given that the observed evidence is text. So this is application of base rule. But this step is very crucial for understanding the EM hours. Because if we can do this, then we would be able to first, initialize the parameter values somewhat randomly. And then, we're going to take a guess of these Z values and all, which distributing has been used to generate which word. And the initialize the parameter values would allow us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which allows us to apply Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. And this prediction essentially helped us to separate words from the two distributions. Although we can't separate them for sure, but we can separate then probabilistically as shown here.", "So in all the EM algorithms we introduce a hidden variable to help us solve the problem more easily. In our case the hidden variable is a binary variable for each occurrence of a word as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em} And this binary variable would indicate whether the word has been generated from 0 sub d or 0 sub p. And here we show some possible values of these variables. For example, for the it's from background, the z value is one. And text on the other hand. Is from the topic then it's zero for z, etc. Now, of course, we don't observe these z values, we just imagine they're all such. Values of z attaching to other words. And that's why we call these hidden variables. Now, the idea that we talked about before for predicting the word distribution that has been used when we generate the word is it a predictor, the value of this hidden variable? And, so, the EM algorithm then, would work as follows. First, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values. In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in. Okay, so, as I said, the bridge between the two is really the variable z, hidden variable, which indicates how likely this water is from the top water distribution, theta sub p. So, this slide has a lot of content and you may need to. Pause the reader to digest it. But this basically captures the essence of EM Algorithm. Start with initial values that are often random themself. And then we invoke E-step followed by M-step to get an improved setting of parameters. And then we repeated this, so this a Hill-Climbing algorithm that would gradually improve the estimate of parameters.", "So in this setting we have assumed the two numerals have equal probabilities and the background model is null. So what are the relevance of the statistics? Well these are the word counts. So assume we have just four words, and their counts are like this. And this is our background model that assigns high probabilities to common words like the. And in the first iteration, you can picture what will happen. Well first we initialize all the values. So here, this probability that we're interested in is normalized into a uniform distribution of all the words. And then the E-step would give us a guess of the distribution that has been used. That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm. As you can see in the last row where we show the log-likelihood, and the likelihood is increasing as we do the iteration. And note that these log-likelihood is negative because the probability is between 0 and 1 when you take a logarithm, it becomes a negative value. Now what's also interesting is, you'll note the last column. And these are the inverted word split. And these are the probabilities that a word is believed to have come from one distribution, in this case the topical distribution, all right. And you might wonder whether this would be also useful. Because our main goal is to estimate these word distributions. So this is our primary goal. We hope to have a more discriminative order of distribution. But the last column is also bi-product. This also can actually be very useful. You can think about that. We want to use, is to for example is to estimate to what extent this document has covered background words. And this, when we add this up or take the average we will kind of know to what extent it has covered background versus content was that are not explained well by the background.", "The EM algorithm is such an algorithm. It's a Hill-Climb algorithm. That would mean you start with some random guess. Let's say you start from here, that's your starting point. And then you try to improve this by moving this to another point where you can have a higher likelihood. So that's the ideal hill climbing. And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point. And that's why EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. Now, as you can imagine, when we have many local maxima, we also have to repeat the EM algorithm multiple times. In order to figure out which one is the actual global maximum. And this actually in general is a difficult problem in numeral optimization. So here for example had we started from here, then we gradually just climb up to this top. So, that's not optimal, and we'd like to climb up all the way to here, so the only way to climb up to this gear is to start from somewhere here or here. So, in the EM algorithm, we generally would have to start from different points or have some other way to determine a good initial starting point. To summarize in this lecture we introduced the EM algorithm. This is a general algorithm for computing maximum maximum likelihood estimate of all kinds of models, so not just for our simple model. And it's a hill-climbing algorithm, so it can only converge to a local maximum and it will depend on initial points. The general idea is that we will have two steps to improve the estimate of. In the E-step we roughly [INAUDIBLE] how many there are by predicting values of useful hidden variables that we would use to simplify the estimation. In our case, this is the distribution that has been used to generate the word. In the M-step then we would exploit such augmented data which would make it easier to estimate the distribution, to improve the estimate of parameters. Here improve is guaranteed in terms of the likelihood function."], "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/12": ["The main idea of the EM algorithm is to ``augment'' our data with some latent variables so that the ``complete'' data has a much simpler likelihood function---simpler for the purpose of finding  a maxima. The original data are thus treated as ``incomplete''. As we will see, we will maximize the incomplete data likelihood (our original goal) through maximizing the expected complete data likelihood (since it is much easier to maximize) where expectation is taken over all possible values of the hidden variables (since the complete data likelihood, unlike our original incomplete data likelihood,  would contain hidden variables)."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/26": ["In this lecture, we're going to continue discussing probabilistic models. We're going to talk about a very simple case where we are interested in just mining one topic from one document. So in this simple setup (illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:one-topic}) we are interested in analyzing one document and trying to discover just one topic. So this is the simplest case of topic model. The input now no longer has k, which is the number of topics because we know there is only one topic and the collection has only one document, also. In the output, we also no longer have coverage because we assumed that the document covers this topic 100. So the main goal is just to discover the world of probabilities for this single topic, as shown here. As always, when we think about using a generating model to solve such a problem, we start with thinking about what kind of data we are going to model or from what perspective we're going to model the data or data representation. And then we're going to design a specific model for the generating of the data, from our perspective. Where our perspective just means we want to take a particular angle of looking at the data, so that the model will have the right parameters for discovering the knowledge that we want. And then we'll be thinking about the microfunction or write down the microfunction to capture more formally how likely a data point will be obtained from this model. And the likelihood function will have some parameters in the function. And then we argue our interest in estimating those parameters for example, by maximizing the likelihood which will lead to maximum likelihood estimated. These estimator parameters will then become the output of the mining hours, which means we'll take the estimating parameters as the knowledge that we discover from the text. So let's look at these steps for this very simple case shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:unigram}. Later we'll look at this procedure for some more complicated cases. So our data, in this case is, just a document which is a sequence of words. Each word here is denoted by x sub i. Our model is a Unigram language model. A word distribution that we hope to denote a topic and that's our goal. So we will have as many parameters as many words in our vocabulary, in this case M. And for convenience we're going to use theta sub i to denote the probability of word w sub i. And obviously these theta sub i's will sum to 1. Now what does a likelihood function look like? Well, this is just the probability of generating this whole document, that given such a model. Because we assume the independence in generating each word so the probability of the document will be just a product of the probability of each word. And since some word might have repeated occurrences. So we can also rewrite this product in a different form. So in this line, we have rewritten the formula into a product over all the unique words in the vocabulary, w sub 1 through w sub M. Now this is different from the previous line. Well, the product is over different positions of words in the document. Now when we do this transformation, we then would need to introduce a counter function here. This denotes the count of word one in document and similarly this is the count of words of n in the document because these words might have repeated occurrences. You can also see if a word did not occur in the document. It will have a zero count, therefore that corresponding term will disappear. So this is a very useful form of writing down the likelihood function that we will often use later. So I want you to pay attention to this, just get familiar with this notation. It's just to change the product over all the different words in the vocabulary. So in the end, of course, we'll use theta sub i to express this likelihood function and it would look like this. Next, we're going to find the theta values or probabilities of these words that would maximize this likelihood function.", "This lecture is about the mixture of unigram language models. In this lecture we will continue discussing probabilistic topic models. In particular, what we introduce a mixture of unigram language models. This is a slide that you have seen earlier. Where we talked about how to get rid of the background words that we have on top of for one document. So if you want to solve the problem, it would be useful to think about why we end up having this problem. Well, this obviously because these words are very frequent in our data and we are using a maximum likelihood to estimate. Then the estimate obviously would have to assign high probability for these words in order to maximize the likelihood. So, in order to get rid of them that would mean we'd have to do something differently here. In particular we'll have to say this distribution doesn't have to explain all the words in the tax data. What were going to say is that, these common words should not be explained by this distribution. So one natural way to solve the problem is to think about using another distribution to account for just these common words as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:mix-background}. This way, the two distributions can be mixed together to generate the text data. And we'll let the other model which we'll call background topic model to generate the common words. This way our target topic theta here will be only generating the common handle words that are characterised the content of the document. So, how does this work? Well, it is just a small modification of the previous setup where we have just one distribution. Since we now have two distributions, we have to decide which distribution to use when we generate the word. Each word will still be a sample from one of the two distributions. Text data is still generating the same way. Namely, look at the generating of the one word at each time and eventually we generate a lot of words. When we generate the word, however, we're going to first decide which of the two distributions to use. And this is controlled by another probability, the probability of theta sub d and the probability of theta sub B here. So this is a probability of enacting the topic word of distribution. This is the probability of enacting the background word of distribution denoted by theta sub B. On this case I just give example where we can set both to 0.5. So you're going to basically flip a coin, a fair coin, to decide what you want to use. But in general these probabilities don't have to be equal. So you might bias toward using one topic more than the other. So now the process of generating a word would be to first we flip a coin. Based on these probabilities choosing each model and if let's say the coin shows up as head, which means we're going to use the topic two word distribution. Then we're going to use this word distribution to generate a word. Otherwise we might be going slow this path. And we're going to use the background word distribution to generate a word. So in such a case, we have a model that has some uncertainty associated with the use of a word distribution. But we can still think of this as a model for generating text data. And such a model is called a mixture model.", "So to summarize what we observed here. The probability of a word from a mixture model is a general sum of different ways of generating the word. In each case, it's a product of the probability of selecting that component model. Multiplied by the probability of actually observing the data point from that component of the model. And this is something quite general and you will see this occurring often later. So the basic idea of a mixture model is just to retrieve these two distributions together as one model. So I used a box to bring all these components together in Figure~\\ref{fig:idea-mixlm}. So if you view this whole box as one model, it's just like any other generative model. It would just give us the probability of a word. But the way that determines this probability is quite the different from when we have just one distribution. And this is basically a more complicated mixture model. So the more complicated is more than just one distribution. And it's called a mixture model. So as I just said we can treat this as a generative model. And it's often useful to think of just as a likelihood function."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": ["This lecture is about probabilistic and latent Semantic Analysis or PLSA. In this lecture we're going to introduce probabilistic latent semantic analysis, often called PLSA. This is the most basic topic model, also one of the most useful topic models. Now this kind of models can in general be used to mine multiple topics from text documents. And PRSA is one of the most basic topic models for doing this.\n\nSo the overall of topic analysis here is to try to decode these topics behind the text, to segment the topics, to figure out which words are from which distribution and to figure out first, what are these topics? How do we know there's a topic about government response. There's a topic about a flood in the city. So these are the tasks at the top of the model. If we had discovered these topics can color these words, as you see here, to separate the different topics. Then you can do a lot of things, such as summarization, or segmentation, of the topics, clustering of the sentences etc.\n\nSo the idea of PLSA is actually very similar to the two component mixture model that we have already introduced. The only difference is that we are going to have more than two topics. Otherwise, it is essentially the same.", "So let's first look at how the word can be generated from the background mode. Well, the probability that the word is generated from the background model is lambda multiplied by the probability of the word from the background mode. Model, right. Two things must happen. First, we have to have chosen the background model, and that's the probability of lambda, of sub b. Then second, we must have actually obtained the word w from the background, and that's probability of w given theta sub b. Okay, so similarly, we can figure out the probability of observing the word from another topic. Like the topic theta sub k. Now notice that here's the product of three terms. And that's because of the choice of topic theta sub k, only happens if two things happen. One is we decide not to talk about background. So, that's a probability of 1 minus lambda sub B. Second, we also have to actually choose theta sub K among these K topics. So that's probability of theta sub K, or pi. And similarly, the probability of generating a word from the second. The topic and the first topic are like what you are seeing here. And so in the end the probability of observing the word is just a sum of all these cases. And I have to stress again this is a very important formula to know because this is really key to understanding all the topic models and indeed a lot of mixture models. So make sure that you really understand the probability of w is indeed the sum of these terms.", "So, in terms of computation of this EM algorithm, we can actually just keep accounting various events and then normalize them. And when we thinking this way, we also have a more concise way of presenting the EM Algorithm. It actually helps us better understand the formulas. So I'm going to go over this in some detail. Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-em-comp} shows the computation of the EM algorithm for PLSA. So as a algorithm we first initialize all the unknown perimeters randomly, all right. So, in our case, we are interested in all of those coverage perimeters, pi's and awarded distributions [INAUDIBLE], and we just randomly normalize them. This is the initialization step and then we will repeat until likelihood converges. Now how do we know whether likelihood converges? We can do compute likelihood at each step and compare the current likelihood with the previous likelihood. If it doesn't change much and we're going to say it stopped, right. So, in each step we're going to do e-step and m-step. In the e-step we're going to do augment the data by predicting the hidden variables. In this case, the hidden variable, z sub d, w, indicates whether the word w in d is from a topic or background. And if it's from a topic, which topic. So if you look at the e-step formulas, essentially we're actually normalizing these counts, sorry, these probabilities of observing the word from each distribution. So you can see, basically the prediction of word from topic zero sub j is based on the probability of selecting that theta sub j as a word distribution to generate the word. Multiply by the probability of observing the word from that distribution. And I said it's proportional to this because in the implementation of EM algorithm you can keep counter for this quantity, and in the end it just normalizes it. So the normalization here is over all the topics and then you would get a probability. Now, in the m-step, we do the same, and we are going to collect these. Allocated account for each topic. And we split words among the topics. And then we're going to normalize them in different ways to obtain the real estimate. So for example, we can normalize among all the topics to get the re-estimate of pi, the coverage. Or we can re-normalize based on all the words. And that would give us a word distribution. So it's useful to think algorithm in this way because when implemented, you can just use variables, but keep track of these quantities in each case. And then you just normalize these variables to make them distribution. Now I did not put the constraint for this one. And I intentionally leave this as an exercise for you. And you can see, what's the normalizer for this one? It's of a slightly different form but it's essentially the same as the one that you have seen here in this one. So in general in the envisioning of EM algorithms you will see you accumulate the counts, various counts and then you normalize them. So to summarize, we introduced the PLSA model. Which is a mixture model with k unigram language models representing k topics. And we also added a pre-determined background language model to help discover discriminative topics, because this background language model can help attract the common terms. And we select the maximum estimate that we cant discover topical knowledge from text data. In this case PLSA allows us to discover two things, one is k worded distributions, each one representing a topic and the other is the proportion of each topic in each document. And such detailed characterization of coverage of topics in documents can enable a lot of photo analysis. For example, we can aggregate the documents in the particular pan period to assess the coverage of a particular topic in a time period. That would allow us to generate the temporal chains of topics. We can also aggregate topics covered in documents associated with a particular author and then we can categorize the topics written by this author, etc. And in addition to this, we can also cluster terms and cluster documents."], "textbook/textdatabook/word-association/syntagmatic.jsonl/20": ["In particular, the mutual information of $X$ and $Y$, denoted $I(X;Y)$, is the reduction in entropy of $X$ obtained from knowing $Y$. Specifically, the question we are interested in here is how much of a reduction in entropy of $X$ can we obtain by knowing $Y$. Mathematically, mutual information can be defined as\nMutual information is always non-negative. This is easy to understand because the original entropy is always not going to be lower than the (possibly) reduced conditional entropy. In other words, the conditional entropy will never exceed the original entropy; knowing some information can always help us potentially, but will not hurt us in predicting $X$. Another property is that mutual information is symmetric: $I(X;Y) = I(Y;X)$. A third property is that it reaches its minimum, zero, if and only if the two random variables are completely independent. That means knowing one of them does not tell us anything about the other.\nWhen we fix $X$ to rank different $Y$s using conditional entropy, we would get the same order as ranking based on mutual information. Thus, ranking based on mutual entropy is exactly the same as ranking based on the conditional entropy of $X$ given $Y$, but the mutual information allows us to compare different pairs of $X$ and $Y$. That is why mutual information is more general and more useful.\nThe question we ask is: whenever \\emph{eats} occurs, what other words also tend to occur? This question can be framed as a mutual information question; that is, which words have high mutual information with \\emph{eats}?\nFor example, we know the mutual information between \\emph{eats} and \\emph{meat}, which is the same as between \\emph{meat} and \\emph{eats} because the mutual information is symmetric. This is expected to be higher than the mutual information between \\emph{eats} and \\emph{the}, because knowing \\emph{the} does not really help us predict the other word. You also can easily see that the mutual information between a word and itself is the largest, which is equal to the entropy of the word. In that case, the reduction is maximum because knowing one allows us to predict the other completely. In other words, the conditional entropy is zero which means mutual information reaches its maximum.", "To summarize, syntagmatic relations can generally be discovered by measuring correlations between occurrences of two words. We've used three concepts from information theory: entropy, which measures the uncertainty of a random variable $X$; conditional entropy, which measures the entropy of $X$ given we know $Y$; and mutual information of $X$ and $Y$, which matches the entropy reduction of $X$ due to knowing $Y$, or entropy reduction of $Y$ due to knowing $X$. These three concepts are actually very useful for other applications as well. That's why we spent some time to explain this in detail. Mutual information allows us to have values computed on different pairs of words that are comparable, allowing us to rank these pairs and discover the strongest syntagmatic relations from a collection of documents."], "textbook/textdatabook/web-search/links.jsonl/11": ["Google's PageRank, a main technique that was used originally for link analysis, is a good example of leveraging page link information. PageRank captures page popularity, which is another word for authority. The intuition is that links are just like citations in literature. Think about one page pointing to another page; this is very similar to one paper citing another paper. Thus, if a page is cited often, we can assume this page is more useful. PageRank takes advantage of this intuition and implements it in a principled approach. In its simplest sense, PageRank is essentially doing citation counting or inlink counting.\nIt improves this simple idea in two ways. One is to consider indirect citations. This means you don't just look at the number of inlinks, rather you also look at the inlinks of your inlinks, recursively. If your inlinks themselves have many inlinks, your page gets credit from that. In short, if important pages are pointing to you, you must also be important. On the other hand, if those pages that are pointing to you are not are being pointed to by many other pages, then you don't get that much credit. This is the concept of indirect citations, or cascading citations.\nAgain, we can understand this idea by considering research papers. If you are cited by ten papers that are not very influential, that's not as good as if you're cited by ten papers that themselves have attracted a lot of other citations. Clearly, this is a case where we would like to consider indirect links, which is exactly what PageRank does. The other idea is that it's good to smooth the citations. Assume that every page has a non-zero pseudo citation count. Essentially, you are trying to imagine there are many virtual links that will link all the pages together so that you actually get pseudo citations from everyone.\nAnother way to understand PageRank is the concept of a random surfer visiting every Web page. Let's take a look at this example in detail, illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:link-example}. On the left, there is a small graph, where each document $d_1, d_2, d_3,$ and $d_4$ is a Web page, and the edges between documents are hyperlinks connecting them to each other. Let's assume that a random surfer or random walker can be on any of these pages. When the random surfer decides to move to a different page, they can either randomly follow a link from the current page or randomly choose a document to jump to from the entire collection. So, if the random surfer is at $d_1$, with some probability that random surfer will follow the links to either $d_3$ or $d_4$. The random surfing model also assumes that the surfer might get bored sometimes and decide to ignore the actual links, randomly jumping to any page on the Web. If the surfer takes that option, they would be able to reach any of the other pages even though there is no link directly to that page. Based on this model, we can ask the question, ``How likely, on average, would the surfer reach a particular page?'' This probability is precisely what PageRank computes.\nThe PageRank score of a document $d_i$ is the average probability that the surfer visits $d_i$. Intuitively, this should be proportional to the inlink count. If a page has a high number of inlinks then it would have a higher chance of being visited since there will be more opportunities of having the surfer follow a link there. This is how the random surfing model captures the idea of counting the inlinks. But, it also considers the indirect inlinks; if the pages that point to $d_i$ have themselves a lot of inlinks, that would mean the random surfer would very likely reach one of them. This increases the chance of visiting $d_i$. This is a nice way to capture both indirect and direct links.", "We have zeros for the first two columns for $d_1$ since $d_1$ doesn't link to itself and it doesn't link to $d_2$. Thus, $M_{ij}$ is the probability of going from $d_i$ to $d_j$. Each row's values should sum to one, because the surfer will have to go to precisely one of these pages. Now, how can we compute the probability of a surfer visiting a particular page? We can compute the probability of reaching a page as follows: On the left-hand side is the probability of visiting page $d_j$ at time $t+1$, the next time count. On the right side, we can see the equation involves the probability at page $d_i$ at time $t$, the current time step. The equation captures the two possibilities of reaching a page $d_j$ at time $t+1$: through random surfing or following a link. The first part of the equation captures the probability that the random server would reach this page by following a link. The random surfer chooses this strategy with probability $1-\\alpha$; thus, there is a factor of $1-\\alpha$ before this term. This term sums over all the possible $N$ pages that the surfer could have been at time $t$. Inside the sum is the product of two probabilities. One is the probability that the surfer was at $d_i$ at time $t$. That's $p_t(d_i)$. The other is the transition probability from $d_i$ to $d_j$, which we know is represented as $M_{ij}$. So, in order to reach this $d_j$ page, the surfer must first be at $d_i$ at time $t$ and would have to follow the link to go from $d_i$ to $d_j$. The second part is a similar sum. The only difference is that now the transition probability is uniform: $\\frac{1}{N}$. This part captures the probability of reaching this page through random jumping, where $\\alpha$ is the probability of random jumping. This also allows us to see why PageRank captures a smoothing of the transition matrix. You can think this $\\frac{1}{N}$ comes from another transition matrix that has all the elements as $\\frac{1}{N}$. It is then clear that we can merge the two parts. Because they are of the same form, we can imagine there's a different matrix that's a combination of this $M$ and the uniform matrix $I$. In this sense, PageRank uses this idea of smoothing to ensure that there's no $0$ entry in the transition matrix. Now, we can imagine if we want to compute average probabilities, those would satisfy this equation without considering the time index. So let's drop the time index and assume that they would be equal; this would give us $N$ equations, since each page has its own equation. Similarly, there are also precisely $N$ variables. This means we now have a system of $N$ linear equations with $N$ variables. The problem boils down to solving this system of equations, which we can write in the following form: where $$I_{ij} = \\frac{1}{N} \\:\\forall i,j.$$ The vector $\\vec{p}$~equals the transpose of a matrix multiplied by $\\vec{p}$~ again. The transposed matrix is in fact the sum from $1$ to $N$ written in matrix form. Recall from linear algebra that this is precisely the equation for an eigenvector. Thus, this equation can solved by using an iterative algorithm. In this iterative algorithm, called \\emph{power iteration}, we simply start with a random $\\vec{p}$. We then repeatedly update $\\vec{p}$~by multiplying the transposed matrix expression by $\\vec{p}$. Let's look at a concrete example: set $\\alpha=0.2$. This means that there is a $20\\%$ chance of randomly jumping to a page on the entire Web and an $80\\%$ chance of randomly following a link from the current page. We have the original transition matrix $M$ as before that encodes the actual links in the graph. Then, we have this uniform smoothing transition matrix $I$ representing random jumping. We combine them together with interpolation via $\\alpha$ to form another matrix we call $A$:", "The updating formula for this particular page is a PageRank score. If you want to compute the updated value for $d_1$, you multiply the top row in $A$ by the column vector of PageRank scores from the previous iteration. This is how we update the vector; we started with some initial values and iteratively multiply the matrices together, which generates a new set of scores. We repeat this multiplication until the values in $\\vec{p}$ converge. From linear algebra, we know that since there are no zero values, such iteration is guaranteed to converge. At that point we will have the PageRank scores for all the pages. Interestingly, this update formula can be interpreted as propagating scores across the graph. We can imagine we have values initialized on each of these pages, and if you look at the equation, we combine the scores of the pages that would lead to reaching this page. That is, we'll look at all the pages that are pointing to this page and combine their scores with the propagated score in order to get the next score for the current document. We repeat this for all documents, which transfers probability mass across the network. In practice, the calculation of the PageRank score is actually quite efficient because the matrices are sparse---that means that if there isn't a link into the current page, we don't have to worry about it in the calculation."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

So in all the EM algorithms we introduce a hidden variable to help us solve the problem more easily. In our case the hidden variable is a binary variable for each occurrence of a word as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em} And this binary variable would indicate whether the word has been generated from 0 sub d or 0 sub p. And here we show some possible values of these variables. For example, for the it's from background, the z value is one. And text on the other hand. Is from the topic then it's zero for z, etc. Now, of course, we don't observe these z values, we just imagine they're all such. Values of z attaching to other words. And that's why we call these hidden variables. Now, the idea that we talked about before for predicting the word distribution that has been used when we generate the word is it a predictor, the value of this hidden variable? And, so, the EM algorithm then, would work as follows. First, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values. In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in. Okay, so, as I said, the bridge between the two is really the variable z, hidden variable, which indicates how likely this water is from the top water distribution, theta sub p. So, this slide has a lot of content and you may need to. Pause the reader to digest it. But this basically captures the essence of EM Algorithm. Start with initial values that are often random themself. And then we invoke E-step followed by M-step to get an improved setting of parameters. And then we repeated this, so this a Hill-Climbing algorithm that would gradually improve the estimate of parameters.", "the EM algorithm is such an algorithm. It's a Hill-Climb algorithm. That would mean you start with some random guess. Let's say you start from here, that's your starting point. And then you try to improve this by moving this to another point where you can have a higher likelihood. So that's the ideal hill climbing. And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point. And that's why EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. Now, as you can imagine, when we have many local maxima, we also have to repeat the EM algorithm multiple times. In order to figure out which one is the actual global maximum. And this actually in general is a difficult problem in numeral optimization. So here for example had we started from here, then we gradually just climb up to this top. So, that's not optimal, and we'd like to climb up all the way to here, so the only way to climb up to this gear is to start from somewhere here or here. So, in the EM algorithm, we generally would have to start from different points or have some other way to determine a good initial starting point. To summarize in this lecture we introduced the EM algorithm. This is a general algorithm for computing maximum maximum likelihood estimate of all kinds of models, so not just for our simple model. And it's a hill-climbing algorithm, so it can only converge to a local maximum and it will depend on initial points. The general idea is that we will have two steps to improve the estimate of. In the E-step we roughly [INAUDIBLE] how many there are by predicting values of useful hidden variables that we would use to simplify the estimation. In our case, this is the distribution that has been used to generate the word. In the M-step then we would exploit such augmented data which would make it easier to estimate the distribution, to improve the estimate of parameters. Here improve is guaranteed in terms of the likelihood function. Note that it's not necessary that we"], "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/12": ["The main idea of the EM algorithm is to ``augment'' our data with some latent\nvariables so that the ``complete'' data has a much simpler likelihood\nfunction---simpler for the purpose of finding  a maxima.

As we will see, we will maximize the incomplete\ndata likelihood (our original goal) through maximizing the expected complete\ndata likelihood (since it is much easier to maximize) where expectation is taken\nover all possible values of the hidden variables (since the complete data\nlikelihood, unlike our original incomplete data likelihood,  would contain\nhidden variables)."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/26": ["So our data, in this case is, just a document which is a sequence of words. Each word here is denoted by x sub i. Our model is a Unigram language model. A word distribution that we hope to denote a topic and that's our goal. So we will have as many parameters as many words in our vocabulary, in this case M. And for convenience we're going to use theta sub i to denote the probability of word w sub i. And obviously these theta sub i's will sum to 1. Now what does a likelihood function look like? Well, this is just the probability of generating this whole document, that given such a model. Because we assume the independence in generating each word so the probability of the document will be just a product of the probability of each word. And since some word might have repeated occurrences. So we can also rewrite this product in a different form. So in this line, we have rewritten the formula into a product over all the unique words in the vocabulary, w sub 1 through w sub M. Now this is different from the previous line. Well, the product is over different positions of words in the document. Now when we do this transformation, we then would need to introduce a counter function here. This denotes the count of word one in document and similarly this is the count of words of n in the document because these words might have repeated occurrences. You can also see if a word did not occur in the document. It will have a zero count, therefore that corresponding term will disappear. So this is a very useful form of writing down the likelihood function that we will often use later. So I want you to pay attention to this, just get familiar with this notation. It's just to change the product over all the different words in the vocabulary. So in the end, of course, we'll use theta sub i to express this likelihood function and it would look like this. Next, we're going to find the theta values or probabilities of these words that would maximize this likelihood function.", "So the basic idea of a mixture model is just to retrieve thesetwo distributions together as one model. So I used a box to bring all these components together in Figure~\\ref{fig:idea-mixlm}. So if you view this whole box as one model, it's just like any other generative model. It would just give us the probability of a word. But the way that determines this probability is quite the different from when we have just one distribution. And this is basically a more complicated mixture model. So the more complicated is more than just one distribution. And it's called a mixture model."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": ["So the idea of PLSA is actually very similar to the two component mixture model that we have already introduced. The only difference is that we are going to have more than two topics. Otherwise, it is essentially the same. So here I illustrate how we can generate the text that has multiple topics in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-genmod} and naturally in all cases of Probabilistic modelling would want to figure out the likelihood function. So we would also ask the question, what's the probability of observing a word from such a mixture model? Now if you look at this picture and compare this with the picture that we have seen earlier, you will see the only difference is that we have added more topics here. So, before we have just one topic, besides the background topic. But now we have more topics. Specifically, we have k topics now. All these are topics that we assume that exist in the text data. So the consequence is that our switch for choosing a topic is now a multiway switch. Before it's just a two way switch. We can think of it as flipping a coin. But now we have multiple ways. First we can flip a coin to decide whether we're talk about the background. So it's the background lambda sub B versus non-background. 1 minus lambda sub B gives us the probability of actually choosing a non-background topic. After we have made this decision, we have to make another decision to choose one of these K distributions. So there are K way switch here. And this is characterized by pi, and this sum to one. This is just the difference of designs. Which is a little bit more complicated. But once we decide which distribution to use the rest is the same we are going to just generate a word by using one of these distributions as shown here.", "We can compute this maximum estimate by using the EM algorithm.\nSo in the e step (shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-estep},\nwe now have to introduce more hidden\nvariables because we have more topics,\nso our hidden variable z now,\nwhich is a topic indicator can\ntake more than two values.\nSo specifically will\ntake a k plus one values,\nwith b in the noting the background.\nAnd once locate,\nto denote other k topics, right.\nSo, now the e step, as you can\nrecall is your augmented data, and\nby predicting the values\nof the hidden variable.\nSo we're going to predict for\na word, whether the word has come from\none of these k plus one distributions.\nThis equation allows us to\npredict the probability\nthat the word w in document d is\ngenerated from topic zero sub j.\nAnd the bottom one is\nthe predicted probability that this\nword has been generated\nfrom the background.\nNote that we use document\nd here to index the word.\nWhy?\nBecause whether a word is\nfrom a particular topic\nactually depends on the document.\nCan you see why?\nWell, it's through the pi's.\nThe pi's are tied to each document.\nEach document can have potentially\ndifferent pi's, right.\nThe pi's will then affect our prediction.\nSo, the pi's are here.\nAnd this depends on the document.\nAnd that might give a different guess for\na word in different documents,\nand that's desirable.\nIn both cases we are using\nthe Baye's Rule, as I explained, basically\nassessing the likelihood of generating\nword from each of this division and\nthere's normalize.\nWhat about the m step?

Specifically, the question we are interested in here is how much of a reduction in entropy of $X$ can we obtain by knowing $Y$. Mathematically, mutual information can be defined as\nMutual information is always non-negative. This is easy to understand because the original entropy is always not going to be lower than the (possibly) reduced conditional entropy. In other words, the conditional entropy will never exceed the original entropy; knowing some information can always help us potentially, but will not hurt us in predicting $X$. Another property is that mutual information is symmetric: $I(X;Y) = I(Y;X)$. A third property is that it reaches its minimum, zero, if and only if the two random variables are completely independent. That means knowing one of them does not tell us anything about the other.", "at this form of mutual information, it shows that\nthe mutual information matches the divergence of the actual joint distribution\nfrom the expected distribution under the independence assumption. The larger\nthis divergence is, the higher the mutual information would be.\nLet's further look at what these probabilities exactly are that are involved in\nthe mutual information formula displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:mi-prob}.\nFirst, we have to calculate the probabilities corresponding to the presence or\nabsence of each word. For $w_1$, we have two probabilities shown here. They\nshould sum to one, because a word can either be present or absent in the\nsegment, and similarly for the second word, we also have two probabilities\nrepresenting presence or absence of this word. These all sum to one as well.\nFinally, we have a lot of joint probabilities that represent the scenarios of\nco-occurrences of the two words. They also sum to one because the two words can\nonly have the four shown possible scenarios. Once we know how to calculate these\nprobabilities, we can easily calculate the mutual information.\nIt's important to note that there are some constraints among these probabilities\naside from the ones we already mentioned. The first was that the marginal\nprobabilities of these words sum to one. The second was that the two words have\nthese four scenarios of co-occurrence. The additional constraints are listed at\nthe bottom of Figure~\\ref{fig:mi-prob-constraint}.\nThe first new constraint means if we add up the probabilities of two words\nco-occurring and the probabilities when the first word occurs and the second\nword does not occur, we get exactly the probability that the first word is\nobserved. These equations allow us to compute some probabilities based on other\nprobabilities, and this can simplify the computation. More specifically, if we\nknow the probability that a word is present and if we know the probability of\nthe presence of the second word, then we can easily compute the absence\nprobability. It is very easy to use these equations to do that, and so we take\ncare of the computation of these probabilities of presence and absence of each\nword.\nNow let's look at the joint distribution. Assume that we also have available the\nprobability that they occurred together. It's easy to see that we can actually\ncompute all the rest of these probabilities based on these as shown in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:mi-comp}. Using this equation, we can compute the probability\nthat the first word occurred and the second word did not because we know these\nprobabilities in the boxes. Similarly, using this equation we can compute the\nprobability that we observe only the second word. The figure shows that we only\nneed to know how to compute these three boxed probabilities, namely the presence\nof each word and the co-occurrence of both words in a segment.\nIn general, we can use the empirical count of events in the observed data to\nestimate the probabilities as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:mi-prob-est}. A commonly\nused technique is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), where we simply\nnormalize the observed counts. Using MLE, we can compute these probabilities as\nfollows. For estimating the probability that we see a word occuring in a\nsegment, we simply normalize the count of segments that contain this word. On\nthe right side of Figure~\\ref{fig:mi-prob-est}, you see a list of some segments\nof data. In some segments you see both words occur, which is indicated as ones\nfor both columns. In some other cases only one will occur, so only that column\nhas a one and the other column has a zero.\nTo estimate these probabilities, we simply need to collect the three counts: the\ncount of $w_1$ (the total number of segments that contain $w_1$), the segment\ncount for $w_2$, and the count when both words occur (both columns have ones).\nOnce we have these counts, we can just normalize these counts by $N$, which is\nthe total number of segments, giving us the probabilities that we need to\ncompute mutual information.\nThere is a small problem when we have zero counts sometimes. In this case, we\ndon't want a zero probability, so we use smoothing, as discussed previously in\nthis book.\nTo smooth, we will add a small constant to these counts so that we don't get\nzero probability in any case. Smoothing for this application is displayed in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:mi-smooth}. We pretend to observe pseudo-segments that would\ncontribute additional counts of these words so that no event will have zero\nprobability."], "textbook/textdatabook/web-search/links.jsonl/11": ["Google's PageRank, a main technique that was used originally for link analysis, is a good example of leveraging page link information. PageRank captures page popularity, which is another word for authority. The intuition is that links are just like citations in literature. Think about one page pointing to another page; this is very similar to one paper citing another paper. Thus, if a page is cited often, we can assume this page is more useful. PageRank takes advantage of this intuition and implements it in a principled approach. In its simplest sense, PageRank is essentially doing citation counting or inlink counting.\nIt improves this simple idea in two ways. One is to consider indirect citations. This means you don't just look at the number of inlinks, rather you also look at the inlinks of your inlinks, recursively. If your inlinks themselves have many inlinks, your page gets credit from that. In short, if important pages are pointing to you, you must also be important. On the other hand, if those pages that are pointing to you are not are being pointed to by many other pages, then you don't get that much credit. This is the concept of indirect citations, or cascading citations.\nAgain, we can understand this idea by considering research papers. If you are cited by ten papers that are not very influential, that's not as good as if you're cited by ten papers that themselves have attracted a lot of other citations. Clearly, this is a case where we would like to consider indirect links, which is exactly what PageRank does. The other idea is that it's good to smooth the citations. Assume that every page has a non-zero pseudo citation count. Essentially, you are trying to imagine there are many virtual links that will link all the pages together so that you actually get pseudo citations from everyone.\nAnother way to understand PageRank is the concept of a random surfer visiting every Web page. Let's take a look at this example in detail, illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:link-example}. On the left, there is a small graph, where each document $d_1, d_2, d_3,$ and $d_4$ is a Web page, and the edges between documents are hyperlinks connecting them to each other. Let's assume that a random surfer or random walker can be on any of these pages. When the random surfer decides to move to a different page, they can either randomly follow a link from the current page or randomly choose a document to jump to from the entire collection. So, if the random surfer is at $d_1$, with some probability that random surfer will follow the links to either $d_3$ or $d_4$. The random surfing model also assumes that the surfer might get bored sometimes and decide to ignore the actual links, randomly jumping to any page on the Web. If the surfer takes that option, they would be able to reach any of the other pages even though there is no link directly to that page. Based on this model, we can ask the question, ``How likely, on average, would the surfer reach a particular page?'' This probability is precisely what PageRank computes.\nThe PageRank score of a document $d_i$ is the average probability that the surfer visits $d_i$. Intuitively, this should be proportional to the inlink count. If a page has a high number of inlinks then it would have a higher chance of being visited since there will be more opportunities of having the surfer follow a link there. This is how the random surfing model captures the idea of counting the inlinks. But, it also considers the indirect inlinks; if the pages that point to $d_i$ have themselves a lot of inlinks, that would mean the random surfer would very likely reach one of them. This increases the chance of visiting $d_i$. This is a nice way to capture both indirect and direct links.", "The equation captures the two possibilities of reaching a page $d_j$ at time $t+1$: through random surfing or following a link. The first part of the equation captures the probability that the random server would reach this page by following a link. The random surfer chooses this strategy with probability $1-\\alpha$; thus, there is a factor of $1-\\alpha$ before this term. This term sums over all the possible $N$ pages that the surfer could have been at time $t$. Inside the sum is the product of two probabilities. One is the probability that the surfer was at $d_i$ at time $t$. That's $p_t(d_i)$. The other is the transition probability from $d_i$ to $d_j$, which we know is represented as $M_{ij}$. So, in order to reach this $d_j$ page, the surfer must first be at $d_i$ at time $t$ and would have to follow the link to go from $d_i$ to $d_j$. The second part is a similar sum. The only difference is that now the transition probability is uniform: $\\frac{1}{N}$. This part captures the probability of reaching this page through random jumping, where $\\alpha$ is the probability of random jumping.", "The updating formula for this particular page is a PageRank score. If you want to compute the updated value for $d_1$, you multiply the top row in $A$ by the column vector of PageRank scores from the previous iteration. This is how we update the vector; we started with some initial values and iteratively multiply the matrices together, which generates a new set of scores. We repeat this multiplication until the values in $\\vec{p}$ converge. From linear algebra, we know that since there are no zero values, such iteration is guaranteed to converge. At that point we will have the PageRank scores for all the pages. Interestingly, this update formula can be interpreted as propagating scores across the graph. We can imagine we have values initialized on each of these pages, and if you look at the equation, we combine the scores of the pages that would lead to reaching this page. That is, we'll look at all the pages that are pointing to this page and combine their scores with the propagated score in order to get the next score for the current document. We repeat this for all documents, which transfers probability mass across the network."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-8757": 1, "wikipedia-5068075": 2, "wikipedia-3212380": 2, "wikipedia-2732435": 2, "wikipedia-251323": 1, "wikipedia-7850102": 1, "wikipedia-228015": 2, "wikipedia-5074378": 2, "wikipedia-20847621": 2, "wikipedia-10351396": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/introduction/organization.jsonl/1": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/12": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/2": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/26": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/text-analysis-overview/non-text.jsonl/5": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/word-association/syntagmatic.jsonl/20": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/web-search/links.jsonl/11": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/meta-overview/design-philosophy.jsonl/0": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-8757": 1, "wikipedia-5068075": 3, "wikipedia-3212380": 3, "wikipedia-2732435": 3, "wikipedia-251323": 1, "wikipedia-7850102": 1, "wikipedia-228015": 3, "wikipedia-5074378": 3, "wikipedia-20847621": 3, "wikipedia-10351396": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/introduction/organization.jsonl/1": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/12": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/search-engine-eval.jsonl/2": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/26": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/text-analysis-overview/non-text.jsonl/5": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/word-association/syntagmatic.jsonl/20": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/web-search/links.jsonl/11": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/meta-overview/design-philosophy.jsonl/0": 1}}}

After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in. Okay, so, as I said, the bridge between the two is really the variable z, hidden variable, which indicates how likely this water is from the top water distribution, theta sub p. Start with initial values that are often random themself. And then we invoke E-step followed by M-step to get an improved setting of parameters. And then we repeated this, so this a Hill-Climbing algorithm that would gradually improve the estimate of parameters.", "In the first iteration, you can picture what will happen. Well first we initialize all the values. So here, this probability that we're interested in is normalized into a uniform distribution of all the words. And then the E-step would give us a guess of the distribution that has been used. That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm.", "And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point. And that's why EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum."], "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/13": ["Algorithmically, the basic idea of EM is to start with some initial guess of the parameter values $\\theta^{(0)}$ and then iteratively search for better values for the parameters. Assuming that the current estimate of the parameters is $\\theta^{(n)}$, our goal is to find another $\\theta^{(n+1)}$ that can improve the likelihood $L(\\theta)$.\nLet us consider the difference between the likelihood at a potentially better parameter value $\\theta$ and the likelihood at the current estimate $\\theta^{(n)}$, and relate it with the corresponding difference in the complete likelihood:\nOur goal is to maximize $L(\\theta)-L(\\theta^{(n)})$, which is equivalent to maximizing $L(\\theta)$. Now take the expectation of this equation w.r.t. the conditional distribution of the hidden variable given the data $X$ and the current estimate of parameters $\\theta^{(n)}$, i.e., $p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)})$. We have\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nL(\\theta) - L(\\theta^{(n)} ) & = & \\sum_{H} L_c(\\theta)p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)}) -\n    \\sum_{H} L_c(\\theta^{(n)} )p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)}) \\\\\n    &+& \\sum_H p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)}) \\log \\frac{ p(\n    H|X,\\theta^{(n)})}{p(H|X,\\theta)}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nNote that the left side of the equation remains the same as the variable $H$\ndoes not occur there.

If you want to compute the updated value for $d_1$, you multiply the top row in $A$ by the column vector of PageRank scores from the previous iteration. This is how we update the vector; we started with some initial values and iteratively multiply the matrices together, which generates a new set of scores. We repeat this multiplication until the values in $\\vec{p}$ converge. From linear algebra, we know that since there are no zero values, such iteration is guaranteed to converge. At that point we will have the PageRank scores for all the pages. Interestingly, this update formula can be interpreted as propagating scores across the graph. We can imagine we have values initialized on each of these pages, and if you look at the equation, we combine the scores of the pages that would lead to reaching this page.

In each iteration, it would invoke an E-step followed by an M-step, which will be explained in more detail.", "Understanding how to make such a Bayesian inference of which distribution has been used to generate a word based on a set of tentative parameter values is very crucial for understanding the EM algorithm. This is essentially the E-step of the EM algorithm where we use Bayes' rule to partition data and allocate all the data points among all the component models in the mixture model.", "The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values.\nA main idea of EM is to leverage such hidden variables to simplify the computation of the ML estimate since knowing the values of these hidden variables makes the ML estimate trivial to compute; we can pool together all the words whose $z$ values are 0 and normalize their counts. Knowing $z$ values can potentially help simplify the task of computing the ML estimate, and EM exploits this fact by alternating the E-step and M-step in each iteration so as to improve the parameter estimate in a hill-climbing manner.\nSpecifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.", "This new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values, leading to a new generation of probabilities for the $z$ values, which can be fed into another M-step to generate yet another generation of potentially improved estimate of $\theta_d$. In the last row of the table, we show the log-likelihood after each iteration. Since each iteration would lead to a different generation of parameter estimates, it would also give a different value for the log-likelihood function. These log-likelihood values are all negative because the probability is between 0 and 1, which becomes a negative value after the logarithm transformation. We see that after each iteration, the log-likelihood value is increasing, showing that the EM algorithm is iteratively improving the estimated parameter values in a hill-climbing manner.", "The EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm. It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. You might wonder why we don't work on finding an improved parameter value directly on the original likelihood function. Indeed, it is possible to do that, but in the EM algorithm, the auxiliary function is usually much easier to optimize than the original likelihood function, so in this sense, it reduces the problem into a somewhat simpler one. Although the auxiliary function is generally easier to optimize, it does not always have an analytical solution, which means that the maximization of the auxiliary function may itself require another iterative process, which would be embedded in the overall iterative process of the EM algorithm.", "Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values. This process is repeated until convergence to a local maximum of the likelihood function."], "textbook/textdatabook/feedback/lm-feedback.jsonl/5": ["Once we're thinking this way, we can do exactly the same as what we did before by using MLE to adjust this model and set the parameters to best explain the data. The difference, however, is that we are not asking this model alone to explain this; rather, we're going to ask the whole mixture model to explain the data. As a result, it doesn't have to assign high probabilities towards words like \\emph{the}, which is exactly what we want. It would then assign high probabilities to other words that are common in the topic distribution but not having high probability in the background distribution. As a result, this topic model must assign high probabilities to the words common in the feedback documents yet not to words that are common across the whole collection.\nMathematically, we have to compute the log likelihood of the feedback documents $F$ with another parameter $\\lambda$, which denotes noise in the feedback documents. We assume it will be fixed to some value. Assuming it's fixed, then we only have word probabilities $\\theta$ as parameters, just like in the simplest unigram language model. This gives us the following formula to estimate the feedback language model:\nWe choose this probability distribution $\\theta_F$ to maximize the log likelihood of the feedback documents under our model. This is the same idea as the maximum likelihood estimator. Here though, the mathematical problem is to solve this optimization problem. We could try all possible $\\theta$ values and select the one that gives the whole expression the maximum probability.

So, in other words we are going to compare these two probabilities of the word given by each of these distributions. But our guess must also be affected by the prior. So we also need to compare these two priors. Why? Because imagine if we adjust these probabilities. We're going to say, the probability of choosing a background model is almost 100 Now if we have that kind of strong prior, then that would affect your gas. You might think, well, wait a moment, maybe texter could have been from the background as well. Although the probability is very small here the prior is very high. So in the end, we have to combine the two. And the base formula provides us a solid and principle way of making this kind of guess to quantify that. So now we have the probability that text is generated from each, then we can simply normalize them to have estimate of the probability that the word text is from theta sub d or from theta sub B. And equivalently the probability that Z is equal to zero, given that the observed evidence is text. So this is application of base rule. But this step is very crucial for understanding the EM hours. Because if we can do this, then we would be able to first, initialize the parameter values somewhat randomly. And then, we're going to take a guess of these Z values and all, which distributing has been used to generate which word. And the initialize the parameter values would allow us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which allows us to apply Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. And this prediction essentially helped us to separate words from the two distributions. Although we can't separate them for sure, but we can separate then probabilistically as shown here.", "Now, the idea that we talked about before for predicting the word distribution that has been used when we generate the word is it a predictor, the value of this hidden variable? And, so, the EM algorithm then, would work as follows. First, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values. In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in. Okay, so, as I said, the bridge between the two is really the variable z, hidden variable, which indicates how likely this water is from the top water distribution, theta sub p. So, this slide has a lot of content and you may need to. Pause the reader to digest it. But this basically captures the essence of EM Algorithm. Start with initial values that are often random themself. And then we invoke E-step followed by M-step to get an improved setting of parameters. And then we repeated this, so this a Hill-Climbing algorithm that would gradually improve the estimate of parameters.", "So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm. As you can see in the last row where we show the log-likelihood, and the likelihood is increasing as we do the iteration.", "And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point. And that's why EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum."], "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/13": ["Algorithmically, the basic idea of EM is to start with some initial guess of the\nparameter values $\\theta^{(0)}$ and then iteratively search for better values\nfor the parameters.

The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values.", "Once we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the\nM-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the\ncorresponding words.

At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function.", "First, it would randomly initialize all the parameters to be estimated.

Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values.

This model actually makes the query likelihood retrieval function much closer to the vector space model. Despite this, the new form of the language model retrieval can still be regarded as a generalization of query likelihood (in that it covers query likelihood without feedback as a special case). Here, the feedback can be achieved through simple query document model estimation or updating. This is very similar to Rocchio feedback which updates the query vector; in this case, we update the query language model instead.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:kl-div} shows the difference between our original query likelihood formula and the generalized KL-divergence model. On top, we have the query likelihood retrieval function. The KL-divergence (also called cross entropy) retrieval model generalizes the query term frequency into a probabilistic distribution. This distribution is the only difference, which is able to characterize the user's query in a more general way. This query language model can be estimated in many different ways---including using feedback information. This method is called KL-divergence because this can be interpreted as measuring the divergence (\\ie, difference) between two distributions; one is the query model $p(w|\\hat{\\theta}_Q)$ and the other is the document language model from before. We won't go into detail on KL-divergence, but there is a more detailed explanation in appendix~\\ref{app:kl}.\nSo, the two formulas look almost identical except that in the generalized formula we have a probability of a word given by a query language model. Still, we sum over all the words that are in the document, which is all words with non-zero probability for the query language model. Again, this becomes a generalization of summing over all the matching query words. We can recover the original query likelihood formula by simply setting the query language model to be the relative frequency of a word in the query, which eliminates the query length term $n=|q|$ which is a constant.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:querymod} shows that we first estimate a document language model, then we estimate a query language model and we compute the KL-divergence, often denoted by $D(\\cdot||\\cdot)$. We compute a language model from the documents containing the query terms called the feedback language model $\\theta_F$. This feedback language model is similar to the positive centroid $C_r$ in Rocchio feedback. This model can be combined with the original query language model using a linear interpolation, which produces an updated model, again just like Rocchio.\nWe have a parameter $\\alpha\\in[0,1]$ that controls the strength of the feedback documents. If $\\alpha=0$, there is no feedback; if $\\alpha=1$, we receive full feedback and ignore the original query. Of course, these extremes are generally not desirable. The main question is how to compute this $\\theta_F$.", "We can treat this feedback mixture model as a single distribution in that we can still ask it for words, and it will still give us a word in a random way (according to the underlying models). Which word will show up depends on both the topic distribution and background distribution. In addition, it would also depend on the mixing parameter $\\lambda$; if $\\lambda$ is high, it's going to prefer the background distribution. Conversely, if $\\lambda$ is very small, we're going to use only our topic words. Once we're thinking this way, we can do exactly the same as what we did before by using MLE to adjust this model and set the parameters to best explain the data. The difference, however, is that we are not asking this model alone to explain this; rather, we're going to ask the whole mixture model to explain the data. As a result, it doesn't have to assign high probabilities towards words like \\emph{the}, which is exactly what we want. It would then assign high probabilities to other words that are common in the topic distribution but not having high probability in the background distribution. As a result, this topic model must assign high probabilities to the words common in the feedback documents yet not to words that are common across the whole collection. Mathematically, we have to compute the log likelihood of the feedback documents $F$ with another parameter $\\lambda$, which denotes noise in the feedback documents. We assume it will be fixed to some value. Assuming it's fixed, then we only have word probabilities $\\theta$ as parameters, just like in the simplest unigram language model. This gives us the following formula to estimate the feedback language model: We choose this probability distribution $\\theta_F$ to maximize the log likelihood of the feedback documents under our model. This is the same idea as the maximum likelihood estimator. Here though, the mathematical problem is to solve this optimization problem. We could try all possible $\\theta$ values and select the one that gives the whole expression the maximum probability. Once we have done that, we obtain this $\\theta_F$ that can be interpolated with the original query model to do feedback.

First, we initialize all the (unknown) parameters values randomly.

This prediction (\\ie, E-step) essentially helps us (probabilistically) separate words generated by the two distributions. Finally, we will collect all the probabilistically allocated counts of words belonging to our topic word distribution and normalize them into probabilities, which serve as an improved estimate of the parameters. The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. A main idea of EM is to leverage such hidden variables to simplify the computation of the ML estimate since knowing the values of these hidden variables makes the ML estimate trivial to compute; we can pool together all the words whose $z$ values are 0 and normalize their counts. Knowing $z$ values can potentially help simplify the task of computing the ML estimate, and EM exploits this fact by alternating the E-step and M-step in each iteration so as to improve the parameter estimate in a hill-climbing manner. Specifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.", "Once we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words.

Similarly, the adjusted count for \\emph{text} would be $4\\cdot 0.71$. After the M-step, $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ would be much higher than $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ as shown in the table (shown in the first column under Iteration 2). Those words that are believed to have come from the topic word distribution $\\theta_d$ according to the E-step would have a higher probability. This new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values, leading to a new generation of probabilities for the $z$ values, which can be fed into another M-step to generate yet another generation of potentially improved estimate of $\\theta_d$. In the last row of the table, we show the log-likelihood after each iteration. Since each iteration would lead to a different generation of parameter estimates, it would also give a different value for the log-likelihood function. These log-likelihood values are all negative because the probability is between 0 and 1, which becomes a negative value after the logarithm transformation. We see that after each iteration, the log-likelihood value is increasing, showing that the EM algorithm is iteratively improving the estimated parameter values in a hill-climbing manner.", "The EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm. It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function.", "Second, in the E-step, it would attempt to infer the values of the hidden variables based on the current generation of parameters, and obtain a probability distribution of hidden variables over all possible values of these hidden variables. Intuitively, this is to take a good guess of the values of the hidden variables. Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values. This process is repeated until convergence to a local maximum of the likelihood function."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["Specifically, given all the parameters, can we infer the distribution a word is from? So let's assume that we actually know tentative probabilities for these words in theta sub d. So now all the parameters are known for this mystery model as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-infer}. Now let's consider word, like a text. So the question is, do you think text is more likely, having been generated from theta sub d or from theta sub b? So, in other words, we are to infer which distribution has been used to generate this text. Now, this inference process is a typical of basing an inference situation, where we have some prior about these two distributions.", "So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in.", "From here to here we have an improvement. So in this setting we have assumed the two numerals have equal probabilities and the background model is null. So what are the relevance of the statistics? Well these are the word counts. So assume we have just four words, and their counts are like this. And this is our background model that assigns high probabilities to common words like the. And in the first iteration, you can picture what will happen. Well first we initialize all the values. So here, this probability that we're interested in is normalized into a uniform distribution of all the words. And then the E-step would give us a guess of the distribution that has been used. That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm.", "And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point. And that's why EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function.", "Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values. This process is repeated until convergence to a local maximum of the likelihood function."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in.", "So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm. As you can see in the last row where we show the log-likelihood, and the likelihood is increasing as we do the iteration.", "And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-6383817": 1, "wikipedia-18443992": 1, "wikipedia-45454942": 1, "wikipedia-25868700": 1, "wikipedia-18712065": 1, "wikipedia-60827351": 1, "wikipedia-25716941": 1, "wikipedia-37868330": 1, "wikipedia-36216526": 1, "wikipedia-180855": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/14": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/13": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/web-search/links.jsonl/11": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/background/prob-stats.jsonl/20": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/prob-models.jsonl/11": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/nlp/exercises.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/bayesian-stats.jsonl/23": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-6383817": 1, "wikipedia-18443992": 1, "wikipedia-45454942": 1, "wikipedia-25868700": 1, "wikipedia-18712065": 1, "wikipedia-60827351": 1, "wikipedia-25716941": 1, "wikipedia-37868330": 1, "wikipedia-36216526": 1, "wikipedia-180855": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/14": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/13": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/web-search/links.jsonl/11": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/background/prob-stats.jsonl/20": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/text-retrieval/prob-models.jsonl/11": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/nlp/exercises.jsonl/0": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/bayesian-stats.jsonl/23": 1}}}

It is an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change to the solution. If the change produces a better solution, another incremental change is made to the new solution, and so on until no further improvements can be found.\nFor example, hill climbing can be applied to the travelling salesman problem. It is easy to find an initial solution that visits all the cities but will likely be very poor compared to the optimal solution. The algorithm starts with such a solution and makes small improvements to it, such as switching the order in which two cities are visited. Eventually, a much shorter route is likely to be obtained.\nHill climbing finds optimal solutions for convex problems \u2013 for other problems it will find only local optima (solutions that cannot be improved upon by any neighboring configurations), which are not necessarily the best possible solution (the global optimum) out of all possible solutions (the search space).

To attempt to avoid getting stuck in local optima, one could use restarts (i.e. repeated local search), or more complex schemes based on iterations (like iterated local search), or on memory (like reactive search optimization and tabu search), or on memory-less stochastic modifications (like simulated annealing).\nThe relative simplicity of the algorithm makes it a popular first choice amongst optimizing algorithms. It is used widely in artificial intelligence, for reaching a goal state from a starting node. Different choices for next nodes and starting nodes are used in related algorithms. Although more advanced algorithms such as simulated annealing or tabu search may give better results, in some situations hill climbing works just as well.

Mapping from the parameter space to the real line, the likelihood function describes a hypersurface whose peak, if it exists, represents the combination of model parameter values that maximize the probability of drawing the sample actually obtained. The procedure for obtaining these arguments of the maximum of the likelihood function is known as maximum likelihood estimation, which for computational convenience is usually done using the natural logarithm of the likelihood, known as the log-likelihood function. Additionally, the shape and curvature of the likelihood surface represent information about the stability of the estimates, which is why the likelihood function is often plotted as part of a statistical analysis.", "maximize a differentiable function is to find the stationary points (the points where the derivative is zero); since the derivative of a sum is just the sum of the derivatives, but the derivative of a product requires the product rule, it is easier to compute the stationary points of the log-likelihood of independent events than for the likelihood of independent events.\n\nThe equations defined by the stationary point of the score function serve as estimating equations for the maximum likelihood estimator.\n\nThe second derivative evaluated at formula_77, known as Fisher information, determines the curvature of the likelihood surface, and thus indicates the precision of the estimate.\n\nThe log-likelihood is also particularly useful for exponential families of distributions, which include many of the common parametric probability distributions. The probability distribution function (and thus likelihood function) for exponential families contain products of factors involving exponentiation. The logarithm of such a function is a sum of products, again easier to differentiate than the original function.\n\nThe term \"likelihood\" has been in use in English since at least late Middle English. Its formal use to refer to a specific function in mathematical statistics was proposed by Ronald Fisher, in two research papers published in 1921 and 1922. The 1921 paper introduced what is today called a \"likelihood interval\"; the 1922 paper introduced the term \"method of maximum likelihood.\" Quoting Fisher:\nThe concept of likelihood should not be confused with probability as mentioned by Sir Ronald Fisher \"I stress this because in spite of the emphasis that I have always laid upon the difference between probability and likelihood there is still a tendency to treat likelihood as though it were a sort of probability. The first result is thus that there are two different measures of rational belief appropriate to different cases. Knowing the population we can express our incomplete knowledge of, or expectation of, the sample in terms of probability; knowing the sample we can express our incomplete knowledge of the population in terms of likelihood.\"\n\nIn Bayesian inference, although one can speak about the likelihood of any proposition or random variable given another random variable: for example the likelihood of a parameter value or of a statistical model (see marginal likelihood), given specified data or other evidence, the likelihood function remains the same entity, with the additional interpretations of (i) a conditional density of the data given the parameter (since the parameter is then a random variable) and (ii) a measure or amount of information brought by the data about the parameter value or even the model.\n\nIn frequentist statistics, the likelihood function is itself a statistic that summarizes a single sample from a population, whose calculated value depends on a choice of several parameters \"\u03b8\" ... \"\u03b8\", where \"p\" is the count of parameters in some already-selected statistical model.

Since some words might have repeated occurrences, when we use a product over the unique words we must also incorporate the count of a word $w_i$ in document $d$, which is denoted by $c(w_i,d)$. Although the product is taken over the entire vocabulary, it is clear that if a word did not occur in the document, it would have a zero count ($c(w_i,d)=0$), and that corresponding term would be essentially absent in the formula, thus the product is still essentially over"], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/26": ["And then we'll be thinking about the microfunction or write down the microfunction to capture more formally how likely a data point will be obtained from this model.

Well, this is just the probability of generating this whole document, that given such a model.

Well, the product is over different positions of words in the document. Now when we do this transformation, we then would need to introduce a counter function here. This denotes the count of word one in document and similarly this is the count of words of n in the document because these words might have repeated occurrences. You can also see if a word did not occur in the document. It will have a zero count, therefore that corresponding term will disappear.

Essentially, we are only considering the words in the query because if a word is not in the query, its contribution to the sum would be zero."], "textbook/textdatabook/feedback/lm-feedback.jsonl/5": ["Recall that we derive the query likelihood ranking function by making various assumptions, such as term independence. As a basic retrieval function, that family of functions worked well. However, if we think about incorporating feedback information, it is not immediately obvious how to modify query likelihood to perform feedback. Many times, the feedback information is additional information about the query, but since we assumed that the query is generated by assembling words from an ideal document language model, we don't have an easy way to add this additional information.\nAs a result, we have a way to generalize the query likelihood function that will allow us to include feedback documents more easily: it's called a \\textbf{Kullback-Leibler divergence retrieval model}, or \\emph{KL-divergence retrieval model} for short. This model actually makes the query likelihood retrieval function much closer to the vector space model. Despite this, the new form of the language model retrieval can still be regarded as a generalization of query likelihood (in that it covers query likelihood without feedback as a special case).\n\nThe KL-divergence (also called cross entropy) retrieval model generalizes the query term frequency into a probabilistic distribution. This distribution is the only difference, which is able to characterize the user's query in a more general way. This query language model can be estimated in many different ways---including using feedback information. This method is called KL-divergence because this can be interpreted as measuring the divergence (\\ie, difference) between two distributions; one is the query model $p(w|\\hat{\\theta}_Q)$ and the other is the document language model from before.", "If we use a maximum likelihood estimate, this model is forced to assign high probabilities to a word like \\emph{the}, because it occurs so frequently. In order to reduce its probability in this model, we have to have another model which is based on content words (\\ie, words that are specific to the query). Thus, it's not appropriate to use the background language model to achieve this goal because this model will still assign high probabilities to these common words.\n\nOnce we're thinking this way, we can do exactly the same as what we did before by using MLE to adjust this model and set the parameters to best explain the data. The difference, however, is that we are not asking this model alone to explain this; rather, we're going to ask the whole mixture model to explain the data. As a result, it doesn't have to assign high probabilities towards words like \\emph{the}, which is exactly what we want. It would then assign high probabilities to other words that are common in the topic distribution but not having high probability in the background distribution. As a result, this topic model must assign high probabilities to the words common in the feedback documents yet not to words that are common across the whole collection.\n\nMathematically, we have to compute the log likelihood of the feedback documents $F$ with another parameter $\\lambda$, which denotes noise in the feedback documents. We assume it will be fixed to some value. Assuming it's fixed, then we only have word probabilities $\\theta$ as parameters, just like in the simplest unigram language model. This gives us the following formula to estimate the feedback language model:\n\nWe choose this probability distribution $\\theta_F$ to maximize the log likelihood of the feedback documents under our model. This is the same idea as the maximum likelihood estimator. Here though, the mathematical problem is to solve this optimization problem. We could try all possible $\\theta$ values and select the one that gives the whole expression the maximum probability. Once we have done that, we obtain this $\\theta_F$ that can be interpolated with the original query model to do feedback."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": ["According to our mixture model, we can imagine that the words in the text data can be partitioned into two groups. One group will be explained (generated) by the background model. The other group will be explained by the unknown topical model (the topic word distribution). The challenge in computing the ML estimate is that we do not know this partition due to the possibility of generating a word using either of the two distributions in the mixture model.", "The posterior probability $p(z=0|w=\\text{text}) $ formally captures our guess about which distribution has been used to generate the word \\emph{text}, and it is seen to be proportional to the product of the prior $p(\\theta_d)$ and the likelihood $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$, which is intuitively very meaningful since in order to generate \\emph{text} from $\\theta_d$, we must first choose $\\theta_d$ (as opposed to $\\theta_B$), which is captured by $p(\\theta_d)$, and then obtain word \\emph{text} from the selected $\\theta_d$, which is captured by $p(w|\\theta_d)$. Understanding how to make such a Bayesian inference of which distribution has been used to generate a word based on a set of tentative parameter values is very crucial for understanding the EM algorithm. This is essentially the E-step of the EM algorithm where we use Bayes' rule to partition data and allocate all the data points among all the component models in the mixture model.", "The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values.", "In the last row of the table, we show the log-likelihood after each iteration. Since each iteration would lead to a different generation of parameter estimates, it would also give a different value for the log-likelihood function. These log-likelihood values are all negative because the probability is between 0 and 1, which becomes a negative value after the logarithm transformation. We see that after each iteration, the log-likelihood value is increasing, showing that the EM algorithm is iteratively improving the estimated parameter values in a hill-climbing manner.", "Next, we provide some intuitive explanation why the EM algorithm will converge to a local maximum in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-opt}. Here we show the parameter $\\theta_d$ on the X-axis, and the Y-axis denotes the likelihood function value. This is an over-simplification since $\\theta_d$ is an $M$-dimensional vector, but the one-dimensional view makes it much easier to understand the EM algorithm. We see that in general, the original likelihood function (as a function of $\\theta_d$) may have multiple local maxima. The goal of computing the ML estimate is to find the global maximum, \\ie, the $\\theta_d$ value that makes the likelihood function reach it global maximum. \nThe EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm. It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. You might wonder why we don't work on finding an improved parameter value directly on the original likelihood function. Indeed, it is possible to do that, but in the EM algorithm, the auxiliary function is usually much easier to optimize than the original likelihood function, so in this sense, it reduces the problem into a somewhat simpler one. Although the auxiliary function is generally easier to optimize, it does not always have an analytical solution, which means that the maximization of the auxiliary function may itself require another iterative process, which would be embedded in the overall iterative process of the EM algorithm.", "This process is repeated until convergence to a local maximum of the likelihood function. Note that although the likelihood function is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum, there is no guarantee that the parameters to be estimated always have a stable convergence to a particular set of values."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["In this lecture,\nwe're going to continue the discussion\nof probabilistic topic models.\nIn particular,\nwe're going to introduce the EM algorithm.\nWhich is a family of useful algorithms for\ncomputing the maximum life or\nestimate of mixture models.\nSo, this is now a familiar scenario\nof using two components, the mixture\nmodel to try to fact out the background\nwords from one topic or word distribution.\nYeah.\nSo, we're interested in computing\nthis estimate and\nwe're going to try to adjust these\nprobability values to maximize\nthe probability of the observed documents.\nAnd know that we're assumed all\nthe other parameters are known.\nSo, the only thing unknown is these water\nproperties, this given by zero something.\nAnd in this lecture, we're going to look\ninto how to compute this maximum like or\nestimate.\nNow this started with the idea of\nseparating the words in\nthe text data into two groups.\nOne group will be explained\nby the background model.\nThe other group will be explained\nby the unknown topical order.\nAfter all this is the basic\nidea of the mixture model.\nBut, suppose we actually know which\nword is from which distribution.\nSo that would mean, for example,\nthese words, the, is, and\nwe, are known to be from this\nbackground origin, distribution.\nOn the other hand,\nthe other words, text mining,\nclustering, etcetera are known to be\nfrom the topic word, distribution as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-known-dist}.\nIf you can see the color,\nthat these are showing blue.\nThese blue words are, they are assumed\nto be from the topic word, distribution.\nIf we already know how\nto separate these words.\nThen the problem of estimating\nthe word distribution\nwould be extremely simple, right?\nIf you think about this for\na moment, you'll realize that, well,\nwe can simply take all these\nwords that are known to be from\nthis word distribution,\nsee that's a d and normalize them.\nSo indeed this problem would be\nvery easy to solve if we had known\nwhich words are from which\nit is written precisely.\nAnd this is in fact,\nmaking this model no longer a mystery\nmodel because we can already observe which\nof these distribution has been used\nto generate which part of the data.\nSo we, actually go back to the single\norder distribution problem.\nAnd in this case, let's call these words\nthat are known to be from theta d,\na pseudo document of d prime.\nAnd now all we have to do is\njust normalize these word\naccounts for each word, w sub i.\nAnd that's fairly straightforward,\nand it's just dictated by\nthe maximum estimator.\nNow, this idea, however,\ndoesn't work because we in practice,\ndon't really know which word\nis from which distribution.\nBut this gives us an idea of perhaps\nwe can guess which word is\nfrom which distribution.\nSpecifically, given all the parameters,\ncan we infer the distribution\na word is from?\nSo let's assume that we actually\nknow tentative probabilities for\nthese words in theta sub d.\nSo now all the parameters are known for\nthis mystery model as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-infer}.\nNow let's consider word, like a text.\nSo the question is,\ndo you think text is more likely,\nhaving been generated from theta sub d or\nfrom theta sub b?\nSo, in other words,\nwe are to infer which distribution\nhas been used to generate this text.\nNow, this inference process is a typical\nof basing an inference situation,\nwhere we have some prior about\nthese two distributions.\nSo can you see what is our prior here?\nWell, the prior here is the probability\nof each distribution, right.\nSo the prior is given by\nthese two probabilities.\nIn this case, the prior is saying\nthat each model is equally likely.\nBut we can imagine perhaps\na different apply is possible.\nSo this is called a pry\nbecause this is our guess\nof which distribution has been\nused to generate the word.\nBefore we even observed the word.\nSo that's why we call it a pry.\nIf we don't observe the word we don't\nknow what word has been observed.\nOur best guess is to say,\nwell, they're equally likely.\nSo it's just like flipping a coin.", "And if we use base rule to combine the prior and the theta likelihood, what we will end up with is to combine the prior with the likelihood that you see here. Which is basically the probability of the word text from each distribution. And we see that in both cases text is possible. Note that even in the background it is still possible, it just has a very small probability. So intuitively what would be your guess seeing this case? Now if you're like many others, you would guess text is probably from c.subd it's more likely from c.subd, why? And you will probably see that it's because text has a much higher probability here by the C now sub D than by the background model which has a very small probability. And by this we're going to say well, text is more likely from theta sub d. So you see our guess of which distributing has been used with the generated text would depend on how high the probability of the data, the text, is in each word distribution. We can do tentative guess that distribution that gives is a word higher probability. And this is likely to maximize the likelihood. All right, so we are going to choose a word that has a higher likelihood. So, in other words we are going to compare these two probabilities of the word given by each of these distributions. But our guess must also be affected by the prior. So we also need to compare these two priors. Why? Because imagine if we adjust these probabilities. We're going to say, the probability of choosing a background model is almost 100 Now if we have that kind of strong prior, then that would affect your gas. You might think, well, wait a moment, maybe texter could have been from the background as well. Although the probability is very small here the prior is very high. So in the end, we have to combine the two. And the base formula provides us a solid and principle way of making this kind of guess to quantify that. So more specifically, let's think about the probability that this word text has been generated in fact from theta sub d. Well, in order for text to be generated from theta sub d, two things must happen. First, the theta sub d must have been selected. So, we have the selection probability here. And secondly we also have to actually have observed the text from the distribution. So, when we multiply the two together, we get the probability that text has in fact been generated from zero sub d. Similarly, for the background model and the probability of generating text is another product of similar form. Now we also introduced late in the variable z here to denote whether the word is from the background or the topic. When z is 0, it means it's from the topic, theta sub d. When it's 1, it means it's from the background, theta sub B. So now we have the probability that text is generated from each, then we can simply normalize them to have estimate of the probability that the word text is from theta sub d or from theta sub B. And equivalently the probability that Z is equal to zero, given that the observed evidence is text. So this is application of base rule. But this step is very crucial for understanding the EM hours. Because if we can do this, then we would be able to first, initialize the parameter values somewhat randomly. And then, we're going to take a guess of these Z values and all, which distributing has been used to generate which word. And the initialize the parameter values would allow us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which allows us to apply Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. And this prediction essentially helped us to separate words from the two distributions. Although we can't separate them for sure, but we can separate then probabilistically as shown here.", "As you can see in the last row where we show the log-likelihood, and the likelihood is increasing as we do the iteration. And note that these log-likelihood is negative because the probability is between 0 and 1 when you take a logarithm, it becomes a negative value. Now what's also interesting is, you'll note the last column. And these are the inverted word split. And these are the probabilities that a word is believed to have come from one distribution, in this case the topical distribution, all right. And you might wonder whether this would be also useful. Because our main goal is to estimate these word distributions. So this is our primary goal.", "On the y axis we see the likelihood function. So this curve is the original likelihood function, and this is the one that we hope to maximize. And we hope to find a c0 value at this point to maximize this. But in the case of Mitsumoto we can not easily find an analytic solution to the problem. So, we have to resolve the numerical errors, and the EM algorithm is such an algorithm. It's a Hill-Climb algorithm. That would mean you start with some random guess. Let's say you start from here, that's your starting point. And then you try to improve this by moving this to another point where you can have a higher likelihood. So that's the ideal hill climbing. And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. To summarize in this lecture we introduced the EM algorithm. This is a general algorithm for computing maximum maximum likelihood estimate of all kinds of models, so not just for our simple model. And it's a hill-climbing algorithm, so it can only converge to a local maximum and it will depend on initial points."], "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/12": ["The main idea of the EM algorithm is to ``augment'' our data with some latent variables so that the ``complete'' data has a much simpler likelihood function---simpler for the purpose of finding a maxima.

It is equal to the joint probability distribution of the random sample evaluated at the given observations, and it is, thus, solely a function of parameters that index the family of those probability distributions.\nMapping from the parameter space to the real line, the likelihood function describes a hypersurface whose peak, if it exists, represents the combination of model parameter values that maximize the probability of drawing the sample actually obtained. The procedure for obtaining these arguments of the maximum of the likelihood function is known as maximum likelihood estimation, which for computational convenience is usually done using the natural logarithm of the likelihood, known as the log-likelihood function. Additionally, the shape and curvature of the likelihood surface represent information about the stability of the estimates, which is why the likelihood function is often plotted as part of a statistical analysis.\nThe case for using likelihood was first made by R. A. Fisher, who believed it to be a self-contained framework for statistical modelling and inference. Later, Barnard and Birnbaum led a school of thought that advocated the likelihood principle, postulating that all relevant information for inference is contained in the likelihood function. But even in frequentist and Bayesian statistics, the likelihood function plays a fundamental role.", "The concept of likelihood should not be confused with probability as mentioned by Sir Ronald Fisher \"I stress this because in spite of the emphasis that I have always laid upon the difference between probability and likelihood there is still a tendency to treat likelihood as though it were a sort of probability.

Despite this, the new form of the language model retrieval can still be regarded as a generalization of query likelihood (in that it covers query likelihood without feedback as a special case).

On top, we have the query likelihood retrieval function. The KL-divergence (also called cross entropy) retrieval model generalizes the query term frequency into a probabilistic distribution. This distribution is the only difference, which is able to characterize the user's query in a more general way. This query language model can be estimated in many different ways---including using feedback information. This method is called KL-divergence because this can be interpreted as measuring the divergence (\\ie, difference) between two distributions; one is the query model $p(w|\\hat{\\theta}_Q)$ and the other is the document language model from before. We won't go into detail on KL-divergence, but there is a more detailed explanation in appendix~\\ref{app:kl}.\nSo, the two formulas look almost identical except that in the generalized formula we have a probability of a word given by a query language model. Still, we sum over all the words that are in the document, which is all words with non-zero probability for the query language model. Again, this becomes a generalization of summing over all the matching query words.

Conversely, if\n$\\lambda$ is very small, we're going to use only our topic words.\nOnce we're thinking this way, we can do exactly the same as what we did before\nby using MLE to adjust this model and set the parameters to best explain the\ndata. The difference, however, is that we are not asking this model alone to\nexplain this; rather, we're going to ask the whole mixture model to explain the\ndata. As a result, it doesn't have to assign high probabilities towards words\nlike \\emph{the}, which is exactly what we want. It would then assign high\nprobabilities to other words that are common in the topic distribution but not\nhaving high probability in the background distribution. As a result, this topic\nmodel must assign high probabilities to the words common in the feedback\ndocuments yet not to words that are common across the whole collection.\nMathematically, we have to compute the log likelihood of the feedback documents\n$F$ with another parameter $\\lambda$, which denotes noise in the feedback\ndocuments. We assume it will be fixed to some value. Assuming it's fixed, then\nwe only have word probabilities $\\theta$ as parameters, just like in the\nsimplest unigram language model. This gives us the following formula to estimate\nthe feedback language model:\nWe choose this probability distribution $\\theta_F$ to maximize the log\nlikelihood of the feedback documents under our model. This is the same idea as\nthe maximum likelihood estimator. Here though, the mathematical problem is to\nsolve this optimization problem. We could try all possible $\\theta$ values and\nselect the one that gives the whole expression the maximum probability. Once we\nhave done that, we obtain this $\\theta_F$ that can be interpolated with the\noriginal query model to do feedback."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": ["Recall that we have assumed both $p(w|\\theta_B)$ and $p(\\theta_B)$ are already given, so the only ``free'' parameters in our model are $p(w|\\theta_d)$ for all the words subject to the constraint that they sum to one. This is illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-known-dist}. Intuitively, when we compute the ML estimate, we would be exploring the space of all possible values for the word distribution $\\theta_d$ until we find a set of values that would maximize the probability of the observed documents.\n\nAccording to our mixture model, we can imagine that the words in the text data can be partitioned into two groups. One group will be explained (generated) by the background model. The other group will be explained by the unknown topical model (the topic word distribution). The challenge in computing the ML estimate is that we do not know this partition due to the possibility of generating a word using either of the two distributions in the mixture model.\n\nIf we actually know which word is from which distribution, computation of the ML estimate would be trivial as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-known-dist}, where $d'$ is used to denote the pseudo document that is composed of all the words in document $d$ that are known to be generated by $\\theta_d$, and the ML estimate of $\\theta_d$ is seen to be simply the normalized word frequency in this pseudo document $d'$. That is, we can simply pool together all the words generated from $\\theta_d$, compute the count of each word, and then normalize the count by the total counts of all the words in such a pseudo document. In such a case, our mixture model is really just two independent unigram language models, which can thus be estimated separately based on the data points generated by each of them.\n\nUnfortunately, the real situation is such that we don't really know which word is from which distribution. The main idea of the EM algorithm is to guess (infer) which word is from which distribution based on a tentative estimate of parameters, and then use the inferred partitioning of words to improve the estimate of parameters, which, in turn, enables improved inference of the partitioning, leading to an iterative hill-climbing algorithm to improve the estimate of the parameters until hitting a local maximum. In each iteration, it would invoke an E-step followed by an M-step, which will be explained in more detail.\n\nFor now, let's assume we have a tentative estimate of all the parameters. How can we infer which of the two distributions a word has been generated from? Consider a specific word such as \\emph{text}. Is it more likely from $\\theta_d$ or $\\theta_B$? To answer this question, we compute the conditional probability $p(\\theta_d|\\text{text})$. The value of $p(\\theta_d|\\text{text})$ would depend on two factors:\n\nOur intuition can be rigorously captured by using Bayes' rule to infer $p(\\theta_d|\\text{text})$, where we essentially compare the product $p(\\theta_d)p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ with the product $p(\\theta_B)p(\\text{text}|\\theta_B)$ to see whether \\emph{text} is more likely", "Such a prior is then updated by incorporating the data likelihood $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ and $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_B)$ so that we would favor a distribution that gives \\emph{text} a higher probability. In the example shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-infer}, our prior says that each of the two models is equally likely; thus, it is a non-informative prior (one with no bias). As a result, our inference of which distribution has been used to generate a word would solely be based on $p(w|\\theta_d)$ and $p(w|\\theta_B)$. Since $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ is much larger than $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_B)$, we can conclude that $\\theta_d$ is much more likely the distribution that has been used to generate \\emph{text}. In general, our prior may be biased toward a particular distribution. Indeed, a heavily-biased prior can even dominate over the data likelihood to essentially dictate the decision. For example, imagine our prior says $p(\\theta_B)=0.99999999$, then our inference result would say that \\emph{text} is more likely generated by $\\theta_B$ than by $\\theta_d$ even though $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ is much higher than $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_B)$, due to the very strong prior. Bayes' Rule provides us a principled way of combining the prior and data likelihood.", "The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values.", "The Y-axis denotes the likelihood function value. This is an over-simplification since $\\theta_d$ is an $M$-dimensional vector, but the one-dimensional view makes it much easier to understand the EM algorithm. We see that in general, the original likelihood function (as a function of $\\theta_d$) may have multiple local maxima. The goal of computing the ML estimate is to find the global maximum, \\ie, the $\\theta_d$ value that makes the likelihood function reach it global maximum.\nThe EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm. It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum.", "This process is repeated until convergence to a local maximum of the likelihood function. Note that although the likelihood function is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum, there is no guarantee that the parameters to be estimated always have a stable convergence to a particular set of values. That is, the parameters may oscillate even though the likelihood is increasing."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["And if we use base rule to combine the prior and the theta likelihood, what we will end up with is to combine the prior with the likelihood that you see here. Which is basically the probability of the word text from each distribution. And we see that in both cases text is possible. Note that even in the background it is still possible, it just has a very small probability. So intuitively what would be your guess seeing this case? Now if you're like many others, you would guess text is probably from c.subd it's more likely from c.subd, why? And you will probably see that it's because text has a much higher probability here by the C now sub D than by the background model which has a very small probability. And by this we're going to say well, text is more likely from theta sub d. So you see our guess of which distributing has been used with the generated text would depend on how high the probability of the data, the text, is in each word distribution. We can do tentative guess that distribution that gives is a word higher probability. And this is likely to maximize the likelihood. All right, so we are going to choose a word that has a higher likelihood. So, in other words we are going to compare these two probabilities of the word given by each of these distributions.", "So this curve is the original\nlikelihood function,\nand this is the one that\nwe hope to maximize.\nAnd we hope to find a c0 value\nat this point to maximize this.\nBut in the case of Mitsumoto we can\nnot easily find an analytic solution\nto the problem.\nSo, we have to resolve\nthe numerical errors, and\nthe EM algorithm is such an algorithm.\nIt's a Hill-Climb algorithm.\nThat would mean you start\nwith some random guess.\nLet's say you start from here,\nthat's your starting point.\nAnd then you try to improve\nthis by moving this to\nanother point where you can\nhave a higher likelihood.\nSo that's the ideal hill climbing.\nAnd in the EM algorithm, the way we\nachieve this is to do two things.\nFirst, we'll fix a lower\nbound of likelihood function.\nSo this is the lower bound.\nSee here.\nAnd once we fit the lower bound,\nwe can then maximize the lower bound.\nAnd of course, the reason why this works,\nis because the lower bound\nis much easier to optimize.\nSo we know our current guess is here.\nAnd by maximizing the lower bound,\nwe'll move this point to the top.\nTo here.\nRight?\nAnd we can then map to the original\nlikelihood function, we find this point.\nBecause it's a lower bound, we are\nguaranteed to improve this guess, right?\nBecause we improve our lower bound and\nthen the original likelihood\ncurve which is above this lower bound\nwill definitely be improved as well.\nSo we already know it's\nimproving the lower bound.\nSo we definitely improve this\noriginal likelihood function,\nwhich is above this lower bound."], "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/12": ["The main idea of the EM algorithm is to ``augment'' our data with some latent variables so that the ``complete'' data has a much simpler likelihood function---simpler for the purpose of finding  a maxima.

In such a case, log-likelihood of held-out data and even topic coherency is not a concern if the classification accuracy improves---though model interpretability may be compromised if topics are not human-distinguishable."], "textbook/textdatabook/categorization/evaluation.jsonl/2": ["As with information retrieval evaluation, we can use precision, recall, and $F_1$ score by considering true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. We are also usually concerned about accuracy, which is defined as the number of correct categorization decisions made by the system divided by the total number of categorization decisions made by the system.  Since the accuracy measure does not distinguish different types of categorization errors, it is not appropriate to use it on a data set that has skewed distributions of instances in different classes. For example, in a binary categorization problem, if one category is much more popular than the other, than a trivial baseline that simply puts all instances in the category would have a pretty high categorization accuracy. To more appropriately evaluate such a categorization task, we can examine the categorization performance for each category. For example, we may treat the categorization results for each category as ``retrieval'' results for a query corresponding to the category and apply typical measures used in retrieval such as precision, recall and F measure to quantify the performance in a per-category manner."], "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/ranked-list.jsonl/7": ["We saw that precision and recall are the two basic ways to\nmeasure the performance of a search result.\nBut, as we talked about in depth in chapter~\\ref{chap:access},\nthe text retrieval problem is a \\emph{ranking} problem, not a classification\none. Thus we need to evaluate the quality of a ranked list as opposed to whether\na relevant document was returned anywhere in the results.\nHow can we use precision and recall to evaluate a ranked list? Naturally, we\nwill have to look at precision and recall at different cutoffs since a ranked\nlist of relevant documents is determined by where the user stops browsing. If we\nassume the user sequentially browses the list of results, the user would stop at\nsome point. That point would determine the size of the set. Therefore, that's\nthe most important cutoff that we have to consider when we compute the\nprecision-recall.\nWithout knowing where exactly the user would stop, we have to consider all the\npossible positions where they might stop. A \\textbf{precision-recall} curve does\nexactly this as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:prcurve}\n}", "The problem is that we might see a case like the right graph---this actually happens quite often where the two curves cross each other. In this case, which one is better? This is a real problem that you might actually have to face. Suppose you build a search engine and you have an old algorithm that's shown here in blue as system B. Then, you have come up with a new idea and test it with results shown in red as system A. The question is, is your new method better than the old method? Or, more practically, do you have to replace the algorithm that you're already using in your search engine with another new algorithm? If you make the replacement, the search engine would behave like system A here, whereas if you don't do that, it will be like system B. Now, some users might like system A, while some users might like system B. So what's the difference here? Well, the difference is just that---in the low level of recall, system B is better, but in the high recall region, system A is better. That means it depends on whether the user cares about high recall, or low recall with high precision. Imagine someone is just going to check out what's happening today and wants to find out something relevant in the news. Which system is better for that task? In this case, system B is better because the user is unlikely to examine many results; \\ie, the user doesn't care about high recall, only the first few results being useful. On the other hand, if a user wants to determine whether an idea has been thought of before, they will want to emphasize high recall so that they see as many relevant documents as possible and don't miss the chance to find the idea. Therefore, those users would favor system A.\nBut this brings us back to the original question: \\emph{which one is better?} Again, this actually depends on the users, or more precisely, the users' task. You may not necessarily be able to come up with one number that would accurately depict the performance. You have to look at the overall picture. Despite this, it can be beneficial to have one number to compare the systems so that we can easily make a lot of different system comparisons; we need a number to summarize the range of precision-recall values. One way is to look at the area underneath the curve---the average precision. Basically, we're going to take a look at every different recall point and consider the precision.\nThe precisions we add up correspond to retrieving the first relevant document, the second, and so on. In the example in the figure, we missed many relevant documents so in all of these cases we assume that they have zero precision. Finally, we take the average and divide it by ten, which is the total number of relevant documents in the collection. Note that we're \\emph{not} dividing this sum by four (which is the number of retrieved relevant documents). Dividing by four is a common mistake; this favors a system that would retrieve very few documents, making the denominator very small. In the correct formula, the denominator is ten, the total number of relevant documents. This will allow us to compute the area under the PR-curve, combining recall and precision.\nMathematically, we can define \\textbf{average precision} on a ranked list $L$ where $|L|=n$ as where $p(i)$ denotes the rank of relevant documents in $L$, and $Rel$ is the set of all relevant documents in the collection. For example, if $D_i$ is not relevant, it contributes zero to the sum as $p(i)=0$. If $D_i$ is relevant, we divide the number of relevant documents we've seen so far by the current position in the list (which is $i$). If the first relevant document is at the second rank, then $p(2)=\\frac{1}{2}$. If the third relevant document is at the seventh rank, then $p(7)=\\frac{3}{7}$. Let's use this formula to calculate the average precision of the documents returned in Figure~\\ref{fig:prcurve}. Figure~\\ref{fig:ap-calc} shows the calculation.\nThis measure is sensitive to a small change in position of a relevant document. If we move the third or fourth relevant document up, it would increase the averages.

We only showed $p(z=0|w)$, which is needed in our M-step ($p(z=1|w)=1-p(z=0|w)$). Clearly, $p(z=0|w)$ has different values for different words, and this is because these words have different probabilities in the background model and the initialized $\\theta_d$.\nOnce we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words. For example, the count of \\emph{the} is 4, but since $p(z=0|\\text{the})=0.33$, we would obtain a discounted count of \\emph{the}, $4\\cdot 0.33$, when estimating $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ in the M-step.

For example, one talks about \"a Poisson distribution with mean value \u03bb\". The function defining the distribution (the probability mass function) is:\nThis example nicely illustrates the distinction between constants, parameters, and variables. \"e\" is Euler's number, a fundamental mathematical constant. The parameter \u03bb\" is the mean number of observations of some phenomenon in question, a property characteristic of the system. \"k\" is a variable, in this case the number of occurrences of the phenomenon actually observed from a particular sample. If we want to know the probability of observing \"k\" occurrences, we plug it into the function to get formula_11. Without altering the system, we can take multiple samples, which will have a range of values of \"k\", but the system is always characterized by the same \u03bb.\nFor instance, suppose we have a radioactive sample that emits, on average, five particles every ten minutes. We take measurements of how many particles the sample emits over ten-minute periods. The measurements exhibit different values of \"k\", and if the sample behaves according to Poisson statistics, then each value of \"k\" will come up in a proportion given by the probability mass function above. From measurement to measurement, however, \u03bb remains constant at 5. If we do not alter the system, then the parameter \u03bb is unchanged from measurement to measurement; if, on the other hand, we modulate the system by replacing the sample with a more radioactive one, then the parameter \u03bb would increase.\nAnother common distribution is the normal distribution, which has as parameters the mean \u03bc and the variance \u03c3\u00b2.\nIn these above examples, the distributions of the random variables are completely specified by the type of distribution, i.e. Poisson or normal, and the parameter values, i.e. mean and variance.

Assuming that the current estimate of the parameters is $\\theta^{(n)}$, our goal is to find another $\\theta^{(n+1)}$ that can improve the likelihood $L(\\theta)$. Let us consider the difference between the likelihood at a potentially better parameter value $\\theta$ and the likelihood at the current estimate $\\theta^{(n)}$, and relate it with the corresponding difference in the complete likelihood: Our goal is to maximize $L(\\theta)-L(\\theta^{(n)})$, which is equivalent to maximizing $L(\\theta)$. Now take the expectation of this equation w.r.t. the conditional distribution of the hidden variable given the data $X$ and the current estimate of parameters $\\theta^{(n)}$, i.e., $p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)}$.

Intuitively, we use the inferred distribution of $z$ values from the E-step to split the counts of $w$ among all the distributions. The amount of split counts of $w$ that $\\theta_j$ can get is determined based on the inferred likelihood that $w$ is generated by topic $\\theta_j$.

And when we multiply them together, we get the discounted count that's located for topic theta sub j. And when we normalize this over all the topics, we get the distribution of all the topics to indicate the coverage. And similarly, the bottom one is the estimated probability of word for a topic. And in this case we are using exact the same count, you can see this is the same discounted account, ] it tells us to what extend we should allocate this word [INAUDIBLE] but then normalization is different. Because in this case we are interested in the word distribution, so we simply normalize this over all the words. This is different, in contrast here we normalize the amount all the topics.

We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters.

And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from?

Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm.", "So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound.

In the E-step, we have to introduce more hidden variables because we have more topics. Our hidden variable $z$, which is a topic indicator for a word, now would take $k+1$ values $\\{1, 2, ..., k, B\\}$, corresponding to the $k$ topics and the extra background topic. The E-step uses Bayes' Rule to infer the probability of each value for $z$ as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-estep}.", "The M-step is also similar to that in the simple mixture model. We show the equations in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. We see that a key component in the two equations, for re-estimating $\\pi$ and $p(w|\\theta)$ respectively, is $c(w,d)(1-p(z_{d,w}=B)p(z_{d,w}=j)$, which can be interpreted as the allocated counts of $w$ to topic $\\theta_j$. Intuitively, we use the inferred distribution of $z$ values from the E-step to split the counts of $w$ among all the distributions. The amount of split counts of $w$ that $\\theta_j$ can get is determined based on the inferred likelihood that $w$ is generated by topic $\\theta_j$. Once we have such a split count of each word for each distribution, we can easily pool together these split counts to re-estimate both $\\pi$ and $p(w|\\theta)$ as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. To re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$, the probability that document $d$ covers topic $\\theta_j$, we would simply collect all the split counts of words in document $d$ that belong to each $\\theta_j$, and then normalize these counts among all the $k$ topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, we would collect the split counts of a word toward $\\theta_j$ from all the documents in the collection, and then normalize these counts among all the words. Note that the normalizers are very different in these two cases, which are directly related to the constraints we have on these parameters. In the case of re-estimation of $\\pi$, the constraint is that the $\\pi$ values must sum to one for each document, thus our normalizer has been chosen to ensure that the re-estimated values of $\\pi$ indeed sum to one for each document. The same is true for the re-estimation of $p(w|\\theta)$, where our normalizer allows us to obtain a word distribution for each topic. What we observed here is actually generally true when using the EM algorithm. That is, the distribution of the hidden variables computed in the E-step can be used to compute the expected counts of an event, which can then aggregated and normalized appropriately to obtain a re-estimate of the parameters. In the implementation of the EM algorithm, we can thus just keep the counts of various events and then normalize them appropriately to obtain re-estimates for various parameters.

Note that the same word would generally be split in different ways in different documents. Once we split the counts for all the words in this way, we can aggregate the split counts and normalize them. For example, to re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$ (coverage of topic $\theta_j$ in document $d$), the relevant counts would be the counts of words in $d$ that have been allocated to topic $\theta_j$, and the normalizer would be the sum of all such counts over all the topics so that after normalization, we would obtain a probability distribution over all the topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\theta_j)$, the relevant counts are the sum of all the split counts of word $w$ in all the documents. These aggregated counts would then be normalized by the sum of such aggregated counts over all the words in the vocabulary so that after normalization, we again would obtain a distribution, this time over all the words rather than all the topics."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["First, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values. In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in. Okay, so, as I said, the bridge between the two is really the variable z, hidden variable, which indicates how likely this water is from the top water distribution, theta sub p.", "Well first we initialize all the values. So here, this probability that we're interested in is normalized into a uniform distribution of all the words. And then the E-step would give us a guess of the distribution that has been used. That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm.", "And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point. And that's why EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": ["The main idea of the EM algorithm is to guess (infer) which word is from which distribution based on a tentative estimate of parameters, and then use the inferred partitioning of words to improve the estimate of parameters, which, in turn, enables improved inference of the partitioning, leading to an iterative hill-climbing algorithm to improve the estimate of the parameters until hitting a local maximum. In each iteration, it would invoke an E-step followed by an M-step, which will be explained in more detail.", "we will collect all the probabilistically allocated counts of words belonging to our topic word distribution and normalize them into probabilities, which serve as an improved estimate of the parameters. The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values.\nSpecifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.\nIn the M-step, we adjust the count $c(w,d)$ based on $p(z=0|w)$ (\\ie, probability that the word $w$ is indeed from $\\theta_d$) so as to obtain a discounted count $c(w,d)p(z=0|w)$ which can be interpreted as the expected count of the event that word $w$ is generated from $\\theta_B$. Similarly, $\\theta_B$ has its own share of the count, which is $c(w,d)p(z=1|w) = c(w,d)[1-p(z=0|w)]$, and we have showing that all the counts of word $w$ have been split between the two distributions.\nThus, the M-step is simply to normalize these discounted counts for all the words to obtain a probability distribution over all the words, which can then be regarded as our improved estimate of $p(w|\\theta_d)$.", "Thus the M-step is seen to use the $n$-th generation of parameters together with the newly inferred $z$ values to obtain a new $n+1$-th generation of parameters (\\ie, $p^{n+1}(w|\theta_d)$).\nOnce we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words. For example, the count of \\emph{the} is 4, but since $p(z=0|\\text{the})=0.33$, we would obtain a discounted count of \\emph{the}, $4\\cdot 0.33$, when estimating $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ in the M-step. Similarly, the adjusted count for \\emph{text} would be $4\\cdot 0.71$. After the M-step, $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ would be much higher than $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ as shown in the table (shown in the first column under Iteration 2). Those words that are believed to have come from the topic word distribution $\\theta_d$ according to the E-step would have a higher probability. This new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values, leading to a new generation of probabilities for the $z$ values, which can be fed into another M-step to generate yet another generation of potentially improved estimate of $\\theta_d$.", "In our case of the simple mixture model, we did not explicitly compute this auxiliary function in the E-step because the auxiliary function is very simple and as a result, our M-step has an analytical solution, thus we were able to bypass the explicit computation of this auxiliary function and go directly to find a re-estimate of the parameters. Thus in the E-step, we only computed a key component in the auxiliary function, which is the probability that a word has been generated from each of the two distributions, and our M-step directly gives us an analytical solution to the problem of optimizing the auxiliary function, and the solution directly uses the values obtained from the E-step.", "The EM algorithm would then work as follows. First, it would randomly initialize all the parameters to be estimated. Second, in the E-step, it would attempt to infer the values of the hidden variables based on the current generation of parameters, and obtain a probability distribution of hidden variables over all possible values of these hidden variables. Intuitively, this is to take a good guess of the values of the hidden variables. Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values. This process is repeated until convergence to a local maximum of the likelihood function."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": ["We can compute this maximum estimate by using the EM algorithm. So in the e step (shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-estep}, we now have to introduce more hidden variables because we have more topics, so our hidden variable z now, which is a topic indicator can take more than two values. So specifically will take a k plus one values, with b in the noting the background. And once locate, to denote other k topics, right. So, now the e step, as you can recall is your augmented data, and by predicting the values of the hidden variable. So we're going to predict for a word, whether the word has come from one of these k plus one distributions. This equation allows us to predict the probability that the word w in document d is generated from topic zero sub j. And the bottom one is the predicted probability that this word has been generated from the background. Note that we use document d here to index the word. Why? Because whether a word is from a particular topic actually depends on the document. Can you see why? Well, it's through the pi's. The pi's are tied to each document. Each document can have potentially different pi's, right. The pi's will then affect our prediction. So, the pi's are here. And this depends on the document. And that might give a different guess for a word in different documents, and that's desirable. In both cases we are using the Baye's Rule, as I explained, basically assessing the likelihood of generating word from each of this division and there's normalize. What about the m step? See Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. Well, we may recall the m step is we take advantage of the inferred z values. To split the counts. And then collected the right counts to re-estimate the parameters. So in this case, we can re-estimate our coverage of probability. And this is re-estimated based on collecting all the words in the document. And that's why we have the count of the word in document. And sum over all the words. And then we're going to look at to what extent this word belongs to the topic theta sub j. And this part is our guess from each step. This tells us how likely this word is actually from theta sub j. And when we multiply them together, we get the discounted count that's located for topic theta sub j. And when we normalize this over all the topics, we get the distribution of all the topics to indicate the coverage. And similarly, the bottom one is the estimated probability of word for a topic. And in this case we are using exact the same count, you can see this is the same discounted account, ] it tells us to what extend we should allocate this word [INAUDIBLE] but then normalization is different. Because in this case we are interested in the word distribution, so we simply normalize this over all the words. This is different, in contrast here we normalize the amount all the topics. It would be useful to take a comparison between the two. This give us different distributions. And these tells us how to improve the parameters. And as I just explained, in both the formula is we have a maximum estimate based on allocated word counts [INAUDIBLE]. Now this phenomena is actually general phenomena in all the EM algorithms. In the m-step, you general with the computer expect an account of the event based on the e-step result,", "So, in each step we're going to do e-step and m-step. In the e-step we're going to do augment the data by predicting the hidden variables. In this case, the hidden variable, z sub d, w, indicates whether the word w in d is from a topic or background. And if it's from a topic, which topic. So if you look at the e-step formulas, essentially we're actually normalizing these counts, sorry, these probabilities of observing the word from each distribution. So you can see, basically the prediction of word from topic zero sub j is based on the probability of selecting that theta sub j as a word distribution to generate the word. Multiply by the probability of observing the word from that distribution. And I said it's proportional to this because in the implementation of EM algorithm you can keep counter for this quantity, and in the end it just normalizes it. So the normalization here is over all the topics and then you would get a probability. Now, in the m-step, we do the same, and we are going to collect these. Allocated account for each topic. And we split words among the topics. And then we're going to normalize them in different ways to obtain the real estimate. So for example, we can normalize among all the topics to get the re-estimate of pi, the coverage. Or we can re-normalize based on all the words. And that would give us a word distribution. So it's useful to think algorithm in this way because when implemented, you can just use variables, but keep track of these quantities in each case. And then you just normalize these variables to make them distribution. Now I did not put the constraint for this one. And I intentionally leave this as an exercise for you.

We show the equations in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. We see that a key component in the two equations, for re-estimating $\\pi$ and $p(w|\\theta)$ respectively, is $c(w,d)(1-p(z_{d,w}=B)p(z_{d,w}=j)$, which can be interpreted as the allocated counts of $w$ to topic $\\theta_j$. Intuitively, we use the inferred distribution of $z$ values from the E-step to split the counts of $w$ among all the distributions. The amount of split counts of $w$ that $\\theta_j$ can get is determined based on the inferred likelihood that $w$ is generated by topic $\\theta_j$.\nOnce we have such a split count of each word for each distribution, we can easily pool together these split counts to re-estimate both $\\pi$ and $p(w|\\theta)$ as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. To re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$, the probability that document $d$ covers topic $\\theta_j$, we would simply collect all the split counts of words in document $d$ that belong to each $\\theta_j$, and then normalize these counts among all the $k$ topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, we would collect the split counts of a word toward $\\theta_j$ from all the documents in the collection, and then normalize these counts among all the words.

In the case of re-estimation of $\\pi$, the constraint is that the $\\pi$ values must sum to one for each document, thus our normalizer has been chosen to ensure that the re-estimated values of $\\pi$ indeed sum to one for each document. The same is true for the re-estimation of $p(w|\\theta)$, where our normalizer allows us to obtain a word distribution for each topic.\nWhat we observed here is actually generally true when using the EM algorithm. That is, the distribution of the hidden variables computed in the E-step can be used to compute the expected counts of an event, which can then aggregated and normalized appropriately to obtain a re-estimate of the parameters.

Note that the same word would generally be split in different ways in different documents. Once we split the counts for all the words in this way, we can aggregate the split counts and normalize them. For example, to re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$ (coverage of topic $\\theta_j$ in document $d$), the relevant counts would be the counts of words in $d$ that have been allocated to topic $\\theta_j$, and the normalizer would be the sum of all such counts over all the topics so that after normalization, we would obtain a probability distribution over all the topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, the relevant counts are the sum of all the split counts of word $w$ in all the documents. These aggregated counts would then be normalized by the sum of such aggregated counts over all the words in the vocabulary so that after normalization, we again would obtain a distribution, this time over all the words rather than all the topics."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["First, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values. In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this.

So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm.", "So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point.

In each iteration, it would invoke an E-step followed by an M-step, which will be explained in more detail.", "This step of re-estimating parameters based on the results from the E-step is called the M-step. With the E-step and M-step as the basis, the EM algorithm works as follows. First, we initialize all the (unknown) parameters values randomly. This allows us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which further enables us to use Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. This prediction (\\ie, E-step) essentially helps us (probabilistically) separate words generated by the two distributions. Finally, we will collect all the probabilistically allocated counts of words belonging to our topic word distribution and normalize them into probabilities, which serve as an improved estimate of the parameters. The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values. In the M-step, we adjust the count $c(w,d)$ based on $p(z=0|w)$ (\\ie, probability that the word $w$ is indeed from $\\theta_d$) so as to obtain a discounted count $c(w,d)p(z=0|w)$ which can be interpreted as the expected count of the event that word $w$ is generated from $\\theta_B$. Similarly, $\\theta_B$ has its own share of the count, which is $c(w,d)p(z=1|w) = c(w,d)[1-p(z=0|w)]$, and we have showing that all the counts of word $w$ have been split between the two distributions. Thus, the M-step is simply to normalize these discounted counts for all the words to obtain a probability distribution over all the words, which can then be regarded as our improved estimate of $p(w|\\theta_d)$.", "Once we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words. For example, the count of \\emph{the} is 4, but since $p(z=0|\\text{the})=0.33$, we would obtain a discounted count of \\emph{the}, $4\\cdot 0.33$, when estimating $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ in the M-step. Similarly, the adjusted count for \\emph{text} would be $4\\cdot 0.71$. After the M-step, $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ would be much higher than $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ as shown in the table (shown in the first column under Iteration 2). Those words that are believed to have come from the topic word distribution $\\theta_d$ according to the E-step would have a higher probability. This new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values, leading to a new generation of probabilities for the $z$ values, which can be fed into another M-step to generate yet another generation of potentially improved estimate of $\\theta_d$.", "The EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm. It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. You might wonder why we don't work on finding an improved parameter value directly on the original likelihood function. Indeed, it is possible to do that, but in the EM algorithm, the auxiliary function is usually much easier to optimize than the original likelihood function, so in this sense, it reduces the problem into a somewhat simpler one. Although the auxiliary function is generally easier to optimize, it does not always have an analytical solution, which means that the maximization of the auxiliary function may itself require another iterative process, which would be embedded in the overall iterative process of the EM algorithm. In our case of the simple mixture model, we did not explicitly compute this auxiliary function in the E-step because the auxiliary function is very simple and as a result, our M-step has an analytical solution, thus we were able to bypass the explicit computation of this auxiliary function and go directly to find a re-estimate of the parameters. Thus in the E-step, we only computed a key component in the auxiliary function, which is the probability that a word has been generated from each of the two distributions, and our M-step directly gives us an analytical solution to the problem of optimizing the auxiliary function, and the solution directly uses the values obtained from the E-step.", "Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values.

A large number of pathways and technologies are encompassed by the term. In 2016 the German government funded a \u20ac30million first-phase research project into power-to-X options.\n\nSection::::Electricity storage concepts.\nSurplus electric power can be converted to other forms of energy for storage and reconversion. Direct current electrolysis (efficiency 80\u201385% at best) can be used to produce hydrogen which can, in turn, be converted to methane (CH) via methanation. Another possibility is converting the hydrogen, along with CO to methanol. Both these fuels can be stored and used to produce electricity again, hours to months later. Reconversion technologies include gas turbines, CCGT plant, and fuel cells. Power-to-power refers to the round-trip reconversion efficiency. For hydrogen storage, the round-trip efficiency remains limited at 35\u201350%. Electrolysis is expensive and power-to-gas processes need substantial full-load hours (say 30%) to be economic. \n\nHowever, while round-trip conversion efficiency of power-to-power is lower than with batteries and electrolysis can be expensive, storage of the fuels themselves is quite inexpensive. This means that large amounts of energy can be stored for long periods of time with power-to-power, which is ideal for seasonal storage. This could be particularly useful for systems with high renewable penetration, since many areas have significant seasonal variability of solar, wind, and hydroelectric generation. Grid-dedicated battery storage is not normally considered a power-to-X concept.\n\nSection::::Sector coupling concepts.\nHydrogen and methane can also be used as downstream fuels, feed into the natural gas grid, or used to make or synthetic fuel. Alternatively they can be used as a chemical feedstock, as can ammonia ()."]}, "textbook/textdatabook": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

While Wikipedia may not provide an exhaustive explanation tailored to this query, it can offer a general overview that partially addresses why numerical optimization is considered difficult and the challenges involved.", "wikipedia-52033": ["An optimization algorithm is a procedure which is executed iteratively by comparing various solutions until an optimum or a satisfactory solution is found. Optimization algorithms help us to minimize or maximize an objective function E(x) with respect to the internal parameters of a model mapping a set of predictors (X) to target values(Y). Zero-order (or derivative-free) algorithms use only the criterion value at some positions. It is popular when the gradient and Hessian information are difficult to obtain, e.g., no explicit function forms are given. While evaluating Hessians (H) and gradients (G) improves the rate of convergence, for functions for which these quantities exist and vary sufficiently smoothly, such evaluations increase the computational complexity (or computational cost) of each iteration. In some cases, the computational complexity may be excessively high. One major criterion for optimizers is just the number of required function evaluations as this often is already a large computational effort, usually much more effort than within the optimizer itself, which mainly has to operate over the N variables. The derivatives provide detailed information for such optimizers, but are even harder to calculate, e.g. approximating the gradient takes at least N+1 function evaluations.

This is a parameter that we have. On the y axis we see the likelihood function. So this curve is the original likelihood function, and this is the one that we hope to maximize. And we hope to find a c0 value at this point to maximize this. But in the case of Mitsumoto we can not easily find an analytic solution to the problem. So, we have to resolve the numerical errors, and the EM algorithm is such an algorithm. It's a Hill-Climb algorithm. That would mean you start with some random guess. Let's say you start from here, that's your starting point. And then you try to improve this by moving this to another point where you can have a higher likelihood. So that's the ideal hill climbing. And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point. And that's why EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. Now, as you can imagine, when we have many local maxima, we also have to repeat the EM algorithm multiple times. In order to figure out which one is the actual global maximum. And this actually in general is a difficult problem in numeral optimization. So here for example had we started from here, then we gradually just climb up to this top. So, that's not optimal, and we'd like to climb up all the way to here, so the only way to climb up to this gear is to start from somewhere here or here.

This is a parameter that we have. On the y axis we see the likelihood function. So this curve is the original likelihood function, and this is the one that we hope to maximize. And we hope to find a c0 value at this point to maximize this. But in the case of Mitsumoto we can not easily find an analytic solution to the problem. So, we have to resolve the numerical errors, and the EM algorithm is such an algorithm. It's a Hill-Climb algorithm. That would mean you start with some random guess. Let's say you start from here, that's your starting point. And then you try to improve this by moving this to another point where you can have a higher likelihood. So that's the ideal hill climbing. And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. Now, as you can imagine, when we have many local maxima, we also have to repeat the EM algorithm multiple times. In order to figure out which one is the actual global maximum. So here for example had we started from here, then we gradually just climb up to this top. So, that's not optimal, and we'd like to climb up all the way to here, so the only way to climb up to this gear is to start from somewhere here or here.

Where our perspective just means we want to take a particular angle of looking at the data, so that the model will have the right parameters for discovering the knowledge that we want. And then we'll be thinking about the microfunction or write down the microfunction to capture more formally how likely a data point will be obtained from this model. And the likelihood function will have some parameters in the function. And then we argue our interest in estimating those parameters for example, by maximizing the likelihood which will lead to maximum likelihood estimated. These estimator parameters will then become the output of the mining hours, which means we'll take the estimating parameters as the knowledge that we discover from the text.", "So if you imagine what would we get if we use such a maximum likelihood estimator to estimate one topic for a single document d here?

In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one.

Well first we initialize all the values. So here, this probability that we're interested in is normalized into a uniform distribution of all the words. And then the E-step would give us a guess of the distribution that has been used. That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero.

So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm. As you can see in the last row where we show the log-likelihood, and the likelihood is increasing as we do the iteration.", "It's a Hill-Climb algorithm. That would mean you start with some random guess. Let's say you start from here, that's your starting point. And then you try to improve this by moving this to another point where you can have a higher likelihood. So that's the ideal hill climbing. And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point. And that's why EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. Now, as you can imagine, when we have many local maxima, we also have to repeat the EM algorithm multiple times."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": ["The main idea of the EM algorithm is to guess (infer) which word is from which distribution based on a tentative estimate of parameters, and then use the inferred partitioning of words to improve the estimate of parameters, which, in turn, enables improved inference of the partitioning, leading to an iterative hill-climbing algorithm to improve the estimate of the parameters until hitting a local maximum.", "The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. A main idea of EM is to leverage such hidden variables to simplify the computation of the ML estimate since knowing the values of these hidden variables makes the ML estimate trivial to compute; we can pool together all the words whose $z$ values are 0 and normalize their counts. Knowing $z$ values can potentially help simplify the task of computing the ML estimate, and EM exploits this fact by alternating the E-step and M-step in each iteration so as to improve the parameter estimate in a hill-climbing manner. Specifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.", "We see that after each iteration, the log-likelihood value is increasing, showing that the EM algorithm is iteratively improving the estimated parameter values in a hill-climbing manner.", "The EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm.

At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function.

Since we know all the theta i's must a sum to one we can plug this into this constraint, here. And this will allow us to solve for lambda. And this is just a net sum of all the counts.

In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum.", "First, it would randomly initialize all the parameters to be estimated.

The objective function is the likelihood function and the constraint is that all these probabilities must sum to one. So, one way to solve the problem is to use Lagrange multiplier approace. Now this command is beyond the scope of this course but since Lagrange multiplier is a very useful approach, I also would like to just give a brief introduction to this, for those of you who are interested. So in this approach we will construct a Lagrange function, here. And this function will combine our objective function with another term that encodes our constraint and we introduce Lagrange multiplier here, lambda, so it's an additional parameter. Now, the idea of this approach is just to turn the constraint optimization into, in some sense, an unconstrained optimizing problem. Now we are just interested in optimizing this Lagrange function. As you may recall from calculus, an optimal point would be achieved when the derivative is set to zero. This is a necessary condition. It's not sufficient, though. So if we do that you will see the partial derivative, with respect to theta i here ,is equal to this. And this part comes from the derivative of the logarithm function and this lambda is simply taken from here. And when we set it to zero we can easily see theta sub i is related to lambda in this way. Since we know all the theta i's must a sum to one we can plug this into this constraint, here. And this will allow us to solve for lambda. And this is just a net sum of all the counts.

And we see that in both cases text is possible. Note that even in the background it is still possible, it just has a very small probability. So intuitively what would be your guess seeing this case? Now if you're like many others, you would guess text is probably from c.subd it's more likely from c.subd, why? And you will probably see that it's because text has a much higher probability here by the C now sub D than by the background model which has a very small probability. And by this we're going to say well, text is more likely from theta sub d. So you see our guess of which distributing has been used with the generated text would depend on how high the probability of the data, the text, is in each word distribution. We can do tentative guess that distribution that gives is a word higher probability. And this is likely to maximize the likelihood. All right, so we are going to choose a word that has a higher likelihood. So, in other words we are going to compare these two probabilities of the word given by each of these distributions. But our guess must also be affected by the prior. So we also need to compare these two priors. Why? Because imagine if we adjust these probabilities. We're going to say, the probability of choosing a background model is almost 100 Now if we have that kind of strong prior, then that would affect your gas. You might think, well, wait a moment, maybe texter could have been from the background as well. Although the probability is very small here the prior is very high. So in the end, we have to combine the two. And the base formula provides us a solid and principle way of making this kind of guess to quantify that. So, when we multiply the two together, we get the probability that text has in fact been generated from zero sub d. Similarly, for the background model and the probability of generating text is another product of similar form. Now we also introduced late in the variable z here to denote whether the word is from the background or the topic. When z is 0, it means it's from the topic, theta sub d. When it's 1, it means it's from the background, theta sub B. So now we have the probability that text is generated from each, then we can simply normalize them to have estimate of the probability that the word text is from theta sub d or from theta sub B. And equivalently the probability that Z is equal to zero, given that the observed evidence is text. So this is application of base rule. But this step is very crucial for understanding the EM hours. Because if we can do this, then we would be able to first, initialize the parameter values somewhat randomly. And then, we're going to take a guess of these Z values and all, which distributing has been used to generate which word. And the initialize the parameter values would allow us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which allows us to apply Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. And this prediction essentially helped us to separate words from the two distributions. Although we can't separate them for sure, but we can separate then probabilistically as shown here.", "And here we show some possible values of these variables.

And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right?

In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in. Start with initial values that are often random themself. And then we invoke E-step followed by M-step to get an improved setting of parameters. And then we repeated this, so this a Hill-Climbing algorithm that would gradually improve the estimate of parameters.", "And then the E-step would give us a guess of the distribution that has been used. That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate.", "In the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point. And that's why EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. Now, as you can imagine, when we have many local maxima, we also have to repeat the EM algorithm multiple times.

In each iteration, it would invoke an E-step followed by an M-step, which will be explained in more detail.", "This step of re-estimating parameters based on the results from the E-step is called the M-step.\nWith the E-step and M-step as the basis, the EM algorithm works as follows.\nFirst, we initialize all the (unknown) parameters values randomly. This allows us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which further enables us to use Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. This prediction (\\ie, E-step) essentially helps us (probabilistically) separate words generated by the two distributions. Finally, we will collect all the probabilistically allocated counts of words belonging to our topic word distribution and normalize them into probabilities, which serve as an improved estimate of the parameters. The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum.\nSpecifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.", "Thus the M-step is seen to use the $n$-th generation of parameters together with the newly inferred $z$ values to obtain a new $n+1$-th generation of parameters (\\ie, $p^{n+1}(w|\theta_d)$). In the first iteration of the EM algorithm, we will apply the E-step to infer which of the two distributions has been used to generate each word, \\ie, to compute $p(z=0|w)$ and $p(z=1|w)$. Clearly, $p(z=0|w)$ has different values for different words, and this is because these words have different probabilities in the background model and the initialized $\theta_d$. Once we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words. This new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values, leading to a new generation of probabilities for the $z$ values, which can be fed into another M-step to generate yet another generation of potentially improved estimate of $\theta_d$.", "The EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm.

At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function.", "Second, in the E-step, it would attempt to infer the values of the hidden variables based on the current generation of parameters, and obtain a probability distribution of hidden variables over all possible values of these hidden variables. Intuitively, this is to take a good guess of the values of the hidden variables. Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values. This process is repeated until convergence to a local maximum of the likelihood function."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": ["We can compute this maximum estimate by using the EM algorithm. So in the e step (shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-estep}, we now have to introduce more hidden variables because we have more topics, so our hidden variable z now, which is a topic indicator can take more than two values. So specifically will take a k plus one values, with b in the noting the background. And once locate, to denote other k topics, right. So, now the e step, as you can recall is your augmented data, and by predicting the values of the hidden variable. So we're going to predict for a word, whether the word has come from one of these k plus one distributions. This equation allows us to predict the probability that the word w in document d is generated from topic zero sub j. And the bottom one is the predicted probability that this word has been generated from the background. Note that we use document d here to index the word. Why? Because whether a word is from a particular topic actually depends on the document. Can you see why? Well, it's through the pi's. The pi's are tied to each document. Each document can have potentially different pi's, right. The pi's will then affect our prediction. So, the pi's are here. And this depends on the document. And that might give a different guess for a word in different documents, and that's desirable. In both cases we are using the Baye's Rule, as I explained, basically assessing the likelihood of generating word from each of this division and there's normalize. What about the m step? See Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. Well, we may recall the m step is we take advantage of the inferred z values. To split the counts. And then collected the right counts to re-estimate the parameters. So in this case, we can re-estimate our coverage of probability. And this is re-estimated based on collecting all the words in the document. And that's why we have the count of the word in document. And sum over all the words. And then we're going to look at to what extent this word belongs to the topic theta sub j. And this part is our guess from each step. This tells us how likely this word is actually from theta sub j. And when we multiply them together, we get the discounted count that's located for topic theta sub j. And when we normalize this over all the topics, we get the distribution of all the topics to indicate the coverage. And similarly, the bottom one is the estimated probability of word for a topic. And in this case we are using exact the same count, you can see this is the same discounted account,] it tells us to what extend we should allocate this word [INAUDIBLE] but then normalization is different. Because in this case we are interested in the word distribution, so we simply normalize this over all the words. This is different, in contrast here we normalize the amount all the topics. It would be useful to take a comparison between the two. This give us different distributions. And these tells us how to improve the parameters.", "So, in each step we're going to do e-step and m-step. In the e-step we're going to do augment the data by predicting the hidden variables. In this case, the hidden variable, z sub d, w, indicates whether the word w in d is from a topic or background. And if it's from a topic, which topic. So if you look at the e-step formulas, essentially we're actually normalizing these counts, sorry, these probabilities of observing the word from each distribution. So you can see, basically the prediction of word from topic zero sub j is based on the probability of selecting that theta sub j as a word distribution to generate the word. Multiply by the probability of observing the word from that distribution. And I said it's proportional to this because in the implementation of EM algorithm you can keep counter for this quantity, and in the end it just normalizes it. So the normalization here is over all the topics and then you would get a probability. Now, in the m-step, we do the same, and we are going to collect these. Allocated account for each topic. And we split words among the topics. And then we're going to normalize them in different ways to obtain the real estimate. So for example, we can normalize among all the topics to get the re-estimate of pi, the coverage. Or we can re-normalize based on all the words.

If it's from a real topic, it determines which of the $k$ topics it is from. From Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-em-comp}, we see that in the E-step we need to compute the probability of $z$ values for every unique word in each document. Thus we can iterate over all the documents, and for each document, iterate over all the unique words in the document to compute the corresponding $p(z_{d,w})$.

If you can see the color, that these are showing blue. These blue words are, they are assumed to be from the topic word, distribution. If we already know how to separate these words. Then the problem of estimating the word distribution would be extremely simple, right? If you think about this for a moment, you'll realize that, well, we can simply take all these words that are known to be from this word distribution, see that's a d and normalize them. So indeed this problem would be very easy to solve if we had known which words are from which it is written precisely. And this is in fact, making this model no longer a mystery model because we can already observe which of these distribution has been used to generate which part of the data.", "Now we also introduced late in the variable z here to denote whether the word is from the background or the topic. When z is 0, it means it's from the topic, theta sub d. When it's 1, it means it's from the background, theta sub B. So now we have the probability that text is generated from each, then we can simply normalize them to have estimate of the probability that the word text is from theta sub d or from theta sub B. And equivalently the probability that Z is equal to zero, given that the observed evidence is text. So this is application of base rule. But this step is very crucial for understanding the EM hours. Because if we can do this, then we would be able to first, initialize the parameter values somewhat randomly. And then, we're going to take a guess of these Z values and all, which distributing has been used to generate which word. And the initialize the parameter values would allow us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which allows us to apply Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. And this prediction essentially helped us to separate words from the two distributions.", "So in all the EM algorithms we introduce a hidden variable to help us solve the problem more easily. In our case the hidden variable is a binary variable for each occurrence of a word as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em} And this binary variable would indicate whether the word has been generated from 0 sub d or 0 sub p. And here we show some possible values of these variables. For example, for the it's from background, the z value is one. And text on the other hand. Is from the topic then it's zero for z, etc. Now, of course, we don't observe these z values, we just imagine they're all such. Values of z attaching to other words. And that's why we call these hidden variables. Now, the idea that we talked about before for predicting the word distribution that has been used when we generate the word is it a predictor, the value of this hidden variable? And, so, the EM algorithm then, would work as follows. First, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values. In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter.", "In the E-step we roughly [INAUDIBLE] how many there are by predicting values of useful hidden variables that we would use to simplify the estimation. In our case, this is the distribution that has been used to generate the word. In the M-step then we would exploit such augmented data which would make it easier to estimate the distribution, to improve the estimate of parameters.", "That means, we're not going to just say exactly what's the value of a hidden variable. But we're going to have a probability distribution over the possible values of these hidden variables. So this causes a split of counts of events probabilistically."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": ["According to our mixture model, we can imagine that the words in the text data can be partitioned into two groups. One group will be explained (generated) by the background model. The other group will be explained by the unknown topical model (the topic word distribution). The challenge in computing the ML estimate is that we do not know this partition due to the possibility of generating a word using either of the two distributions in the mixture model. If we actually know which word is from which distribution, computation of the ML estimate would be trivial as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-known-dist}, where $d'$ is used to denote the pseudo document that is composed of all the words in document $d$ that are known to be generated by $\\theta_d$, and the ML estimate of $\\theta_d$ is seen to be simply the normalized word frequency in this pseudo document $d'$. That is, we can simply pool together all the words generated from $\\theta_d$, compute the count of each word, and then normalize the count by the total counts of all the words in such a pseudo document. In such a case, our mixture model is really just two independent unigram language models, which can thus be estimated separately based on the data points generated by each of them. Unfortunately, the real situation is such that we don't really know which word is from which distribution. The main idea of the EM algorithm is to guess (infer) which word is from which distribution based on a tentative estimate of parameters, and then use the inferred partitioning of words to improve the estimate of parameters, which, in turn, enables improved inference of the partitioning, leading to an iterative hill-climbing algorithm to improve the estimate of the parameters until hitting a local maximum.", "In Figure~\\ref{fig:em-infer}, we introduced a binary latent variable $z$ here to denote whether the word is from the background or the topic. When $z$ is 0, it means it's from the topic, $\\theta_d$; when it's 1, it means it's from the background, $\\theta_B$. The posterior probability $p(z=0|w=\\text{text}) $ formally captures our guess about which distribution has been used to generate the word \\emph{text}, and it is seen to be proportional to the product of the prior $p(\\theta_d)$ and the likelihood $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$, which is intuitively very meaningful since in order to generate \\emph{text} from $\\theta_d$, we must first choose $\\theta_d$ (as opposed to $\\theta_B$), which is captured by $p(\\theta_d)$, and then obtain word \\emph{text} from the selected $\\theta_d$, which is captured by $p(w|\\theta_d)$. Understanding how to make such a Bayesian inference of which distribution has been used to generate a word based on a set of tentative parameter values is very crucial for understanding the EM algorithm. This is essentially the E-step of the EM algorithm where we use Bayes' rule to partition data and allocate all the data points among all the component models in the mixture model. Note that the E-step essentially helped us figure out which words have been generated from $\\theta_d$ (and equivalently, which words have been generated from $\\theta_B$) except that it does not completely allocate a word to $\\theta_d$ (or $\\theta_B$), but splits a word in between the two distributions.

In another version, the hidden-variables are inaccessible to us and thus in principle not detectable. The existence of indeterminacy for some measurements is a characteristic of prevalent interpretations of quantum mechanics; moreover, bounds for indeterminacy can be expressed in a quantitative form by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\nUnder the Copenhagen interpretation, quantum mechanics is non-deterministic, meaning that it generally does not predict the outcome of any measurement with certainty. Instead, it indicates what the probabilities of the outcomes are, with the indeterminism of observable quantities constrained by the uncertainty principle. The question arises whether there might be some deeper reality hidden beneath quantum mechanics, to be described by a more fundamental theory that can always predict the outcome of each measurement with certainty: if the exact properties of every subatomic particle were known the entire system could be modeled exactly using deterministic physics similar to classical physics.\n\nIn other words, it is conceivable that the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics is an incomplete description of nature.

Then the problem of estimating the word distribution would be extremely simple, right? If you think about this for a moment, you'll realize that, well, we can simply take all these words that are known to be from this word distribution, see that's a d and normalize them. So indeed this problem would be very easy to solve if we had known which words are from which it is written precisely. And this is in fact, making this model no longer a mystery model because we can already observe which of these distribution has been used to generate which part of the data.\n\nNow, this idea, however, doesn't work because we in practice, don't really know which word is from which distribution. But this gives us an idea of perhaps we can guess which word is from which distribution.", "So in all the EM algorithms we introduce a hidden variable to help us solve the problem more easily. In our case the hidden variable is a binary variable for each occurrence of a word as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em} And this binary variable would indicate whether the word has been generated from 0 sub d or 0 sub p. And here we show some possible values of these variables. For example, for the it's from background, the z value is one. And text on the other hand. Is from the topic then it's zero for z, etc. Now, of course, we don't observe these z values, we just imagine they're all such. Values of z attaching to other words. And that's why we call these hidden variables. Now, the idea that we talked about before for predicting the word distribution that has been used when we generate the word is it a predictor, the value of this hidden variable? And, so, the EM algorithm then, would work as follows. First, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values. In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters.

These parameter-estimates are then used to determine the distribution of the latent variables in the next E step.\n\nThe EM algorithm proceeds from the observation that there is a way to solve these two sets of equations numerically. One can simply pick arbitrary values for one of the two sets of unknowns, use them to estimate the second set, then use these new values to find a better estimate of the first set, and then keep alternating between the two until the resulting values both converge to fixed points.\n\nThe motive is as follows. If the value of the parameters formula_3 is known, usually the value of the latent variables formula_2 can be found by maximizing the log-likelihood over all possible values of formula_2, either simply by iterating over formula_2 or through an algorithm such as the Baum\u2013Welch algorithm for hidden Markov models. Conversely, if we know the value of the latent variables formula_2, we can find an estimate of the parameters formula_3 fairly easily, typically by simply grouping the observed data points according to the value of the associated latent variable and averaging the values, or some function of the values, of the points in each group."]}, "textbook/textdatabook": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

So that would mean, for example, these words, the, is, and we, are known to be from this background origin, distribution. On the other hand, the other words, text mining, clustering, etcetera are known to be from the topic word, distribution as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-known-dist}. If you can see the color, that these are showing blue. These blue words are, they are assumed to be from the topic word, distribution. If we already know how to separate these words. Then the problem of estimating the word distribution would be extremely simple, right? If you think about this for a moment, you'll realize that, well, we can simply take all these words that are known to be from this word distribution, see that's a d and normalize them. So indeed this problem would be very easy to solve if we had known which words are from which it is written precisely. And this is in fact, making this model no longer a mystery model because we can already observe which of these distribution has been used to generate which part of the data. So we, actually go back to the single order distribution problem. And in this case, let's call these words that are known to be from theta d, a pseudo document of d prime. And now all we have to do is just normalize these word accounts for each word, w sub i. And that's fairly straightforward, and it's just dictated by the maximum estimator. Now, this idea, however, doesn't work because we in practice, don't really know which word is from which distribution. But this gives us an idea of perhaps we can guess which word is from which distribution. Specifically, given all the parameters, can we infer the distribution a word is from?", "So in all the EM algorithms we introduce a hidden variable to help us solve the problem more easily. In our case the hidden variable is a binary variable for each occurrence of a word as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em}. And this binary variable would indicate whether the word has been generated from 0 sub d or 0 sub p. And here we show some possible values of these variables. For example, for the it's from background, the z value is one. And text on the other hand. Is from the topic then it's zero for z, etc. Now, of course, we don't observe these z values, we just imagine they're all such. Values of z attaching to other words. And that's why we call these hidden variables. Now, the idea that we talked about before for predicting the word distribution that has been used when we generate the word is it a predictor, the value of this hidden variable? And, so, the EM algorithm then, would work as follows. First, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values. In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in.", "So here, this probability that we're interested in is normalized into a uniform distribution of all the words. And then the E-step would give us a guess of the distribution that has been used. That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm.", "The E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point. ... In the E-step we roughly [INAUDIBLE] how many there are by predicting values of useful hidden variables that we would use to simplify the estimation. In our case, this is the distribution that has been used to generate the word.

That means, we're not going to just say exactly what's the value of a hidden variable. But we're going to have a probability distribution over the possible values of these hidden variables.

And in our case we'll split the word counts between the two distributions."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": ["The main idea of the EM algorithm is to guess (infer) which word is from which distribution based on a tentative estimate of parameters, and then use the inferred partitioning of words to improve the estimate of parameters, which, in turn, enables improved inference of the partitioning, leading to an iterative hill-climbing algorithm to improve the estimate of the parameters until hitting a local maximum. In each iteration, it would invoke an E-step followed by an M-step, which will be explained in more detail.", "Understanding how to make such a Bayesian inference of which distribution has been used to generate a word based on a set of tentative parameter values is very crucial for understanding the EM algorithm. This is essentially the E-step of the EM algorithm where we use Bayes' rule to partition data and allocate all the data points among all the component models in the mixture model. Note that the E-step essentially helped us figure out which words have been generated from \u03b8_d (and equivalently, which words have been generated from \u03b8_B) except that it does not completely allocate a word to \u03b8_d (or \u03b8_B), but splits a word in between the two distributions. That is, p(z=0|text) tells us what percent of the count of text should be allocated to \u03b8_d, and thus contribute to the estimate of \u03b8_d.", "A main idea of EM is to leverage such hidden variables to simplify the computation of the ML estimate since knowing the values of these hidden variables makes the ML estimate trivial to compute; we can pool together all the words whose $z$ values are 0 and normalize their counts. Knowing $z$ values can potentially help simplify the task of computing the ML estimate, and EM exploits this fact by alternating the E-step and M-step in each iteration so as to improve the parameter estimate in a hill-climbing manner. Specifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.", "In the first iteration of the EM algorithm, we will apply the E-step to infer which of the two distributions has been used to generate each word, \\ie, to compute $p(z=0|w)$ and $p(z=1|w)$. We only showed $p(z=0|w)$, which is needed in our M-step ($p(z=1|w)=1-p(z=0|w)$). Clearly, $p(z=0|w)$ has different values for different words, and this is because these words have different probabilities in the background model and the initialized $\theta_d$. Thus, even though the two distributions are equally likely (by our prior) and our initial values for $p(w|\theta_d)$ form a uniform distribution, the inferred $p(z=0|w)$ would tend to give words with smaller probabilities according to $p(w|\theta_B)$ a higher probability. For example, $p(z=0|\\text{text}) > p(z=0|\\text{the})$. Once we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words. For example, the count of \\emph{the} is 4, but since $p(z=0|\\text{the})=0.33$, we would obtain a discounted count of \\emph{the}, $4\\cdot 0.33$, when estimating $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ in the M-step. Similarly, the adjusted count for \\emph{text} would be $4\\cdot 0.71$. After the M-step, $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ would be much higher than $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ as shown in the table (shown in the first column under Iteration 2). Those words that are believed to have come from the topic word distribution $\\theta_d$ according to the E-step would have a higher probability. This new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values, leading to a new generation of probabilities for the $z$ values, which can be fed into another M-step to generate yet another generation of potentially improved estimate of $\\theta_d$.", "The EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm. It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. You might wonder why we don't work on finding an improved parameter value directly on the original likelihood function. Indeed, it is possible to do that, but in the EM algorithm, the auxiliary function is usually much easier to optimize than the original likelihood function, so in this sense, it reduces the problem into a somewhat simpler one. Although the auxiliary function is generally easier to optimize, it does not always have an analytical solution, which means that the maximization of the auxiliary function may itself require another iterative process, which would be embedded in the overall iterative process of the EM algorithm.\nThe hidden variables introduced in a mixture model often indicate which component model has been used to generate a data point. Thus once we know the values of these hidden variables, we would be able to partition data and identify the data points that are likely generated from any particular distribution, thus facilitating estimation.", "In general, when we apply the EM algorithm, we would augment our data with supplementary unobserved hidden variables to simplify the estimation problem. The EM algorithm would then work as follows. First, it would randomly initialize all the parameters to be estimated. Second, in the E-step, it would attempt to infer the values of the hidden variables based on the current generation of parameters, and obtain a probability distribution of hidden variables over all possible values of these hidden variables. Intuitively, this is to take a good guess of the values of the hidden variables. Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values. This process is repeated until convergence to a local maximum of the likelihood function."], "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/12": ["The main idea of the EM algorithm is to ``augment'' our data with some latent variables so that the ``complete'' data has a much simpler likelihood function---simpler for the purpose of finding a maxima.

This computation involves computing the product of the probability of selecting a topic and the probability of word $w$ given by the selected distribution. We can then normalize these products based on the constraints we have, to ensure $\\sum_{j=1}^k p(z_{d,w}=j)=1$. In this case, the normalization is among all the topics.

Once we split the counts for all the words in this way, we can aggregate the split counts and normalize them. For example, to re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$ (coverage of topic $\\theta_j$ in document $d$), the relevant counts would be the counts of words in $d$ that have been allocated to topic $\\theta_j$, and the normalizer would be the sum of all such counts over all the topics so that after normalization, we would obtain a probability distribution over all the topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, the relevant counts are the sum of all the split counts of word $w$ in all the documents. These aggregated counts would then be normalized by the sum of such aggregated counts over all the words in the vocabulary so that after normalization, we again would obtain a distribution, this time over all the words rather than all the topics."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": ["So in the e step (shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-estep}, we now have to introduce more hidden variables because we have more topics, so our hidden variable z now, which is a topic indicator can take more than two values. So specifically will take a k plus one values, with b in the noting the background. And once locate, to denote other k topics, right. So, now the e step, as you can recall is your augmented data, and by predicting the values of the hidden variable. So we're going to predict for a word, whether the word has come from one of these k plus one distributions. This equation allows us to predict the probability that the word w in document d is generated from topic zero sub j. And the bottom one is the predicted probability that this word has been generated from the background. Note that we use document d here to index the word. Why? Because whether a word is from a particular topic actually depends on the document. Can you see why? Well, it's through the pi's. The pi's are tied to each document. Each document can have potentially different pi's, right. The pi's will then affect our prediction. So, the pi's are here. And this depends on the document. And that might give a different guess for a word in different documents, and that's desirable. In both cases we are using the Baye's Rule, as I explained, basically assessing the likelihood of generating word from each of this division and there's normalize. What about the m step? See Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. Well, we may recall the m step is we take advantage of the inferred z values. To split the counts. And then collected the right counts to re-estimate the parameters. So in this case, we can re-estimate our coverage of probability. And this is re-estimated based on collecting all the words in the document. And that's why we have the count of the word in document. And sum over all the words. And then we're going to look at to what extent this word belongs to the topic theta sub j. And this part is our guess from each step. This tells us how likely this word is actually from theta sub j. And when we multiply them together, we get the discounted count that's located for topic theta sub j. And when we normalize this over all the topics, we get the distribution of all the topics to indicate the coverage. And similarly, the bottom one is the estimated probability of word for a topic. And in this case we are using exact the same count, you can see this is the same discounted account,] it tells us to what extend we should allocate this word [INAUDIBLE] but then normalization is different. Because in this case we are interested in the word distribution, so we simply normalize this over all the words. This is different, in contrast here we normalize the amount all the topics. It would be useful to take a comparison between the two. This give us different distributions. And these tells us how to improve the parameters.", "In the e-step we're going to do augment the data by predicting the hidden variables. In this case, the hidden variable, z sub d, w, indicates whether the word w in d is from a topic or background. And if it's from a topic, which topic. So if you look at the e-step formulas, essentially we're actually normalizing these counts, sorry, these probabilities of observing the word from each distribution. So you can see, basically the prediction of word from topic zero sub j is based on the probability of selecting that theta sub j as a word distribution to generate the word. Multiply by the probability of observing the word from that distribution. And I said it's proportional to this because in the implementation of EM algorithm you can keep counter for this quantity, and in the end it just normalizes it. So the normalization here is over all the topics and then you would get a probability. Now, in the m-step, we do the same, and we are going to collect these. Allocated account for each topic. And we split words among the topics. And then we're going to normalize them in different ways to obtain the real estimate. So for example, we can normalize among all the topics to get the re-estimate of pi, the coverage. Or we can re-normalize based on all the words. And that would give us a word distribution. So it's useful to think algorithm in this way because when implemented, you can just use variables, but keep track of these quantities in each case.

Understanding how to make such a Bayesian inference of which distribution has been used to generate a word based on a set of tentative parameter values is very crucial for understanding the EM algorithm.

Specifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.", "Once we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the\nM-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the\ncorresponding words.

It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. You might wonder why we don't work on finding an improved parameter value directly on the original likelihood function. Indeed, it is possible to do that, but in the EM algorithm, the auxiliary function is usually much easier to optimize than the original likelihood function, so in this sense, it reduces the problem into a somewhat simpler one. Although the auxiliary function is generally easier to optimize, it does not always have an analytical solution, which means that the maximization of the auxiliary function may itself require another iterative process, which would be embedded in the overall iterative process of the EM algorithm. In our case of the simple mixture model, we did not explicitly compute this auxiliary function in the E-step because the auxiliary function is very simple and as a result, our M-step has an analytical solution, thus we were able to bypass the explicit computation of this auxiliary function and go directly to find a re-estimate of the parameters. Thus in the E-step, we only computed a key component in the auxiliary function, which is the probability that a word has been generated from each of the two distributions, and our M-step directly gives us an analytical solution to the problem of optimizing the auxiliary function, and the solution directly uses the values obtained from the E-step. The EM algorithm has many applications. For example, in general, parameter estimation of all mixture models can be done by using the EM algorithm. The hidden variables introduced in a mixture model often indicate which component model has been used to generate a data point. Thus once we know the values of these hidden variables, we would be able to partition data and identify the data points that are likely generated from any particular distribution, thus facilitating estimation", "In general, when we apply\nthe EM algorithm, we would augment our data with supplementary unobserved hidden\nvariables to simplify the estimation problem.

Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, the relevant counts are the sum of all the split counts of word $w$ in all the documents. These aggregated counts would then be normalized by the sum of such aggregated counts over all the words in the vocabulary so that after normalization, we again would obtain a distribution, this time over all the words rather than all the topics."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": ["We can compute this maximum estimate by using the EM algorithm.\nSo in the e step (shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-estep},\nwe now have to introduce more hidden\nvariables because we have more topics,\nso our hidden variable z now,\nwhich is a topic indicator can\ntake more than two values.\nSo specifically will\ntake a k plus one values,\nwith b in the noting the background.\nAnd once locate,\nto denote other k topics, right.\nSo, now the e step, as you can\nrecall is your augmented data, and\nby predicting the values\nof the hidden variable.\nSo we're going to predict for\na word, whether the word has come from\none of these k plus one distributions.\nThis equation allows us to\npredict the probability\nthat the word w in document d is\ngenerated from topic zero sub j.\nAnd the bottom one is\nthe predicted probability that this\nword has been generated\nfrom the background.\nNote that we use document\nd here to index the word.\nWhy?\nBecause whether a word is\nfrom a particular topic\nactually depends on the document.\nCan you see why?\nWell, it's through the pi's.\nThe pi's are tied to each document.\nEach document can have potentially\ndifferent pi's, right.\nThe pi's will then affect our prediction.\nSo, the pi's are here.\nAnd this depends on the document.\nAnd that might give a different guess for\na word in different documents,\nand that's desirable.\nIn both cases we are using\nthe Baye's Rule, as I explained, basically\nassessing the likelihood of generating\nword from each of this division and\nthere's normalize.\nWhat about the m step?

So you can see, basically the prediction of word from topic zero sub j is based on the probability of selecting that theta sub j as a word distribution to generate the word. Multiply by the probability of observing the word from that distribution. And I said it's proportional to this because in the implementation of EM algorithm you can keep counter for this quantity, and in the end it just normalizes it. So the normalization here is over all the topics and then you would get a probability. Now, in the m-step, we do the same, and we are going to collect these. Allocated account for each topic.

A main assumption is that those common words are generated using the background model, while the more discriminative content-bearing words are generated using the (unknown) topic word distribution as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:mixlm-background}. This is also the scenario that we used to motivate the use of the mixture model. Figure~\\ref{fig:1-topic-est} illustrates such a scenario. In this scenario, the only parameters unknown would be the topic word distribution $p(w|\\theta_d)$. Thus we have exactly the same number of parameters to estimate as in the case of a single unigram language model. Note that this is an example of customizing a general probabilistic model so that we can embed an unknown variable that we are interested in computing, while simplifying other parts of the model based on certain assumptions that we can make about them. That is, we assume that we have knowledge about other variables. Setting the background model to a fixed word distribution based on the maximum likelihood estimate of a unigram language model of a large sample of English text is not only feasible, but also desirable since our goal of designing such a generative model is to factor out the common words from the topic word distribution to be estimated. Feeding the model with a known background word distribution is a powerful technique to inject our knowledge about what words are counted as noise (stop words in this case). Similarly, the parameter $p(\\theta_B)$ can also be set based on our desired percentage of common words to factor out; the larger $p(\\theta_B)$ is set, the more common words would be removed from the topic word distribution. It's easy to see that if $p(\\theta_B)=0$, then we would not be able to remove any common words as the model degenerates to the simple case of using just one distribution (to explain all the words)."], "textbook/textdatabook/joint-analysis/social-network.jsonl/4": ["Following this thinking, the main idea of performing joint analysis of text and associated network context is to use the network to impose some constraints on the model parameters. For example, the text at adjacent nodes of the network can be assumed to cover similar topics. Indeed, in many cases, they do tend to cover similar topics; two authors collaborating with each other tend to publish papers on similar topics. Such a constraint or preference would essentially attempt to smooth the topic distributions on the graph or network so that adjacent nodes will have very similar topic distributions. This means we expect them to share a common distribution on the topics, or have just slight variations of the topic coverage distribution.", "Below we introduce a specific instantiation called NetPLSA (shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:netplsa-equation}), which is an extension of PLSA to incorporate network context by implementing the heuristic that the neighbors on the network must have similar topic distributions.\nAs shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:netplsa-equation}, the new modified objective function is a weighted sum of the standard PLSA likelihood function and a regularizer where the parameter $\\lambda \\in [0,1] $ controls the weight on the regularizer. Clearly, if $\\lambda=0$, the model reduces to the standard PLSA@. In the regularizer, we see that the main constraint is the square loss defined on the difference of the topic selection probabilities of the two neighboring nodes $u$ and $v$: $\\sum_{j=1}^k (p(\\theta_j|u)-p(\\theta_j|v))^2$, which strongly prefers to give $p(\\theta_j|u)$ and $p(\\theta_j|v)$ similar values. In front of this regularization term, we see a weight $w(u,v)$, which is based on our network context where the edges may be weighted. This weight states that the more connected the two nodes are, the more important it is to ensure the two nodes have similar topics. In the case when the edges are not weighted, we may set $w(u,v)=1$ if there exists an edge between $u$ and $v$, and $w(u,v)=0$ otherwise, essentially to keep only the regularizer for edges that exist on the graph.\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-topics}, we show the four major topics discovered using the standard PLSA from a bibliographic database data set DBLP which consists of titles of papers from four research communities, including information retrieval (IR), data mining (DM), machine learning (ML), and World Wide Web (Web). The data set has been constructed by pooling together papers from these research communities, and our goal is to see if NetPLSA can more successfully learn topics well aligned to the communities than the standard PLSA. The results in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-topics} show that PLSA is unable to generate the four communities that correspond to our intuition. The reason was because they are all mixed together and there are many words that are shared by these communities, and the co-occurrence statistics in the data are insufficient for separating them.\nIn contrast, the results of NetPLSA, shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:netplsa-topics}, are much more meaningful, and the four topics correspond well to the four communities that we intend to discover from the data set. Indeed, it is very easy to label them with the four communities as shown in the table. The reason why NetPLSA can separate these communities well and discover more meaningful topics is because of the influence of the network context. Since our network is the collaboration network of authors, when we impose the preference for two nodes connected in the network to have similar topics, the model would further tune the discovered topics to better reflect the topics worked on by authors involved in the same collaboration network. As a result, the topics would be more coherent and also better correspond to the communities (represented by subnetworks of collaboration)."], "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/bayesian-stats.jsonl/21": ["We know that the Beta and binomial distributions are similar. In fact, their relationship can be stated as \\emph{the Beta distribution is the conjugate prior of the binomial distribution}. All distributions in the exponential family have conjugate priors. The relationship is such: given a likelihood from an $X$ distribution, picking the conjugate prior distribution of $X$ (say it's $Y$) will ensure that the posterior distribution is also a $Y$ distribution. For our coin flipping case, the likelihood was a binomial distribution. We picked our prior to be the Beta distribution, and our posterior distribution ended up also being a Beta distribution---this is because we picked the conjugate prior!"], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/26": ["Specifically our target topic unigram language model should not have to generate the common words. This further suggests that we must introduce another distribution to generate these common words so that we can have a complete generative model for all the words in the document. Since we intend for this second distribution to explain the common words, a natural choice for this distribution is the background unigram language model. We thus have a mixture model with two component unigram language models, one being the unknown topic that we would like to discover, and one being a background language model that is fixed to assign high probabilities to common words.", "The sum is over the two different ways to generate the word, corresponding to using each of the two distributions. Each term in the sum captures the probability of observing the word from one of the two distributions. For example, $p(\\theta_B)p(w|\\theta_B)$ gives the probability of observing word $w$ from the background language model. The product is due to the fact that in order to observe word $w$, we must have 1) decided to use the background distribution (which has the probability of $p(\\theta_B)$), and 2) obtained word $w$ from the distribution $\\theta_B$ (which has the probability of $p(w|\\theta_B)$). Both events must happen in order to observe word $w$ from the background distribution, thus we multiply their probabilities to obtain the probability of observing $w$ from the background distribution. Similarly, $p(\\theta_d)p(w|\\theta_d)$ gives the probability of observing word $w$ from the topic word distribution. Adding them together gives us the total probability of observing $w$ regardless which distribution has actually been used to generate the word.\nSuch a form of likelihood actually reflects some general characteristics of the likelihood function of any mixture model. First, the probability of observing a data point from a mixture model is a sum over different ways of generating the word, each corresponding to using a different component model in the mixture model. Second, each term in the sum is a product of two probabilities: one is the probability of selecting the component model corresponding to the term, while the other is the probability of actually observing the data point from that selected component model. Their product gives the probability of observing the data point when it is generated using the corresponding component model, which is why the sum would give the total probability of observing the data point regardless which component model has been used to generate the data point.", "In this case, we can examine what would happen if we set the probability of choosing the background component model to zero. It is easy to see that in such a case, the term corresponding to the background model would disappear from the sum, and the mixture model would degenerate to the special case of just one distribution characterizing the topic to be discovered. In this sense, the mixture model is more general than the previous model where we have just one distribution, which can be covered as a special case. Naturally, our reason for using a mixture model is to enforce a non-zero probability of choosing the background language model so that it can help explain the common words in the data and allow our topic word distribution to be more concentrated on content words."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": ["Here I show a sample article in Figure~\\ref{fig:mixed-topics}, which is a blog article about Hurricane Katrina. And I show some simple topics. For example government response, flood of the city of New Orleans. Donation and the background. You can see in the article we use words from all these distributions. So we first for example see there's a criticism of government response and this is followed by discussion of flooding of the city and donation et cetera. We also see background words mixed with them. So the overall of topic analysis here is to try to decode these topics behind the text, to segment the topics, to figure out which words are from which distribution and to figure out first, what are these topics? How do we know there's a topic about government response. There's a topic about a flood in the city.", "So what's the probability of observing a word from such a distribution? What do you think? Now we've seen this problem many times now and if you can recall, it's generally a sum. Of all the different possibilities of generating a word. So let's first look at how the word can be generated from the background mode. Well, the probability that the word is generated from the background model is lambda multiplied by the probability of the word from the background mode. Model, right. Two things must happen. First, we have to have chosen the background model, and that's the probability of lambda, of sub b. Then second, we must have actually obtained the word w from the background, and that's probability of w given theta sub b. Okay, so similarly, we can figure out the probability of observing the word from another topic. Like the topic theta sub k. Now notice that here's the product of three terms. And that's because of the choice of topic theta sub k, only happens if two things happen. One is we decide not to talk about background. So, that's a probability of 1 minus lambda sub B. Second, we also have to actually choose theta sub K among these K topics. So that's probability of theta sub K, or pi. And similarly, the probability of generating a word from the second. The topic and the first topic are like what you are seeing here. And so in the end the probability of observing the word is just a sum of all these cases. And I have to stress again this is a very important formula to know because this is really key to understanding all the topic models and indeed a lot of mixture models. So make sure that you really understand the probability of w is indeed the sum of these terms. So, next, once we have the likelihood function, we would be interested in knowing the parameters. All right, so to estimate the parameters. But firstly, let's put all these together to have the complete likelihood of function for PLSA. The first line shows the probability of a word as illustrated on the previous slide. And this is an important formula as I said. So let's take a closer look at this. This actually commands all the important parameters. So first of all we see lambda sub b here. This represents a percentage of background words that we believe exist in the text data. And this can be a known value that we set empirically. Second, we see the background language model, and typically we also assume this is known. We can use a large collection of text, or use all the text that we have available to estimate the world of distribution. Now next in the next stop this formula."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/27": ["So we're going to look at a very very simple case. In order to understand some interesting behaviors of a mixture model. The observed pattern here actually are generalizable to mixture model in general. But it's much easier to understand this behavior when we use A very simple case like what we are seeing here in Figure~\\ref{fig:mix-mod-behavior}. So specifically in this case, let's assume that the probability choosing each of the two models is exactly the same. So we're going to flip a fair coin to decide which model to use. Furthermore, we're going to assume there are. Precisely two words, the and text. Obviously this is a very naive oversimplification of the actual text, but again, it's useful to examine the behavior in such a special case.", "And this is clearly because of the use of the background model, which assigned the very high probability to the and low probability to text. And if you look at the equation you will see obviously some interaction of the two distributions here. In particular, you will see in order to make them equal. And then the probability assigned by theta sub d must be higher for a word that has a smaller probability given by the background. This is obvious from examining this equation. Because the background part is weak for text. It's small. So in order to compensate for that, we must make the probability for text given by theta sub D somewhat larger, so that the two sides can be balanced. So this is in fact a very general behavior of this model. And that is, if one distribution assigns a high probability to one word than another, then the other distribution would tend to do the opposite. Basically it would discourage other distributions to do the same And this is to balance them out so we can account for all kinds of words. And this also means that by using a background model that is fixed into assigned high probabilities through background words. We can indeed encourages the unknown topical one of this to assign smaller probabilities for such common words. Instead put more probability than this on the content words, that cannot be explained well by the background model. Meaning that they have a very small probability from the background motor like text here.", "So to summarize, we have just discussed the mixture model. And we discussed that the estimation problem of the mixture model and particular with this discussed some general behavior of the estimator and that means we can expect our estimator to capture these infusions. First every component model attempts to assign high probabilities to high frequent their words in the data. And this is to collaboratively maximize likelihood. Second, different component models tend to bet high probabilities on different words. And this is to avoid a competition or waste of probability. And this would allow them to collaborate more efficiently to maximize the likelihood. So, the probability of choosing each component regulates the collaboration and the competition between component models. It would allow some component models to respond more to the change, for example, of frequency of the theta point in the data. We also talked about the special case of fixing one component to a background word distribution, right? And this distribution can be estimated by using a collection of documents, a large collection of English documents, by using just one distribution and then we'll just have normalized frequencies of terms to give us the probabilities of all these words."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["So, this is now a familiar scenario of using two components, the mixture model to try to fact out the background words from one topic or word distribution.\nNow this started with the idea of separating the words in the text data into two groups. One group will be explained by the background model. The other group will be explained by the unknown topical order. After all this is the basic idea of the mixture model.\nBut, suppose we actually know which word is from which distribution. So that would mean, for example, these words, the, is, and we, are known to be from this background origin, distribution. On the other hand, the other words, text mining, clustering, etcetera are known to be from the topic word, distribution as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-known-dist}.\nNow, this inference process is a typical of basing an inference situation, where we have some prior about these two distributions. So can you see what is our prior here? Well, the prior here is the probability of each distribution, right. So the prior is given by these two probabilities. In this case, the prior is saying that each model is equally likely.", "Now in basic inference, we typical them with our belief after we have observed the evidence. So what is the evidence here? Well, the evidence here is the word text. Now that we know we're interested in the word text. So text can be regarded as evidence. And if we use base rule to combine the prior and the theta likelihood, what we will end up with is to combine the prior with the likelihood that you see here. Which is basically the probability of the word text from each distribution. And we see that in both cases text is possible. Note that even in the background it is still possible, it just has a very small probability. So intuitively what would be your guess seeing this case? Now if you're like many others, you would guess text is probably from c.subd it's more likely from c.subd, why? And you will probably see that it's because text has a much higher probability here by the C now sub D than by the background model which has a very small probability. And by this we're going to say well, text is more likely from theta sub d. So you see our guess of which distributing has been used with the generated text would depend on how high the probability of the data, the text, is in each word distribution. We can do tentative guess that distribution that gives is a word higher probability. And this is likely to maximize the likelihood. All right, so we are going to choose a word that has a higher likelihood. So, in other words we are going to compare these two probabilities of the word given by each of these distributions. But our guess must also be affected by the prior. So we also need to compare these two priors. Why? Because imagine if we adjust these probabilities. We're going to say, the probability of choosing a background model is almost 100 Now if we have that kind of strong prior, then that would affect your gas. You might think, well, wait a moment, maybe texter could have been from the background as well. Although the probability is very small here the prior is very high. So in the end, we have to combine the two. And the base formula provides us a solid and principle way of making this kind of guess to quantify that. So more specifically, let's think about the probability that this word text has been generated in fact from theta sub d. Well, in order for text to be generated from theta sub d, two things must happen. First, the theta sub d must have been selected. So, we have the selection probability here. And secondly we also have to actually have observed the text from the distribution. So, when we multiply the two together, we get the probability that text has in fact been generated from zero sub d. Similarly, for the background model and the probability of generating text is another product of similar form. Now we also introduced late in the variable z here to denote whether the word is from the background or the topic. When z is 0, it means it's from the topic, theta sub d. When it's 1, it means it's from the background, theta sub B. So now we have the probability that text is generated from each, then we can simply normalize them to have estimate of the probability that the word text is from theta sub d or from theta sub B. And equivalently the probability that Z is equal to zero, given that the observed evidence is text. So this is application of base rule. But this step is very crucial for understanding the EM hours. Because if we can do this, then we would be able to first, initialize the parameter values somewhat randomly. And then, we're going to take a guess of these Z values and all, which distributing has been used to generate which word. And the initialize the parameter values would allow us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which allows us to apply Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. And this prediction essentially helped us to separate words from the two distributions. Although we can't separate them for sure, but we can separate then probabilistically as shown here.", "Now, the idea that we talked about before for predicting the word distribution that has been used when we generate the word is it a predictor, the value of this hidden variable? And, so, the EM algorithm then, would work as follows. First, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values. In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters.", "So in this setting we have assumed the two numerals have equal probabilities and the background model is null. So what are the relevance of the statistics? Well these are the word counts. So assume we have just four words, and their counts are like this. And this is our background model that assigns high probabilities to common words like the. And in the first iteration, you can picture what will happen. Well first we initialize all the values. So here, this probability that we're interested in is normalized into a uniform distribution of all the words. And then the E-step would give us a guess of the distribution that has been used. That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm. As you can see in the last row where we show the log-likelihood, and the likelihood is increasing as we do the iteration. And note that these log-likelihood is negative because the probability is between 0 and 1 when you take a logarithm, it becomes a negative value. Now what's also interesting is, you'll note the last column. And these are the inverted word split. And these are the probabilities that a word is believed to have come from one distribution, in this case the topical distribution, all right. And you might wonder whether this would be also useful. Because our main goal is to estimate these word distributions. So this is our primary goal. We hope to have a more discriminative order of distribution. But the last column is also bi-product. This also can actually be very useful. You can think about that. We want to use, is to for example is to estimate to what extent this document has covered background words. And this, when we add this up or take the average we will kind of know to what extent it has covered background versus content was that are not explained well by the background.", "In the E-step we roughly [INAUDIBLE] how many there are by predicting values of useful hidden variables that we would use to simplify the estimation.

That still doesn't explain the purpose of that constant in front of $x^{\\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\\beta-1}$.\nIn fact, this constant just ensures that given the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ parameters, the Beta distribution still integrates to one over its support. As you probably recall, this is a necessity for a probability distribution.\nMathematically, we can write this as Note that the sum over the support of $x$ is the reciprocal of that constant. If we divide by it (multiply by reciprocal), we will get one as desired:\nIf you're proficient in calculus (or know how to use Wolfram Alpha or similar), you can confirm this fact for yourself.\nOne more note on the Beta distribution: its expected value is We'll see how this can be useful in a minute.

In such a collection, we can imagine potential topics such as government response, donation, and flooding of New Orleans.

Besides these themes, we also show three potentially different views of these three themes (topics): \\texttt{View1} is associated with a location context (Texas) and contains Texas-specific word distributions for all the three themes shown in the figure, which may reflect how the authors in Texas talk about these topics, which presumably would be different from how the authors in Illinois talk about them, which can be represented as a different view. Similarly, \\texttt{View2} is associated with a time context (July 2005), and \\texttt{View3} is associated with a context of author occupation (a sociologist).\n\nThe selection of topics when generating words in a document can also be influenced by the context of the document.

A main assumption is that those common words are generated using the background model, while the more discriminative content-bearing words are generated using the (unknown) topic word distribution as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:mixlm-background}. This is also the scenario that we used to motivate the use of the mixture model. Figure~\\ref{fig:1-topic-est} illustrates such a scenario. In this scenario, the only parameters unknown would be the topic word distribution $p(w|\\theta_d)$. Thus we have exactly the same number of parameters to estimate as in the case of a single unigram language model. Note that this is an example of customizing a general probabilistic model so that we can embed an unknown variable that we are interested in computing, while simplifying other parts of the model based on certain assumptions that we can make about them. That is, we assume that we have knowledge about other variables. Setting the background model to a fixed word distribution based on the maximum likelihood estimate of a unigram language model of a large sample of English text is not only feasible, but also desirable since our goal of designing such a generative model is to factor out the common words from the topic word distribution to be estimated. Feeding the model with a known background word distribution is a powerful technique to inject our knowledge about what words are counted as noise (stop words in this case). Similarly, the parameter $p(\\theta_B)$ can also be set based on our desired percentage of common words to factor out; the larger $p(\\theta_B)$ is set, the more common words would be removed from the topic word distribution.

For our application scenario (\\ie, factoring out common words), it is more appropriate to pre-set the background word distribution to bias the model toward allocating the common words to the background word distribution, and thus allow the topic word distribution to focus more on the content words as we will further explain."], "textbook/textdatabook/joint-analysis/social-network.jsonl/4": ["We now introduce a specific technique for analysis of text with network as context called a network supervised topic model. The general idea of such a model is illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:netplsa}. First, we can view any generative model (\\eg, PLSA) as defining an optimization problem where the variables are the parameters (denoted by $\\Lambda$ here in the figure), and the objective function is the likelihood function. From the perspective of mining text data, the estimated parameter values $\\Lambda^*$ can be regarded as the output of the mining algorithm based on the model. With this view, we can then potentially use any context information of the text data to impose constraints or preferences on the parameters so as to incorporate domain knowledge or any preferences dictated by the user or application. This would lead to a modification to the original optimization problem such that the likelihood is no longer the only objective to optimize.\nFollowing this thinking, the main idea of performing joint analysis of text and associated network context is to use the network to impose some constraints on the model parameters. For example, the text at adjacent nodes of the network can be assumed to cover similar topics. Indeed, in many cases, they do tend to cover similar topics; two authors collaborating with each other tend to publish papers on similar topics. Such a constraint or preference would essentially attempt to smooth the topic distributions on the graph or network so that adjacent nodes will have very similar topic distributions. This means we expect them to share a common distribution on the topics, or have just slight variations of the topic coverage distribution.\nWe add a network-induced regularizer to the likelihood objective function as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:netplsa}. That is, instead of optimizing the probability $p(\\text{TextData}|\\Lambda)$, we will optimize another function $f$, which combines the likelihood function $p(\\text{TextData}|\\Lambda)$ with a regularizer $r(\\Lambda, Network)$ defined based on whatever preferences we can derive from the network context. When optimizing the new objective function $f$, we would seek a compromise between parameter values that maximize the likelihood and those that satisfy our regularization constraints or preferences. Thus we may also view the impact of the network context as imposing some prior on the model parameters if we view the new optimization problem conceptually as Bayesian inference of parameter values, even though we do not have any explicitly defined prior distribution of parameters.\nNote that such an idea of regularizing likelihood function is quite general; indeed, the probabilistic model can be any generative model for text (such as a language model), and the network can be also any network or graph that connects the text objects that we hope to analyze. The regularizer can also be any regularizer that we would like to use to capture different heuristics suitable for a particular application; it may even be a combination of multiple regularizers. Finally, the function $f$ can also vary, allowing for many different ways to combine the likelihood function with the regularizers.

Clearly, if $\\lambda=0$, the model reduces to the standard PLSA\\@. In the regularizer, we see that the main constraint is the square loss defined on the difference of the topic selection probabilities of the two neighboring nodes $u$ and $v$: $\\sum_{j=1}^k (p(\\theta_j|u)-p(\\theta_j|v))^2$, which strongly prefers to give $p(\\theta_j|u)$ and $p(\\theta_j|v)$ similar values. In front of this regularization term, we see a weight $w(u,v)$, which is based on our network context where the edges may be weighted. This weight states that the more connected the two nodes are, the more important it is to ensure the two nodes have similar topics. In the case when the edges are not weighted, we may set $w(u,v)=1$ if there exists an edge between $u$ and $v$, and $w(u,v)=0$ otherwise, essentially to keep only the regularizer for edges that exist on the graph.

For coin flipping, we might want to assume a ``fair'' coin. If for some reason we believe that the coin may be biased, we can incorporate that knowledge as well. If we look at the estimate for $\\theta$, we can imagine how setting our hyperparameters can influence our prediction. Recall that $\\theta$ is the probability of heads; if we want to make our estimate biased towards more heads, we can set an $\\alpha > \\beta$ since this increases $\\theta$. This agrees with the mean of the prior as well: $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta}$. Setting the mean equal to $0.8$ means that our prior belief is a coin that lands heads $80\\%$ of the time. This can be accomplished with $\\alpha=4,\\beta=1$, or $\\alpha=16,\\beta=4$, or even $\\alpha=0.4, \\beta=0.1$. But what is the difference? Figure~\\ref{fig:betas} shows a comparison of the Beta distribution with varying parameters. It's also important to remember that a draw from a Beta prior $\\theta\\sim Beta(\\alpha,\\beta)$ gives us a \\emph{distribution}. Even though it's a single value on the range $[0,1]$, we are still using the prior to produce a probability distribution. Perhaps we'd like to choose a unimodal Beta prior, with a mean $0.8$. As we can see from Figure~\\ref{fig:betas}, the higher we set $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, the sharper the peak at $0.8$ will be. Looking at our parameter estimation, we can imagine the hyperparameters as pseudo counts---counts from the outcome of experiments already performed. The higher the hyperparameters are, the more pseudo counts we have, which means our prior is ``stronger''. As the total number of experiments increases, the sum $H+T$ also increases, which means we have less dependence on our priors. Initially though, when $H+T$ is relatively low, our prior plays a stronger role in the estimation of $\\theta$. As we all know, a small number of flips will not give an accurate estimate of the true $\\theta$---we'd like to see what our estimate becomes as our number of flips approaches infinity (or some ``large enough'' value). In this sense, our prior also \\emph{smooths} our estimation. Rather than the estimate fluctuating greatly initially, it could stay relatively smooth if we have a decent prior."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": ["The main idea of the EM algorithm is to guess (infer) which word is from which distribution based on a tentative estimate of parameters, and then use the inferred partitioning of words to improve the estimate of parameters, which, in turn, enables improved inference of the partitioning, leading to an iterative hill-climbing algorithm to improve the estimate of the parameters until hitting a local maximum.", "Understanding how to make such a Bayesian inference of which distribution has been used to generate a word based on a set of tentative parameter values is very crucial for understanding the EM algorithm. This is essentially the E-step of the EM algorithm where we use Bayes' rule to partition data and allocate all the data points among all the component models in the mixture model. Note that the E-step essentially helped us figure out which words have been generated from \\(\\theta_d\\) (and equivalently, which words have been generated from \\(\\theta_B\\)) except that it does not completely allocate a word to \\(\\theta_d\\) (or \\(\\theta_B\\)), but splits a word in between the two distributions. That is, \\(p(z=0|\\text{text})\\) tells us what percent of the count of \\emph{text} should be allocated to \\(\\theta_d\\), and thus contribute to the estimate of \\(\\theta_d\\).", "First, we initialize all the (unknown) parameters values randomly. This allows us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which further enables us to use Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. This prediction (\\ie, E-step) essentially helps us (probabilistically) separate words generated by the two distributions. Finally, we will collect all the probabilistically allocated counts of words belonging to our topic word distribution and normalize them into probabilities, which serve as an improved estimate of the parameters. The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Specifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.", "In the first iteration of the EM algorithm, we will apply the E-step to infer which of the two distributions has been used to generate each word, \\ie, to compute $p(z=0|w)$ and $p(z=1|w)$. We only showed $p(z=0|w)$, which is needed in our M-step ($p(z=1|w)=1-p(z=0|w)$). Clearly, $p(z=0|w)$ has different values for different words, and this is because these words have different probabilities in the background model and the initialized $\theta_d$. Thus, even though the two distributions are equally likely (by our prior) and our initial values for $p(w|\theta_d)$ form a uniform distribution, the inferred $p(z=0|w)$ would tend to give words with smaller probabilities according to $p(w|\theta_B)$ a higher probability. For example, $p(z=0|\text{text}) > p(z=0|\text{the})$.\nOnce we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words. For example, the count of \\emph{the} is 4, but since $p(z=0|\text{the})=0.33$, we would obtain a discounted count of \\emph{the}, $4\\cdot 0.33$, when estimating $p(\text{the}|\theta_d)$ in the M-step. Similarly, the adjusted count for \\emph{text} would be $4\\cdot 0.71$. After the M-step, $p(\text{text}|\theta_d)$ would be much higher than $p(\text{the}|\theta_d)$ as shown in the table (shown in the first column under Iteration 2). Those words that are believed to have come from the topic word distribution $\theta_d$ according to the E-step would have a higher probability. This new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values, leading to a new generation of probabilities for the $z$ values, which can be fed into another M-step to generate yet another generation of potentially improved estimate of $\theta_d$.\nIn the last row of the table, we show the log-likelihood after each iteration. Since each iteration would lead to a different generation of parameter estimates, it would also give a different value for the log-likelihood function. These log-likelihood values are all negative because the probability is between 0 and 1, which becomes a negative value after the logarithm transformation. We see that after each iteration, the log-likelihood value is increasing, showing that the EM algorithm is iteratively improving the estimated parameter values in a hill-climbing manner.", "Second, in the E-step, it would attempt to infer the values of the hidden variables based on the current generation of parameters, and obtain a probability distribution of hidden variables over all possible values of these hidden variables. Intuitively, this is to take a good guess of the values of the hidden variables. Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["Now this idea, however, doesn't work because we in practice, don't really know which word is from which distribution. But this gives us an idea of perhaps we can guess which word is from which distribution. Specifically, given all the parameters, can we infer the distribution a word is from?", "The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in.", "And then the E-step would give us a guess of the distribution that has been used. That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts.

We see that after each iteration, the log-likelihood value is increasing, showing that the EM algorithm is iteratively improving the estimated parameter values in a hill-climbing manner.", "Next, we provide some intuitive explanation why the EM algorithm will converge to a local maximum in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-opt}. Here we show the parameter $\\theta_d$ on the X-axis, and the Y-axis denotes the likelihood function value. This is an over-simplification since $\\theta_d$ is an $M$-dimensional vector, but the one-dimensional view makes it much easier to understand the EM algorithm. We see that in general, the original likelihood function (as a function of $\\theta_d$) may have multiple local maxima. The goal of computing the ML estimate is to find the global maximum, \\ie, the $\\theta_d$ value that makes the likelihood function reach it global maximum.\nThe EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm. It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. You might wonder why we don't work on finding an improved parameter value directly on the original likelihood function. Indeed, it is possible to do that, but in the EM algorithm, the auxiliary function is usually much easier to optimize than the original likelihood function, so in this sense, it reduces the problem into a somewhat simpler one.", "This process is repeated until convergence to a local maximum of the likelihood function.

This is generally a function of the (unknown) parameters, and the value of the function would vary according to the values of the parameters. Thus, we can attempt to find the parameter values that would maximize the value of this function (the likelihood) given data from the model. Such a way of obtaining parameters is called the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) as we've discussed previously. Sometimes, it is desirable to also incorporate some additional knowledge (a prior belief) about the parameters that we may have about a particular application. We can do this by using Bayesian estimation of parameters, which seeks a compromise of maximizing the probability of the observed data (maximum likelihood) and being consistent with the prior belief that we impose.\n\nNext, we see that our likelihood function is the probability of generating this whole document according to our model. In a unigram language model, we assume independence in generating each word so the probability of the document equals the product of the probability of each word in the document (the first line of the equation for the likelihood function). We can rewrite this product into a slightly different form by grouping the terms corresponding to the same word together so that the product would be over all the {\\em distinct} words in the vocabulary (instead of over all the positions of words in the document), which is shown in the second line of the equation for the likelihood function. Since some words might have repeated occurrences, when we use a product over the unique words we must also incorporate the count of a word $w_i$ in document $d$, which is denoted by $c(w_i,d)$. Although the product is taken over the entire vocabulary, it is clear that if a word did not occur in the document, it would have a zero count ($c(w_i,d)=0$), and that corresponding term would be essentially absent in the formula, thus the product is still essentially over.", "the words that actually occurred in the document. We often prefer such a form of the likelihood function that the product is over the entire vocabulary because it is convenient for deriving formulas for parameter estimation. Now that we have a well defined likelihood function, we will attempt to find the parameter values (\\ie, word probabilities) that maximize this likelihood function. Let's take a look at the maximum likelihood estimation problem more closely in Figure~\\ref{fig:ml-est}. The first line is the original optimization problem of finding the maximum likelihood estimate. The next line shows an equivalent optimization problem with the log-likelihood. The equivalence is due to the fact that the logarithm function results in a monotonic transformation of the original likelihood function and thus does not affect the solution of the optimization problem. Such a transformation is purely for mathematical convenience because after the logarithm transformation our function will become a sum instead of product; the sum makes it easier to take the derivative, which is often needed for finding the optimal solution of this function. Although simple, this log-likelihood function reflects some general characteristics of a log-likelihood function of some more complex generative models: At this point, our problem is a well defined mathematical optimization problem where the goal is to find the optimal solution of a constrained maximization problem. The objective function is the log-likelihood function and the constraint is that all the word probabilities must sum to one."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["On the y axis we see the likelihood function. So this curve is the original likelihood function, and this is the one that we hope to maximize. And we hope to find a c0 value at this point to maximize this. But in the case of Mitsumoto we cannot easily find an analytic solution to the problem. So, we have to resolve the numerical errors, and the EM algorithm is such an algorithm. It's a Hill-Climb algorithm. That would mean you start with some random guess. Let's say you start from here, that's your starting point. And then you try to improve this by moving this to another point where you can have a higher likelihood. So that's the ideal hill climbing. And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point. And that's why EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. Now, as you can imagine, when we have many local maxima, we also have to repeat the EM algorithm multiple times. In order to figure out which one is the actual global maximum.

It is equal to the joint probability distribution of the random sample evaluated at the given observations, and it is, thus, solely a function of parameters that index the family of those probability distributions.\nMapping from the parameter space to the real line, the likelihood function describes a hypersurface whose peak, if it exists, represents the combination of model parameter values that maximize the probability of drawing the sample actually obtained. The procedure for obtaining these arguments of the maximum of the likelihood function is known as maximum likelihood estimation, which for computational convenience is usually done using the natural logarithm of the likelihood, known as the log-likelihood function. Additionally, the shape and curvature of the likelihood surface represent information about the stability of the estimates, which is why the likelihood function is often plotted as part of a statistical analysis."], "wikipedia-17905": ["A likelihood function arises from a probability density function considered as a function of its distributional parameterization argument.

This is the basis for the widely used method of maximum likelihood."], "wikipedia-140806": ["In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a distribution by maximizing a likelihood function, so that under the assumed statistical model the observed data is most probable. The point in the parameter space that maximizes the likelihood function is called the maximum likelihood estimate. The logic of maximum likelihood is both intuitive and flexible, and as such the method has become a dominant means of statistical inference.\nIf the likelihood function is differentiable, the derivative test for determining maxima can be applied. In some cases, the first-order conditions of the likelihood function can be solved explicitly; for instance, the ordinary least squares estimator maximizes the likelihood of the linear regression model. Under most circumstances, however, numerical methods will be necessary to find the maximum of the likelihood function.\nFrom the point of view of Bayesian inference, MLE is a special case of maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) that assumes a uniform prior distribution of the parameters. In frequentist inference, MLE is a special case of an extremum estimator, with the objective function being the likelihood.\nSection::::Principles.\nFrom a statistical standpoint, the observations formula_1 are a random sample from an unknown population. The goal is to make inferences about the population that is most likely to have generated the sample, specifically the probability distribution corresponding to the population. Associated with each probability distribution is a unique vector formula_2 of parameters that index the probability distribution within a parametric family formula_3. As formula_4 changes in value, different probability distributions are generated. The idea of maximum likelihood is to re-express the joint probability of the sample data formula_5 as a likelihood function formula_6 that treats formula_4 as a variable. For independent and identically distributed random variables, the likelihood function is defined as\nand evaluated at the observed data sample. The goal is then to find the values of the model parameter that maximize the likelihood function over the parameter space formula_9. Intuitively, this selects the parameter values that make the observed data most probable. The problem is thus to find the supremum value of the likelihood function by choice of the parameter\nwhere the estimator formula_11 is function of the sample. A sufficient but not necessary condition for its existence is for the likelihood function to be continuous over a parameter space formula_9 that is compact. For an open formula_9 the likelihood function may increase without ever reaching a supremum value.\nIn practice, it is often convenient to work with the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, called the log-likelihood:\nSince the logarithm is a monotonic function, the maximum of formula_15 occurs at the same value of formula_4 as does the maximum of formula_17. If formula_15 is differentiable in formula_4, the necessary conditions for the occurrence of a maximum (or a minimum) are\nknown as the likelihood equations. For some models, these equations can be explicitly solved for formula_21, but in general no closed-form solution to the maximization problem is known or available, and an MLE can only be found via numerical optimization. Another problem is that in finite samples, there may exist multiple roots for the likelihood equations. Whether the identified root formula_21 of the likelihood equations is indeed a (local) maximum depends on whether the matrix of second-order partial and cross-partial derivatives, \nknown as the Hessian matrix is negative semi-definite at formula_21, which indicates local concavity.

In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$.

The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values.", "In the last row of the table, we show the log-likelihood after each iteration. Since each iteration would lead to a different generation of parameter estimates, it would also give a different value for the log-likelihood function. These log-likelihood values are all negative because the probability is between 0 and 1, which becomes a negative value after the logarithm transformation. We see that after each iteration, the log-likelihood value is increasing, showing that the EM algorithm is iteratively improving the estimated parameter values in a hill-climbing manner.", "Next, we provide some intuitive explanation why the EM algorithm will converge to a local maximum in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-opt}. Here we show the parameter $\\theta_d$ on the X-axis, and the Y-axis denotes the likelihood function value. This is an over-simplification since $\\theta_d$ is an $M$-dimensional vector, but the one-dimensional view makes it much easier to understand the EM algorithm. We see that in general, the original likelihood function (as a function of $\\theta_d$) may have multiple local maxima. The goal of computing the ML estimate is to find the global maximum, \\ie, the $\\theta_d$ value that makes the likelihood function reach it global maximum. The EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm. It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. You might wonder why we don't work on finding an improved parameter value directly on the original likelihood function. Indeed, it is possible to do that, but in the EM algorithm, the auxiliary function is usually much easier to optimize than the original likelihood function, so in this sense, it reduces the problem into a somewhat simpler one. Although the auxiliary function is generally easier to optimize, it does not always have an analytical solution, which means that the maximization of the auxiliary function may itself require another iterative process, which would be embedded in the overall iterative process of the EM algorithm.", "Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values. This process is repeated until convergence to a local maximum of the likelihood function. Note that although the likelihood function is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum, there is no guarantee that the parameters to be estimated always have a stable convergence to a particular set of values. That is, the parameters may oscillate even though the likelihood is increasing."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in. Okay, so, as I said, the bridge between the two is really the variable z, hidden variable, which indicates how likely this water is from the top water distribution, theta sub p. So, this slide has a lot of content and you may need to. Pause the reader to digest it. But this basically captures the essence of EM Algorithm. Start with initial values that are often random themself. And then we invoke E-step followed by M-step to get an improved setting of parameters.

First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess.

This is called \\emph{smoothing}, and smoothing has to do with improving the estimate by including the probabilities of unseen words. Considering this factor, a smoothed language model would be a more accurate representation of the actual document. Imagine you have seen abstract of a research paper; or, imagine a document is just an abstract. If we assume words that don't appear in the abstract have a probability of zero, that means sampling a word outside the abstract is impossible. Imagine the user who is interested in the topic of this abstract; the user might actually choose a word that is not in the abstract to use as query. In other words, if we had asked this author to write more, the author would have written the full text of the article, which contains words that don't appear in the abstract. So, smoothing the language model is attempting to try to recover the model for the whole article. Of course, we don't have written knowledge about any words not observed in the abstract, so that's why smoothing is actually a tricky problem. The key question here is what probability should be assigned to those unseen words. As one would imagine, there are many different approaches to solve this issue. One idea that's very useful for retrieval is to let the probability of an unseen word be proportional to its probability as given by a reference language model. That means if you don't observe the word in the corpus, we're going to assume that its probability is governed by another reference language model that we construct. It will tell us which unseen words have a higher probability than other unseen words. In the case of retrieval, a natural choice would be to take the collection LM as the reference LM\\@. That is to say if you don't observe a word in the document, we're going to assume that the probability of this word would be proportional to the probability of the word in the whole collection. More formally, we'll be estimating the probability of a word given a document as follows: If the word is seen in the document, then the probability would be a discounted MLE estimate $p_{seen}$. Otherwise, if the word is not seen in the document, we'll let the probability be proportional to the probability of the word in the collection $p(w|C)$, with the coefficient $\\alpha_d$ controlling the amount of probability mass that we assign to unseen words.

While these observations provided evidence against the proposed vocabulary problem, they also triggered a series of research investigating how and why tag proportions tended to converge over time. \n\nOne explanation for the stability was that there was an inherent propensity for users to \"imitate\" word use of others as they create tags. This propensity may act as a form of social cohesion that fosters the coherence of tag-topic relations in the system, and leads to stability in the system. Golder and Huberman showed that the stochastic urn model by Eggenberger and P\u00f3lya was useful in explaining how simple imitation behavior at the individual level could explain the converging usage patterns of tags. Specifically, convergence of tag choices was simulated by a process in which a colored ball was randomly selected from an urn and was replaced in the urn along with an additional ball of the same color, simulating the probabilistic nature of tag reuse. The simple model, however, does not explain why certain tags would to be \"imitated\" more often than others, and therefore cannot provide a realistic mechanism for tag choices and how social tags could be utilized as navigational cues during exploratory search, not to mention the obviously over-simplified representation of individual users by balls in an urn.\n\nOther research, using data from the social bookmarking website Del.icio.us, has shown that collaborative tagging systems exhibit a form of complex systems (or self-organizing) dynamics. Furthermore, although there is no central controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of individual users, the distributions of tags that describe different resources has been shown to converge over time to a stable power law distributions. Once such stable distributions form, examining the correlations between different tags can be used to construct simple folksonomy graphs, which can be efficiently partitioned to obtain a form of community or shared vocabularies. Such vocabularies can be seen as emerging from the decentralised actions of many users, as a form of crowdsourcing."], "wikipedia-50700194": ["The equation or its variable is said to be \"stable\" if from any set of initial conditions the variable's limit as time goes to infinity exists; this limit is called the \"steady state\".\n\nIn the solution equation\n\na term with real characteristic roots converges to 0 as grows indefinitely large if the absolute value of the characteristic root is less than 1.

These are {\\em prior} because they\nencode our belief about which distribution {\\em before} we even observe the word\n\\emph{text}; a prior that has very high $p(\\theta_d)$ would encourage us to lean\ntoward guessing $\\theta_d$ for any word. Such a prior is then updated by\nincorporating the data likelihood $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ and\n$p(\\text{text}|\\theta_B)$ so that we would favor a distribution that gives\n\\emph{text} a higher probability.\nIn the example shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-infer}, our prior says that each of\nthe two models is equally likely; thus, it is a non-informative prior (one with\nno bias). As a result, our inference of which distribution has been used to\ngenerate a word would solely be based on $p(w|\\theta_d)$ and $p(w|\\theta_B)$.\nSince $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ is much larger than $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_B)$,\nwe can conclude that $\\theta_d$ is much more likely the distribution that has\nbeen used to generate \\emph{text}. In general, our prior may be biased toward a\nparticular distribution. Indeed, a heavily-biased prior can even dominate over\nthe data likelihood to essentially dictate the decision. For example, imagine\nour prior says $p(\\theta_B)=0.99999999$, then our inference result would say\nthat \\emph{text} is more likely generated by $\\theta_B$ than by $\\theta_d$ even\nthough $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ is much higher than $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_B)$,\ndue to the very strong prior. Bayes' Rule provides us a principled way of\ncombining the prior and data likelihood.\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:em-infer}, we introduced a binary latent variable $z$ here to\ndenote whether the word is from the background or the topic. When $z$ is 0, it\nmeans it's from the topic, $\\theta_d$; when it's 1, it means it's from the\nbackground, $\\theta_B$. The posterior probability $p(z=0|w=\\text{text}) $\nformally captures our guess about which distribution has been used to generate\nthe word \\emph{text}, and it is seen to be proportional to the product of the\nprior $p(\\theta_d)$ and the likelihood $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$, which is\nintuitively very meaningful since in order to generate \\emph{text} from\n$\\theta_d$, we must first choose $\\theta_d$ (as opposed to $\\theta_B$), which is\ncaptured by $p(\\theta_d)$, and then obtain word \\emph{text} from the selected\n$\\theta_d$, which is captured by $p(w|\\theta_d)$.", "Next, we provide some intuitive explanation why the EM algorithm will converge\nto a local maximum in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-opt}. Here we show the parameter\n$\\theta_d$ on the X-axis, and the Y-axis denotes the likelihood function value.\nThis is an over-simplification since $\\theta_d$ is an $M$-dimensional vector,\nbut the one-dimensional view makes it much easier to understand the EM\nalgorithm. We see that in general, the original likelihood function (as a\nfunction of $\\theta_d$) may have multiple local maxima.

Here we see that initially the two curves tracked each other very well.\nInterestingly, later, the topic of New Orleans was mentioned again but oil\nprices was not. This turns out to be the time period when another hurricane\n(Hurricane Rita) hit the region, which apparently triggered more discussion\nabout the flooding of the city, but not the discussion of oil price.\nThe bottom figure shows the coverage of the topic about flooding of the city New\nOrleans by blog article authors in different locations (different states in US).\nWe see that the topic was initially heavily covered by authors in the victim\nareas (\\eg, Louisiana), but the topic was then picked up by the authors in\nTexas, which might be explained by the move of people from the state of\nLouisiana to Texas. Thus, these topical trends not only are themselves useful\nfor revealing the topics and their dynamics over time, but also enable\ncomparative analysis of topics across different contexts to help discover\ninteresting patterns and potentially interesting events associated with the\npatterns.\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:spatial}, we show spatiotemporal patterns of the coverage of\nthe topic of government response in the same data set of blog articles about\nHurricane Katrina.

Since $\\sum_{w\\in V}p(w|C)=1$, we can add a\n$\\mu$ in the denominator, which is the total number of pseudocounts we added for\neach $w$ in the numerator.\nLet's also take a look at this specific example again. For the word \\emph{text},\nwe will have ten counts that we actually observe but we also added some\npseudocounts which are proportional to the probability of \\emph{text} in the\nentire corpus. Say we set $\\mu=3000$, meaning we will add 3000 extra word counts\ninto our smoothed model. We want some portion of the 3000 counts to be allocated\nto \\emph{text}; since $p(\\text{text}|C)=0.001$, we'll assign $0.001\\cdot 3000$\ncounts to that word.

One group will be explained by the background model. The other group will be explained by the unknown topical order. After all this is the basic idea of the mixture model. But, suppose we actually know which word is from which distribution. So that would mean, for example, these words, the, is, and we, are known to be from this background origin, distribution. On the other hand, the other words, text mining, clustering, etcetera are known to be from the topic word, distribution as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-known-dist}. If you can see the color, that these are showing blue. These blue words are, they are assumed to be from the topic word, distribution. If we already know how to separate these words. Then the problem of estimating the word distribution would be extremely simple, right? If you think about this for a moment, you'll realize that, well, we can simply take all these words that are known to be from this word distribution, see that's a d and normalize them. So indeed this problem would be very easy to solve if we had known which words are from which it is written precisely. And this is in fact, making this model no longer a mystery model because we can already observe which of these distribution has been used to generate which part of the data. So we, actually go back to the single order distribution problem. And in this case, let's call these words that are known to be from theta d, a pseudo document of d prime. And now all we have to do is just normalize these word accounts for each word, w sub i. And that's fairly straightforward, and it's just dictated by the maximum estimator. Now, this idea, however, doesn't work because we in practice, don't really know which word is from which distribution. But this gives us an idea of perhaps we can guess which word is from which distribution. Specifically, given all the parameters, can we infer the distribution a word is from?", "Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter.", "So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability.", "Now here data augmentation is done probabilistically. That means, we're not going to just say exactly what's the value of a hidden variable. But we're going to have a probability distribution over the possible values of these hidden variables. So this causes a split of counts of events probabilistically. And in our case we'll split the word counts between the two distributions."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": ["According to our mixture model, we can imagine that the words in the text data can be partitioned into two groups. One group will be explained (generated) by the background model. The other group will be explained by the unknown topical model (the topic word distribution). The challenge in computing the ML estimate is that we do not know this partition due to the possibility of generating a word using either of the two distributions in the mixture model.\nIf we actually know which word is from which distribution, computation of the ML estimate would be trivial as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-known-dist}, where $d'$ is used to denote the pseudo document that is composed of all the words in document $d$ that are known to be generated by $\\theta_d$, and the ML estimate of $\\theta_d$ is seen to be simply the normalized word frequency in this pseudo document $d'$. That is, we can simply pool together all the words generated from $\\theta_d$, compute the count of each word, and then normalize the count by the total counts of all the words in such a pseudo document. In such a case, our mixture model is really just two independent unigram language models, which can thus be estimated separately based on the data points generated by each of them.\nUnfortunately, the real situation is such that we don't really know which word is from which distribution. The main idea of the EM algorithm is to guess (infer) which word is from which distribution based on a tentative estimate of parameters, and then use the inferred partitioning of words to improve the estimate of parameters, which, in turn, enables improved inference of the partitioning, leading to an iterative hill-climbing algorithm to improve the estimate of the parameters until hitting a local maximum.", "Understanding how to make such a Bayesian inference of which distribution has been used to generate a word based on a set of tentative parameter values is very crucial for understanding the EM algorithm. This is essentially the E-step of the EM algorithm where we use Bayes' rule to partition data and allocate all the data points among all the component models in the mixture model. Note that the E-step essentially helped us figure out which words have been generated from \u03b8_d (and equivalently, which words have been generated from \u03b8_B) except that it does not completely allocate a word to \u03b8_d (or \u03b8_B), but splits a word in between the two distributions. That is, p(z=0|text) tells us what percent of the count of text should be allocated to \u03b8_d, and thus contribute to the estimate of \u03b8_d.", "Specifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.\nIn the M-step, we adjust the count $c(w,d)$ based on $p(z=0|w)$ (\\ie, probability that the word $w$ is indeed from $\theta_d$) so as to obtain a discounted count $c(w,d)p(z=0|w)$ which can be interpreted as the expected count of the event that word $w$ is generated from $\theta_B$. Similarly, $\theta_B$ has its own share of the count, which is $c(w,d)p(z=1|w) = c(w,d)[1-p(z=0|w)]$, and we have showing that all the counts of word $w$ have been split between the two distributions.\nThus, the M-step is simply to normalize these discounted counts for all the words to obtain a probability distribution over all the words, which can then be regarded as our improved estimate of $p(w|\theta_d)$.", "Once we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words. For example, the count of \\emph{the} is 4, but since $p(z=0|\\text{the})=0.33$, we would obtain a discounted count of \\emph{the}, $4\\cdot 0.33$, when estimating $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ in the M-step. Similarly, the adjusted count for \\emph{text} would be $4\\cdot 0.71$. After the M-step, $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ would be much higher than $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ as shown in the table (shown in the first column under Iteration 2).

The amount of split counts of $w$ that $\theta_j$ can get is determined based on the inferred likelihood that $w$ is generated by topic $\theta_j$. Once we have such a split count of each word for each distribution, we can easily pool together these split counts to re-estimate both $\\pi$ and $p(w|\theta)$ as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. To re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$, the probability that document $d$ covers topic $\theta_j$, we would simply collect all the split counts of words in document $d$ that belong to each $\theta_j$, and then normalize these counts among all the $k$ topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\theta_j)$, we would collect the split counts of a word toward $\theta_j$ from all the documents in the collection, and then normalize these counts among all the words.", "In the M-step, we will also collect the relevant counts and then normalize appropriately to obtain re-estimates of various parameters. We would use the estimated probability distribution $p(z_{d,w})$ to split the count of word $w$ in document $d$ among all the topics. Note that the same word would generally be split in different ways in different documents. Once we split the counts for all the words in this way, we can aggregate the split counts and normalize them. For example, to re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$ (coverage of topic $\theta_j$ in document $d$), the relevant counts would be the counts of words in $d$ that have been allocated to topic $\theta_j$, and the normalizer would be the sum of all such counts over all the topics so that after normalization, we would obtain a probability distribution over all the topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\theta_j)$, the relevant counts are the sum of all the split counts of word $w$ in all the documents.

A specialized textbook would likely explain this by:  \n   - Defining the mathematical framework (e.g., weighted contributions to each distribution).  \n   - Providing examples (e.g., EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures).  \n   - Highlighting significance: It enables modeling complex data-generating processes, handling uncertainty in assignments, or improving parameter estimation.  \n\n   The textbook would clarify both the *how* (methods) and *why* (applications, e.g., in biology, NLP, or finance).", "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["Now this started with the idea of separating the words in the text data into two groups. One group will be explained by the background model. The other group will be explained by the unknown topical order. After all this is the basic idea of the mixture model. But, suppose we actually know which word is from which distribution. So that would mean, for example, these words, the, is, and we, are known to be from this background origin, distribution. On the other hand, the other words, text mining, clustering, etcetera are known to be from the topic word, distribution as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-known-dist}. If you can see the color, that these are showing blue. These blue words are, they are assumed to be from the topic word, distribution. If we already know how to separate these words. Then the problem of estimating the word distribution would be extremely simple, right? If you think about this for a moment, you'll realize that, well, we can simply take all these words that are known to be from this word distribution, see that's a d and normalize them. So indeed this problem would be very easy to solve if we had known which words are from which it is written precisely. And this is in fact, making this model no longer a mystery model because we can already observe which of these distribution has been used to generate which part of the data.", "So, in other words we are going to compare these two probabilities of the word given by each of these distributions. But our guess must also be affected by the prior. So we also need to compare these two priors. Why? Because imagine if we adjusted these probabilities. We're going to say, the probability of choosing a background model is almost 100. Now if we have that kind of strong prior, then that would affect your gas. You might think, well, wait a moment, maybe texter could have been from the background as well. Although the probability is very small here the prior is very high. So in the end, we have to combine the two. And the base formula provides us a solid and principle way of making this kind of guess to quantify that. So more specifically, let's think about the probability that this word text has been generated in fact from theta sub d. Well, in order for text to be generated from theta sub d, two things must happen. First, the theta sub d must have been selected. So, we have the selection probability here. And secondly we also have to actually have observed the text from the distribution. So, when we multiply the two together, we get the probability that text has in fact been generated from zero sub d. Similarly, for the background model and the probability of generating text is another product of similar form. Now we also introduced late in the variable z here to denote whether the word is from the background or the topic. When z is 0, it means it's from the topic, theta sub d. When it's 1, it means it's from the background, theta sub B. So now we have the probability that text is generated from each, then we can simply normalize them to have estimate of the probability that the word text is from theta sub d or from theta sub B. And equivalently the probability that Z is equal to zero, given that the observed evidence is text. So this is application of base rule. But this step is very crucial for understanding the EM hours. Because if we can do this, then we would be able to first, initialize the parameter values somewhat randomly. And then, we're going to take a guess of these Z values and all, which distributing has been used to generate which word. And the initialize the parameter values would allow us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which allows us to apply Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. And this prediction essentially helped us to separate words from the two distributions. Although we can't separate them for sure, but we can separate then probabilistically as shown here.", "the idea that we talked about before for predicting the word distribution that has been used when we generate the word is it a predictor, the value of this hidden variable? And, so, the EM algorithm then, would work as follows. First, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values. In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in. Okay, so, as I said, the bridge between the two is really the variable z, hidden variable, which indicates how likely this water is from the top water distribution, theta sub p.", "So in this setting we have assumed the two numerals have equal probabilities and the background model is null. So what are the relevance of the statistics? Well these are the word counts. So assume we have just four words, and their counts are like this. And this is our background model that assigns high probabilities to common words like the. And in the first iteration, you can picture what will happen. Well first we initialize all the values. So here, this probability that we're interested in is normalized into a uniform distribution of all the words. And then the E-step would give us a guess of the distribution that has been used. That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm. As you can see in the last row where we show the log-likelihood, and the likelihood is increasing as we do the iteration. And note that these log-likelihood is negative because the probability is between 0 and 1 when you take a logarithm, it becomes a negative value. Now what's also interesting is, you'll note the last column. And these are the inverted word split. And these are the probabilities that a word is believed to have come from one distribution, in this case the topical distribution, all right. And you might wonder whether this would be also useful. Because our main goal is to estimate these word distributions. So this is our primary goal. We hope to have a more discriminative order of distribution. But the last column is also bi-product. This also can actually be very useful. You can think about that. We want to use, is to for example is to estimate to what extent this document has covered background words. And this, when we add this up or take the average we will kind of know to what extent it has covered background versus content was that are not explained well by the background.", "Now here data augmentation\nis done probabilistically.\nThat means,\nwe're not going to just say exactly\nwhat's the value of a hidden variable.\nBut we're going to have a probability\ndistribution over the possible values of\nthese hidden variables.\nSo this causes a split of counts\nof events probabilistically.\nAnd in our case we'll split the word\ncounts between the two distributions."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": ["According to our mixture model, we can imagine that the words in the text data can be partitioned into two groups. One group will be explained (generated) by the background model. The other group will be explained by the unknown topical model (the topic word distribution). The challenge in computing the ML estimate is that we do not know this partition due to the possibility of generating a word using either of the two distributions in the mixture model.\n\nIf we actually know which word is from which distribution, computation of the ML estimate would be trivial as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-known-dist}, where $d'$ is used to denote the pseudo document that is composed of all the words in document $d$ that are known to be generated by $\\theta_d$, and the ML estimate of $\\theta_d$ is seen to be simply the normalized word frequency in this pseudo document $d'$. That is, we can simply pool together all the words generated from $\\theta_d$, compute the count of each word, and then normalize the count by the total counts of all the words in such a pseudo document. In such a case, our mixture model is really just two independent unigram language models, which can thus be estimated separately based on the data points generated by each of them.\n\nUnfortunately, the real situation is such that we don't really know which word is from which distribution. The main idea of the EM algorithm is to guess (infer) which word is from which distribution based on a tentative estimate of parameters, and then use the inferred partitioning of words to improve the estimate of parameters, which, in turn, enables improved inference of the partitioning, leading to an iterative hill-climbing algorithm to improve the estimate of the parameters until hitting a local maximum.", "In Figure~\\ref{fig:em-infer}, we introduced a binary latent variable $z$ here to denote whether the word is from the background or the topic. When $z$ is 0, it means it's from the topic, $\\theta_d$; when it's 1, it means it's from the background, $\\theta_B$. The posterior probability $p(z=0|w=\\text{text}) $ formally captures our guess about which distribution has been used to generate the word \\emph{text}, and it is seen to be proportional to the product of the prior $p(\\theta_d)$ and the likelihood $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$, which is intuitively very meaningful since in order to generate \\emph{text} from $\\theta_d$, we must first choose $\\theta_d$ (as opposed to $\\theta_B$), which is captured by $p(\\theta_d)$, and then obtain word \\emph{text} from the selected $\\theta_d$, which is captured by $p(w|\\theta_d)$. Understanding how to make such a Bayesian inference of which distribution has been used to generate a word based on a set of tentative parameter values is very crucial for understanding the EM algorithm. This is essentially the E-step of the EM algorithm where we use Bayes' rule to partition data and allocate all the data points among all the component models in the mixture model. Note that the E-step essentially helped us figure out which words have been generated from $\\theta_d$ (and equivalently, which words have been generated from $\\theta_B$) except that it does not completely allocate a word to $\\theta_d$ (or $\\theta_B$), but splits a word in between the two distributions. That is, $p(z=0|\\text{text})$ tells us what percent of the count of \\emph{text} should be allocated to $\\theta_d$, and thus contribute to the estimate of $\\theta_d$. This way, we", "Specifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.\nIn the M-step, we adjust the count $c(w,d)$ based on $p(z=0|w)$ (\\ie, probability that the word $w$ is indeed from $\\theta_d$) so as to obtain a discounted count $c(w,d)p(z=0|w)$ which can be interpreted as the expected count of the event that word $w$ is generated from $\\theta_B$. Similarly, $\\theta_B$ has its own share of the count, which is $c(w,d)p(z=1|w) = c(w,d)[1-p(z=0|w)]$, and we have\nshowing that all the counts of word $w$ have been split between the two distributions.", "The computation of EM starts with preparation of relevant word counts. Here we assume that we have just four words, and their counts in the observed text data are shown in the second column of the table. The EM algorithm then initializes all the parameters to be estimated. In our case, we set all the probabilities to $0.25$ in the fourth column of the table.\nIn the first iteration of the EM algorithm, we will apply the E-step to infer which of the two distributions has been used to generate each word, \\ie, to compute $p(z=0|w)$ and $p(z=1|w)$. We only showed $p(z=0|w)$, which is needed in our M-step ($p(z=1|w)=1-p(z=0|w)$). Clearly, $p(z=0|w)$ has different values for different words, and this is because these words have different probabilities in the background model and the initialized $\\theta_d$. Thus, even though the two distributions are equally likely (by our prior) and our initial values for $p(w|\\theta_d)$ form a uniform distribution, the inferred $p(z=0|w)$ would tend to give words with smaller probabilities according to $p(w|\\theta_B)$ a higher probability. For example, $p(z=0|\\text{text}) > p(z=0|\\text{the})$.\nOnce we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words. For example, the count of \\emph{the} is 4, but since $p(z=0|\\text{the})=0.33$, we would obtain a discounted count of \\emph{the}, $4\\cdot 0.33$, when estimating $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ in the M-step. Similarly, the adjusted count for \\emph{text} would be $4\\cdot 0.71$. After the M-step, $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ would be much higher than $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ as shown in the table (shown in the first column under Iteration 2). Those words that are believed to have come from the topic word distribution $\\theta_d$ according to the E-step would have a higher probability."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/plsa.jsonl/15": ["Different from the simple mixture model discussed earlier, the model here includes $k$ component models, each of which represents a distinct topic and can be used to generate a word in the observed text data. Adding the background model $\\theta_B$, we thus have a total of $k+1$ component unigram language models in PLSA\\footnote{The original PLSA~\\cite{plsa} did not include a background language model, thus it gives common words high probabilities in the learned topics if such common words are not removed in the preprocessing stage.}. As in the case of the simple mixture model, the process of generating a word still consists of two steps. The first is to choose a component model to use; this decision is controlled by both a parameter $\\lambda_B$ (denoting the probability of choosing the background model) and a set of $\\pi_{d,i}$ (denoting the probability of choosing topic $\\theta_i$ {\\em if} we decided not to use the background model). If we do not use the background model, we must choose one from the $k$ topics, which has the constraint $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\pi_{d_i}=1$. Thus, the probability of choosing the background model is $\\lambda_B$ while the probability of choosing topic $\\theta_i$ is $(1-\\lambda_B)\\pi_{d,i}$. Once we decide which component word distribution to use, the second step in the generation process is simply to draw a word from the selected distribution, exactly the same as in the simple mixture model.", "Specifically, the probability of observing a word from the background distribution is $\\lambda_B p(w|\\theta_B)$, while the probability of observing a word from a topic $\\theta_j$ is $(1-\\lambda_B) \\pi_{d,j} p(w|\\theta_j)$. The probability of observing the word regardless of which distribution is used, $p_d(w)$, is just a sum of all these cases.", "The M-step is also similar to that in the simple mixture model. We show the equations in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. We see that a key component in the two equations, for re-estimating $\\pi$ and $p(w|\\theta)$ respectively, is $c(w,d)(1-p(z_{d,w}=B)p(z_{d,w}=j)$, which can be interpreted as the allocated counts of $w$ to topic $\\theta_j$. Intuitively, we use the inferred distribution of $z$ values from the E-step to split the counts of $w$ among all the distributions. The amount of split counts of $w$ that $\\theta_j$ can get is determined based on the inferred likelihood that $w$ is generated by topic $\\theta_j$.\nOnce we have such a split count of each word for each distribution, we can easily pool together these split counts to re-estimate both $\\pi$ and $p(w|\\theta)$ as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. To re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$, the probability that document $d$ covers topic $\\theta_j$, we would simply collect all the split counts of words in document $d$ that belong to each $\\theta_j$, and then normalize these counts among all the $k$ topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, we would collect the split counts of a word toward $\\theta_j$ from all the documents in the collection, and then normalize these counts among all the words. Note that the normalizers are very different in these two cases, which are directly related to the constraints we have on these parameters. In the case of re-estimation of $\\pi$, the constraint is that the $\\pi$ values must sum to one for each document, thus our normalizer has been chosen to ensure that the re-estimated values of $\\pi$ indeed sum to one for each document. The same is true for the re-estimation of $p(w|\\theta)$, where our normalizer allows us to obtain a word distribution for each topic.", "In the M-step, we will also collect the relevant counts and then normalize appropriately to obtain re-estimates of various parameters. We would use the estimated probability distribution $p(z_{d,w})$ to split the count of word $w$ in document $d$ among all the topics. Note that the same word would generally be split in different ways in different documents. Once we split the counts for all the words in this way, we can aggregate the split counts and normalize them. For example, to re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$ (coverage of topic $\\theta_j$ in document $d$), the relevant counts would be the counts of words in $d$ that have been allocated to topic $\\theta_j$, and the normalizer would be the sum of all such counts over all the topics so that after normalization, we would obtain a probability distribution over all the topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, the relevant counts are the sum of all the split counts of word $w$ in all the documents. These aggregated counts would then be normalized by the sum of such aggregated counts over all the words in the vocabulary so that after normalization, we again would obtain a distribution, this time over all the words rather than all the topics."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-10177813": 1, "wikipedia-31475137": 1, "wikipedia-31135791": 1, "wikipedia-4226251": 1, "wikipedia-27310834": 1, "wikipedia-51718327": 1, "wikipedia-30284": 1, "wikipedia-11512614": 1, "wikipedia-26685": 1, "wikipedia-23009617": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/background/prob-stats.jsonl/19": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/bayesian-stats.jsonl/21": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/bayesian-stats.jsonl/25": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/background/prob-stats.jsonl/16": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/word-association/syntagmatic.jsonl/20": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/issues.jsonl/3": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/bayesian-stats.jsonl/22": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/plsa.jsonl/15": 3}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-10177813": 1, "wikipedia-31475137": 1, "wikipedia-31135791": 2, "wikipedia-4226251": 1, "wikipedia-27310834": 1, "wikipedia-51718327": 1, "wikipedia-30284": 1, "wikipedia-11512614": 1, "wikipedia-26685": 1, "wikipedia-23009617": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/background/prob-stats.jsonl/19": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/bayesian-stats.jsonl/21": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/bayesian-stats.jsonl/25": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/background/prob-stats.jsonl/16": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/word-association/syntagmatic.jsonl/20": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/search-engine-eval/issues.jsonl/3": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/bayesian-stats.jsonl/22": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/plsa.jsonl/15": 3}}}

In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data.

We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in.", "Well first we initialize all the values. So here, this probability that we're interested in is normalized into a uniform distribution of all the words. And then the E-step would give us a guess of the distribution that has been used. That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values.

We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point.

This allows us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which further enables us to use Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. This prediction (\\ie, E-step) essentially helps us (probabilistically) separate words generated by the two distributions. Finally, we will collect all the probabilistically allocated counts of words belonging to our topic word distribution and normalize them into probabilities, which serve as an improved estimate of the parameters. The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. \nSpecifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation. \nThus, the M-step is simply to normalize these discounted counts for all the words to obtain a probability distribution over all the words, which can then be regarded as our improved estimate of $p(w|\\theta_d)$. Note that in the M-step, if $p(z=0|w)=1$ for all words, we would simply compute the simple single unigram language model based on all the observed words (which makes sense since the E-step would have told us that there is no chance that any word has been generated from the background).", "Thus the M-step is seen to use the $n$-th generation of parameters together with the newly inferred $z$ values to obtain a new $n+1$-th generation of parameters (\\ie, $p^{n+1}(w|\theta_d)$).\n\nIn the first iteration of the EM algorithm, we will apply the E-step to infer which of the two distributions has been used to generate each word, \\ie, to compute $p(z=0|w)$ and $p(z=1|w)$. We only showed $p(z=0|w)$, which is needed in our M-step ($p(z=1|w)=1-p(z=0|w)$). Clearly, $p(z=0|w)$ has different values for different words, and this is because these words have different probabilities in the background model and the initialized $\theta_d$. Thus, even though the two distributions are equally likely (by our prior) and our initial values for $p(w|\theta_d)$ form a uniform distribution, the inferred $p(z=0|w)$ would tend to give words with smaller probabilities according to $p(w|\theta_B)$ a higher probability.\n\nOnce we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words. For example, the count of \\emph{the} is 4, but since $p(z=0|\text{the})=0.33$, we would obtain a discounted count of \\emph{the}, $4\\cdot 0.33$, when estimating $p(\text{the}|\theta_d)$ in the M-step. Similarly, the adjusted count for \\emph{text} would be $4\\cdot 0.71$.

So we're going to predict for a word, whether the word has come from one of these k plus one distributions. This equation allows us to predict the probability that the word w in document d is generated from topic zero sub j. And the bottom one is the predicted probability that this word has been generated from the background. Note that we use document d here to index the word. Why? Because whether a word is from a particular topic actually depends on the document. Can you see why? Well, it's through the pi's. The pi's are tied to each document. Each document can have potentially different pi's, right. The pi's will then affect our prediction. So, the pi's are here. And this depends on the document. And that might give a different guess for a word in different documents, and that's desirable. In both cases we are using the Baye's Rule, as I explained, basically assessing the likelihood of generating word from each of this division and there's normalize. What about the m step? See Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. Well, we may recall the m step is we take advantage of the inferred z values. To split the counts. And then collected the right counts to re-estimate the parameters. So in this case, we can re-estimate our coverage of probability. And this is re-estimated based on collecting all the words in the document. And that's why we have the count of the word in document. And sum over all the words. And then we're going to look at to what extent this word belongs to the topic theta sub j. And this part is our guess from each step. This tells us how likely this word is actually from theta sub j. And when we multiply them together, we get the discounted count that's located for topic theta sub j. And when we normalize this over all the topics, we get the distribution of all the topics to indicate the coverage. And similarly, the bottom one is the estimated probability of word for a topic. And in this case we are using exact the same count, you can see this is the same discounted account, ] it tells us to what extend we should allocate this word [INAUDIBLE] but then normalization is different. Because in this case we are interested in the word distribution, so we simply normalize this over all the words. This is different, in contrast here we normalize the amount all the topics. It would be useful to take a comparison between the two. This give us different distributions. And these tells us how to improve the parameters. And as I just explained, in both the formula is we have a maximum estimate based on allocated word counts [INAUDIBLE].", "So, in terms of computation of this EM algorithm, we can actually just keep accounting various events and then normalize them. And when we thinking this way, we also have a more concise way of presenting the EM Algorithm. It actually helps us better understand the formulas. So as a algorithm we first initialize all the unknown perimeters randomly, all right. So, in our case, we are interested in all of those coverage perimeters, pi's and awarded distributions [INAUDIBLE], and we just randomly normalize them. This is the initialization step and then we will repeat until likelihood converges. Now how do we know whether likelihood converges? We can do compute likelihood at each step and compare the current likelihood with the previous likelihood. If it doesn't change much and we're going to say it stopped, right. So, in each step we're going to do e-step and m-step. In the e-step we're going to do augment the data by predicting the hidden variables. In this case, the hidden variable, z sub d, w, indicates whether the word w in d is from a topic or background. And if it's from a topic, which topic. So if you look at the e-step formulas, essentially we're actually normalizing these counts, sorry, these probabilities of observing the word from each distribution. So you can see, basically the prediction of word from topic zero sub j is based on the probability of selecting that theta sub j as a word distribution to generate the word. Multiply by the probability of observing the word from that distribution. And I said it's proportional to this because in the implementation of EM algorithm you can keep counter for this quantity, and in the end it just normalizes it. So the normalization here is over all the topics and then you would get a probability. Now, in the m-step, we do the same, and we are going to collect these. Allocated account for each topic. And we split words among the topics. And then we're going to normalize them in different ways to obtain the real estimate. So for example, we can normalize among all the topics to get the re-estimate of pi, the coverage. Or we can re-normalize based on all the words. And that would give us a word distribution.

The EM algorithm alternates between the E-step (computing expected values of latent variables given the current parameters) and the M-step (maximizing the likelihood to update the parameters). A specialized textbook would detail this process, including formulas for specific models (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models).", "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/13": ["Algorithmically, the basic idea of EM is to start with some initial guess of the\nparameter values $\\theta^{(0)}$ and then iteratively search for better values\nfor the parameters.

Now take the expectation of this equation w.r.t. the\nconditional distribution of the hidden variable given the data $X$ and the\ncurrent estimate of parameters $\\theta^{(n)}$, i.e., $p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)}$.

In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in.", "So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": ["First, we initialize all the (unknown) parameters values randomly. This allows us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which further enables us to use Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. This prediction (\\ie, E-step) essentially helps us (probabilistically) separate words generated by the two distributions. Finally, we will collect all the probabilistically allocated counts of words belonging to our topic word distribution and normalize them into probabilities, which serve as an improved estimate of the parameters. The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values.", "the M-step is seen to use the $n$-th generation of parameters together with the\nnewly inferred $z$ values to obtain a new $n+1$-th generation of parameters\n(\\ie, $p^{n+1}(w|\\theta_d)$).\n\nIn the first iteration of the EM algorithm, we will apply the E-step to infer\nwhich of the two distributions has been used to generate each word, \\ie, to\ncompute $p(z=0|w)$ and $p(z=1|w)$.

At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$.", "First, it would randomly initialize all the parameters to be estimated.

In the example shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-infer}, our prior says that each of the two models is equally likely; thus, it is a non-informative prior (one with no bias). As a result, our inference of which distribution has been used to generate a word would solely be based on $p(w|\\theta_d)$ and $p(w|\\theta_B)$. Since $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ is much larger than $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_B)$, we can conclude that $\\theta_d$ is much more likely the distribution that has been used to generate \\emph{text}. In general, our prior may be biased toward a particular distribution. Indeed, a heavily-biased prior can even dominate over the data likelihood to essentially dictate the decision. For example, imagine our prior says $p(\\theta_B)=0.99999999$, then our inference result would say that \\emph{text} is more likely generated by $\\theta_B$ than by $\\theta_d$ even though $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ is much higher than $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_B)$, due to the very strong prior. Bayes' Rule provides us a principled way of combining the prior and data likelihood. In Figure~\\ref{fig:em-infer}, we introduced a binary latent variable $z$ here to denote whether the word is from the background or the topic. When $z$ is 0, it means it's from the topic, $\\theta_d$; when it's 1, it means it's from the background, $\\theta_B$. The posterior probability $p(z=0|w=\\text{text}) $ formally captures our guess about which distribution has been used to generate the word \\emph{text}, and it is seen to be proportional to the product of the prior $p(\\theta_d)$ and the likelihood $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$, which is intuitively very meaningful since in order to generate \\emph{text} from $\\theta_d$, we must first choose $\\theta_d$ (as opposed to $\\theta_B$), which is captured by $p(\\theta_d)$, and then obtain word \\emph{text} from the selected $\\theta_d$, which is captured by $p(w|\\theta_d)$. Understanding how to make such a Bayesian inference of which distribution has been used to generate a word based on a set of tentative parameter values is very crucial for understanding the EM algorithm. This is essentially the E-step of the EM algorithm where we use Bayes' rule to partition data and allocate all the data points among all the component models in the mixture model. Note that the E-step essentially helped us figure out which words have been generated from $\\theta_d$ (and equivalently, which words have been generated from $\\theta_B$) except that it does not completely allocate a word to $\\theta_d$ (or $\\theta_B$), but splits a word in between the two distributions. That is, $p(z=0|\\text{text})$ tells us what percent of the count of \\emph{text} should be allocated to $\\theta_d$, and thus contribute to the estimate of $\\theta_d$.

In each iteration, it would invoke an E-step followed by an M-step, which will be explained in more detail.", "With the E-step and M-step as the basis, the EM algorithm works as follows. First, we initialize all the (unknown) parameters values randomly. This allows us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which further enables us to use Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. This prediction (\\ie, E-step) essentially helps us (probabilistically) separate words generated by the two distributions. Finally, we will collect all the probabilistically allocated counts of words belonging to our topic word distribution and normalize them into probabilities, which serve as an improved estimate of the parameters. The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values.\nA main idea of EM is to leverage such hidden variables to simplify the computation of the ML estimate since knowing the values of these hidden variables makes the ML estimate trivial to compute; we can pool together all the words whose $z$ values are 0 and normalize their counts. Knowing $z$ values can potentially help simplify the task of computing the ML estimate, and EM exploits this fact by alternating the E-step and M-step in each iteration so as to improve the parameter estimate in a hill-climbing manner.\nSpecifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.", "what happens in each iteration of the EM algorithm. First, note that we used superscripts in the formulas of the E-step and M-step to indicate the generation of parameters. Thus the M-step is seen to use the $n$-th generation of parameters together with the newly inferred $z$ values to obtain a new $n+1$-th generation of parameters (\\ie, $p^{n+1}(w|\\theta_d)$). Second, we assume the two component models ($\\theta_d$ and $\\theta_B$) have equal probabilities; we also assume that the background model word distribution is known (fixed as shown in the third column of the table). The computation of EM starts with preparation of relevant word counts. Here we assume that we have just four words, and their counts in the observed text data are shown in the second column of the table. The EM algorithm then initializes all the parameters to be estimated. In our case, we set all the probabilities to $0.25$ in the fourth column of the table. In the first iteration of the EM algorithm, we will apply the E-step to infer which of the two distributions has been used to generate each word, \\ie, to compute $p(z=0|w)$ and $p(z=1|w)$. We only showed $p(z=0|w)$, which is needed in our M-step ($p(z=1|w)=1-p(z=0|w)$). Clearly, $p(z=0|w)$ has different values for different words, and this is because these words have different probabilities in the background model and the initialized $\\theta_d$. Thus, even though the two distributions are equally likely (by our prior) and our initial values for $p(w|\\theta_d)$ form a uniform distribution, the inferred $p(z=0|w)$ would tend to give words with smaller probabilities according to $p(w|\\theta_B)$ a higher probability. For example, $p(z=0|\\text{text}) > p(z=0|\\text{the})$. Once we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words. For example, the count of \\emph{the} is 4, but since $p(z=0|\\text{the})=0.33$, we would obtain a discounted count of \\emph{the}, $4\\cdot 0.33$, when estimating $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ in the M-step. Similarly, the adjusted count for \\emph{text} would be $4\\cdot 0.71$. After the M-step, $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ would be much higher than $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ as shown in the table (shown in the first column under Iteration 2). Those words that are believed to have come from the topic word distribution $\\theta_d$ according to the E-step would have a higher probability. This new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values, leading to a new generation of probabilities for the $z$ values, which can be fed into another M-step to generate yet another generation of potentially improved estimate of $\\theta_d$. In the last row of the table, we show the log-likelihood after each iteration. Since each iteration would lead to a different generation of parameter estimates, it would also give a different value for the log-likelihood function. These log-likelihood values are all negative because the probability is between 0 and 1, which becomes a negative value after the logarithm transformation. We see that after each iteration, the log-likelihood value is increasing, showing that the EM algorithm is iteratively improving the estimated parameter values in a hill-climbing manner. We will provide an intuitive explanation of why it converges to a local maximum later.", "Next, we provide some intuitive explanation why the EM algorithm will converge to a local maximum in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-opt}. Here we show the parameter $\\theta_d$ on the X-axis, and the Y-axis denotes the likelihood function value. This is an over-simplification since $\\theta_d$ is an $M$-dimensional vector, but the one-dimensional view makes it much easier to understand the EM algorithm. We see that in general, the original likelihood function (as a function of $\\theta_d$) may have multiple local maxima. The goal of computing the ML estimate is to find the global maximum, \\ie, the $\\theta_d$ value that makes the likelihood function reach it global maximum. The EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm. It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. You might wonder why we don't work on finding an improved parameter value directly on the original likelihood function. Indeed, it is possible to do that, but in the EM algorithm, the auxiliary function is usually much easier to optimize than the original likelihood function, so in this sense, it reduces the problem into a somewhat simpler one. Although the auxiliary function is generally easier to optimize, it does not always have an analytical solution, which means that the maximization of the auxiliary function may itself require another iterative process, which would be embedded in the overall iterative process of the EM algorithm. In our case of the simple mixture model, we did not explicitly compute this auxiliary function in the E-step because the auxiliary function is very simple and as a result, our M-step has an analytical solution, thus we were able to bypass the explicit computation of this auxiliary function and go directly to find a re-estimate of the parameters. Thus in the E-step, we only computed a key component in the auxiliary function, which is the probability that a word has been generated from each of the two distributions, and our M-step directly gives us an analytical solution to the problem of optimizing the auxiliary function, and the solution directly uses the values obtained from the E-step.", "The EM algorithm would then work as follows. First, it would randomly initialize all the parameters to be estimated. Second, in the E-step, it would attempt to infer the values of the hidden variables based on the current generation of parameters, and obtain a probability distribution of hidden variables over all possible values of these hidden variables. Intuitively, this is to take a good guess of the values of the hidden variables. Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values. This process is repeated until convergence to a local maximum of the likelihood function. Note that although the likelihood function is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum, there is no guarantee that the parameters to be estimated always have a stable convergence to a particular set of values. That is, the parameters may oscillate even though the likelihood is increasing."], "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/4": ["Initialize $\\theta^{(0)}$ randomly or heuristically according to any prior knowledge about where the optimal parameter value might be.\nIteratively improve the estimate of $\\theta$ by alternating between the following two-steps:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The E-step (expectation): Compute $Q(\\theta;\\theta^{(n)})$\n\\item The M-step (maximization): Re-estimate $\\theta$ by maximizing the Q-function:\n$$\\theta^{(n+1)}=argmax_\\theta Q(\\theta;\\theta^{(n)})$$\n\\end{enumerate}"], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["So in all the EM algorithms we introduce a hidden variable to help us solve the problem more easily.\nNow, the idea that we talked about before for predicting the word distribution that has been used when we generate the word is it a predictor, the value of this hidden variable?\nAnd, so, the EM algorithm then, would work as follows.\nFirst, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values.

That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm. As you can see in the last row where we show the log-likelihood, and the likelihood is increasing as we do the iteration. And note that these log-likelihood is negative because the probability is between 0 and 1 when you take a logarithm, it becomes a negative value.", "So here what you see is on the X dimension, we have a c0 value. This is a parameter that we have. On the y axis we see the likelihood function. So this curve is the original likelihood function, and this is the one that we hope to maximize. And we hope to find a c0 value at this point to maximize this. But in the case of Mitsumoto we can not easily find an analytic solution to the problem. So, we have to resolve the numerical errors, and the EM algorithm is such an algorithm. It's a Hill-Climb algorithm. That would mean you start with some random guess. Let's say you start from here, that's your starting point. And then you try to improve this by moving this to another point where you can have a higher likelihood. So that's the ideal hill climbing. And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point. And that's why EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. Now, as you can imagine, when we have many local maxima, we also have to repeat the EM algorithm multiple times. In order to figure out which one is the actual global maximum. And this actually in general is a difficult problem in numeral optimization. So here for example had we started from here, then we gradually just climb up to this top. So, that's not optimal, and we'd like to climb up all the way to here, so the only way to climb up to this gear is to start from somewhere here or here. So, in the EM algorithm, we generally would have to start from different points or have some other way to determine a good initial starting point."], "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/14": ["Clearly, if we find a $\\theta^{(n+1)}$ such that $Q(\\theta^{(n+1)};\\theta^{(n)}) > Q(\\theta^{(n)};\\theta^{(n)})$, then we will also have $L(\\theta^{(n+1)})>L(\\theta^{(n)})$. Thus the general procedure of the EM algorithm is the following: As mentioned earlier, the complete likelihood $L_c(\\theta)$ is much easier to maximize as the values of the hidden variable are assumed to be known. This is why the Q-function, which is an expectation of $L_c(\\theta)$, is often much easier to maximize than the original likelihood function. The major computation to be carried out in the E-step is to compute $p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)})$, which is sometimes very complicated. The M-step involves maximizing the Q-function. Note that we never need to {\\em explicitly} compute the Q-function; instead, we compute the distribution of the hidden variable $z$ and then directly obtain the new parameter values that will maximize the Q-function."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/plsa.jsonl/15": ["What we observed here is actually generally true when using the EM algorithm. That is, the distribution of the hidden variables computed in the E-step can be used to compute the expected counts of an event, which can then aggregated and normalized appropriately to obtain a re-estimate of the parameters. In the implementation of the EM algorithm, we can thus just keep the counts of various events and then normalize them appropriately to obtain re-estimates for various parameters.", "In each iteration, the EM algorithm would first invoke the E-step followed by the M-step. In the E-step, it would augment the data by predicting the hidden variables. In this case, the hidden variable, $z_{d, w}$ indicates whether word $w$ in $d$ is from a ``real'' topic or the background. If it's from a real topic, it determines which of the $k$ topics it is from. From Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-em-comp}, we see that in the E-step we need to compute the probability of $z$ values for every unique word in each document. Thus we can iterate over all the documents, and for each document, iterate over all the unique words in the document to compute the corresponding $p(z_{d,w})$. This computation involves computing the product of the probability of selecting a topic and the probability of word $w$ given by the selected distribution. We can then normalize these products based on the constraints we have, to ensure $\\sum_{j=1}^k p(z_{d,w}=j)=1$. In this case, the normalization is among all the topics. In the M-step, we will also collect the relevant counts and then normalize appropriately to obtain re-estimates of various parameters. We would use the estimated probability distribution $p(z_{d,w})$ to split the count of word $w$ in document $d$ among all the topics. Note that the same word would generally be split in different ways in different documents. Once we split the counts for all the words in this way, we can aggregate the split counts and normalize them. For example, to re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$ (coverage of topic $\\theta_j$ in document $d$), the relevant counts would be the counts of words in $d$ that have been allocated to topic $\\theta_j$, and the normalizer would be the sum of all such counts over all the topics so that after normalization, we would obtain a probability distribution over all the topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, the relevant counts are the sum of all the split counts of word $w$ in all the documents. These aggregated counts would then be normalized by the sum of such aggregated counts over all the words in the vocabulary so that after normalization, we again would obtain a distribution, this time over all the words rather than all the topics."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": ["We can compute this maximum estimate by using the EM algorithm. So in the e step (shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-estep}, we now have to introduce more hidden variables because we have more topics, so our hidden variable z now, which is a topic indicator can take more than two values. So specifically will take a k plus one values, with b in the noting the background. And once locate, to denote other k topics, right. So, now the e step, as you can recall is your augmented data, and by predicting the values of the hidden variable. So we're going to predict for a word, whether the word has come from one of these k plus one distributions. This equation allows us to predict the probability that the word w in document d is generated from topic zero sub j. And the bottom one is the predicted probability that this word has been generated from the background. Note that we use document d here to index the word. Why? Because whether a word is from a particular topic actually depends on the document. Can you see why? Well, it's through the pi's. The pi's are tied to each document. Each document can have potentially different pi's, right. The pi's will then affect our prediction. So, the pi's are here. And this depends on the document. And that might give a different guess for a word in different documents, and that's desirable. In both cases we are using the Baye's Rule, as I explained, basically assessing the likelihood of generating word from each of this division and there's normalize. What about the m step? See Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. Well, we may recall the m step is we take advantage of the inferred z values. To split the counts. And then collected the right counts to re-estimate the parameters. So in this case, we can re-estimate our coverage of probability. And this is re-estimated based on collecting all the words in the document. And that's why we have the count of the word in document. And sum over all the words. And then we're going to look at to what extent this word belongs to the topic theta sub j. And this part is our guess from each step. This tells us how likely this word is actually from theta sub j. And when we multiply them together, we get the discounted count that's located for topic theta sub j. And when we normalize this over all the topics, we get the distribution of all the topics to indicate the coverage. And similarly, the bottom one is the estimated probability of word for a topic. And in this case we are using exact the same count, you can see this is the same discounted account, ] it tells us to what extend we should allocate this word [INAUDIBLE] but then normalization is different. Because in this case we are interested in the word distribution, so we simply normalize this over all the words. This is different, in contrast here we normalize the amount all the topics. It would be useful to take a comparison between the two. This give us different distributions. And these tells us how to improve the parameters. And as I just explained, in both the formula is we have a maximum estimate based on allocated word counts [INAUDIBLE]. Now this phenomena is actually general phenomena in all the EM algorithms. In the m-step, you general with the computer expect an account of the event based on the e-step result,", "So, in our case, we are interested in all of those coverage perimeters, pi's and awarded distributions [INAUDIBLE], and we just randomly normalize them. This is the initialization step and then we will repeat until likelihood converges. Now how do we know whether likelihood converges? We can do compute likelihood at each step and compare the current likelihood with the previous likelihood. If it doesn't change much and we're going to say it stopped, right. So, in each step we're going to do e-step and m-step. In the e-step we're going to do augment the data by predicting the hidden variables. In this case, the hidden variable, z sub d, w, indicates whether the word w in d is from a topic or background. And if it's from a topic, which topic. So if you look at the e-step formulas, essentially we're actually normalizing these counts, sorry, these probabilities of observing the word from each distribution. So you can see, basically the prediction of word from topic zero sub j is based on the probability of selecting that theta sub j as a word distribution to generate the word. Multiply by the probability of observing the word from that distribution. And I said it's proportional to this because in the implementation of EM algorithm you can keep counter for this quantity, and in the end it just normalizes it. So the normalization here is over all the topics and then you would get a probability. Now, in the m-step, we do the same, and we are going to collect these. Allocated account for each topic. And we split words among the topics. And then we're going to normalize them in different ways to obtain the real estimate. So for example, we can normalize among all the topics to get the re-estimate of pi, the coverage. Or we can re-normalize based on all the words. And that would give us a word distribution. So it's useful to think algorithm in this way because when implemented, you can just use variables, but keep track of these quantities in each case. And then you just normalize these variables to make them distribution."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

In each iteration, it would invoke an E-step followed by an M-step, which will be explained in more detail.", "With the E-step and M-step as the basis, the EM algorithm works as follows. First, we initialize all the (unknown) parameters values randomly. This allows us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which further enables us to use Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. This prediction (\\ie, E-step) essentially helps us (probabilistically) separate words generated by the two distributions. Finally, we will collect all the probabilistically allocated counts of words belonging to our topic word distribution and normalize them into probabilities, which serve as an improved estimate of the parameters. The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values.\n\nA main idea of EM is to leverage such hidden variables to simplify the computation of the ML estimate since knowing the values of these hidden variables makes the ML estimate trivial to compute; we can pool together all the words whose $z$ values are 0 and normalize their counts. Knowing $z$ values can potentially help simplify the task of computing the ML estimate, and EM exploits this fact by alternating the E-step and M-step in each iteration so as to improve the parameter estimate in a hill-climbing manner.\nSpecifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.\n\nIn the M-step, we adjust the count $c(w,d)$ based on $p(z=0|w)$ (\\ie, probability that the word $w$ is indeed from $\\theta_d$) so as to obtain a discounted count $c(w,d)p(z=0|w)$ which can be interpreted as the expected count of the event that word $w$ is generated from $\\theta_B$. Similarly, $\\theta_B$ has its own share of the count, which is $c(w,d)p(z=1|w) = c(w,d)[1-p(z=0|w)]$, and we have showing that all the counts of word $w$ have been split between the two distributions.\nThus, the M-step is simply to normalize these discounted counts for all the words to obtain a probability distribution over all the words, which can then be regarded as our improved estimate of $p(w|\\theta_d)$. Note that in the M-step, if $p(z=0|w)=1$ for all words, we would simply compute the simple single unigram language model based on all the observed words (which makes sense since the E-step would have told us that there is no chance that any word has been generated from the background).", "In the first iteration of the EM algorithm, we will apply the E-step to infer which of the two distributions has been used to generate each word, \\ie, to compute $p(z=0|w)$ and $p(z=1|w)$. We only showed $p(z=0|w)$, which is needed in our M-step ($p(z=1|w)=1-p(z=0|w)$). Clearly, $p(z=0|w)$ has different values for different words, and this is because these words have different probabilities in the background model and the initialized $\\theta_d$. Thus, even though the two distributions are equally likely (by our prior) and our initial values for $p(w|\\theta_d)$ form a uniform distribution, the inferred $p(z=0|w)$ would tend to give words with smaller probabilities according to $p(w|\\theta_B)$ a higher probability. For example, $p(z=0|\\text{text}) > p(z=0|\\text{the})$.\nOnce we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words. For example, the count of \\emph{the} is 4, but since $p(z=0|\\text{the})=0.33$, we would obtain a discounted count of \\emph{the}, $4\\cdot 0.33$, when estimating $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ in the M-step. Similarly, the adjusted count for \\emph{text} would be $4\\cdot 0.71$. After the M-step, $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ would be much higher than $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ as shown in the table (shown in the first column under Iteration 2). Those words that are believed to have come from the topic word distribution $\\theta_d$ according to the E-step would have a higher probability. This new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values, leading to a new generation of probabilities for the $z$ values, which can be fed into another M-step to generate yet another generation of potentially improved estimate of $\\theta_d$.\nIn the last row of the table, we show the log-likelihood after each iteration. Since each iteration would lead to a different generation of parameter estimates, it would also give a different value for the log-likelihood function. These log-likelihood values are all negative because the probability is between 0 and 1, which becomes a negative value after the logarithm transformation. We see that after each iteration, the log-likelihood value is increasing, showing that the EM algorithm is iteratively improving the estimated parameter values in a hill-climbing manner.", "The EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm. It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. You might wonder why we don't work on finding an improved parameter value directly on the original likelihood function. Indeed, it is possible to do that, but in the EM algorithm, the auxiliary function is usually much easier to optimize than the original likelihood function, so in this sense, it reduces the problem into a somewhat simpler one. Although the auxiliary function is generally easier to optimize, it does not always have an analytical solution, which means that the maximization of the auxiliary function may itself require another iterative process, which would be embedded in the overall iterative process of the EM algorithm.", "First, it would randomly initialize all the parameters to be estimated. Second, in the E-step, it would attempt to infer the values of the hidden variables based on the current generation of parameters, and obtain a probability distribution of hidden variables over all possible values of these hidden variables.

So what are the relevance of the statistics? Well these are the word counts. So assume we have just four words, and their counts are like this. And this is our background model that assigns high probabilities to common words like the. And in the first iteration, you can picture what will happen. Well first we initialize all the values. So here, this probability that we're interested in is normalized into a uniform distribution of all the words. And then the E-step would give us a guess of the distribution that has been used. That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm. As you can see in the last row where we show the log-likelihood, and the likelihood is increasing as we do the iteration. And note that these log-likelihood is negative because the probability is between 0 and 1 when you take a logarithm, it becomes a negative value.", "And we hope to find a c0 value at this point to maximize this. But in the case of Mitsumoto we can not easily find an analytic solution to the problem. So, we have to resolve the numerical errors, and the EM algorithm is such an algorithm. It's a Hill-Climb algorithm. That would mean you start with some random guess. Let's say you start from here, that's your starting point. And then you try to improve this by moving this to another point where you can have a higher likelihood. So that's the ideal hill climbing. And in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point. And that's why EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum."], "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/14": ["Clearly, if we find a $\\theta^{(n+1)}$ such that\n$Q(\\theta^{(n+1)};\\theta^{(n)}) > Q(\\theta^{(n)};\\theta^{(n)})$, then we will\nalso have $L(\\theta^{(n+1)})>L(\\theta^{(n)})$. Thus the general procedure of the\nEM algorithm is the following\n\\item Stop when the likelihood $L(\\theta)$ converges.\n\\end{enumerate}\nAs mentioned earlier, the complete likelihood $L_c(\\theta)$ is much easier to\nmaximize as the values of the hidden variable are assumed to be known. This is\nwhy the Q-function, which is an expectation of $L_c(\\theta)$, is often much\neasier to maximize than the original likelihood function. In cases when there\ndoes not exist a natural latent variable, we often introduce a hidden variable\nso that the complete likelihood function is easy to maximize.\nThe major computation to be carried out in the E-step is to compute\n$p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)})$, which is sometimes very complicated.

That is, the distribution of the hidden variables computed in the E-step can be used to compute the expected counts of an event, which can then aggregated and normalized appropriately to obtain a re-estimate of the parameters. In the implementation of the EM algorithm, we can thus just keep the counts of various events and then normalize them appropriately to obtain re-estimates for various parameters.\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-em-comp}, we show the computation of the EM algorithm for PLSA in more detail. We first initialize all the unknown parameters randomly, including the coverage distribution $\\pi_{d,j}$ for each document $d$, and the word distribution for each topic $p(w|\\theta_j)$. After the initialization step, the EM algorithm would go through a loop until the likelihood converges.", "In each iteration, the EM algorithm would first invoke the E-step followed by the M-step. In the E-step, it would augment the data by predicting the hidden variables. In this case, the hidden variable, $z_{d, w}$ indicates whether word $w$ in $d$ is from a ``real'' topic or the background. If it's from a real topic, it determines which of the $k$ topics it is from. From Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-em-comp}, we see that in the E-step we need to compute the probability of $z$ values for every unique word in each document. Thus we can iterate over all the documents, and for each document, iterate over all the unique words in the document to compute the corresponding $p(z_{d,w})$. This computation involves computing the product of the probability of selecting a topic and the probability of word $w$ given by the selected distribution. We can then normalize these products based on the constraints we have, to ensure $\\sum_{j=1}^k p(z_{d,w}=j)=1$. In this case, the normalization is among all the topics. In the M-step, we will also collect the relevant counts and then normalize appropriately to obtain re-estimates of various parameters. We would use the estimated probability distribution $p(z_{d,w})$ to split the count of word $w$ in document $d$ among all the topics. Note that the same word would generally be split in different ways in different documents. Once we split the counts for all the words in this way, we can aggregate the split counts and normalize them. For example, to re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$ (coverage of topic $\\theta_j$ in document $d$), the relevant counts would be the counts of words in $d$ that have been allocated to topic $\\theta_j$, and the normalizer would be the sum of all such counts over all the topics so that after normalization, we would obtain a probability distribution over all the topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, the relevant counts are the sum of all the split counts of word $w$ in all the documents. These aggregated counts would then be normalized by the sum of such aggregated counts over all the words in the vocabulary so that after normalization, we again would obtain a distribution, this time over all the words rather than all the topics."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": ["We can compute this maximum estimate by using the EM algorithm.\nSo in the e step (shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-estep},\nwe now have to introduce more hidden\nvariables because we have more topics,\nso our hidden variable z now,\nwhich is a topic indicator can\ntake more than two values.\nSo specifically will\ntake a k plus one values,\nwith b in the noting the background.\nAnd once locate,\nto denote other k topics, right.\nSo, now the e step, as you can\nrecall is your augmented data, and\nby predicting the values\nof the hidden variable.\nSo we're going to predict for\na word, whether the word has come from\none of these k plus one distributions.\nThis equation allows us to\npredict the probability\nthat the word w in document d is\ngenerated from topic zero sub j.\nAnd the bottom one is\nthe predicted probability that this\nword has been generated\nfrom the background.\nNote that we use document\nd here to index the word.\nWhy?\nBecause whether a word is\nfrom a particular topic\nactually depends on the document.\nCan you see why?\nWell, it's through the pi's.\nThe pi's are tied to each document.\nEach document can have potentially\ndifferent pi's, right.\nThe pi's will then affect our prediction.\nSo, the pi's are here.\nAnd this depends on the document.\nAnd that might give a different guess for\na word in different documents,\nand that's desirable.\nIn both cases we are using\nthe Baye's Rule, as I explained, basically\nassessing the likelihood of generating\nword from each of this division and\nthere's normalize.\nWhat about the m step?

So, in our case, we are interested in all of those coverage perimeters, pi's and awarded distributions [INAUDIBLE], and we just randomly normalize them. This is the initialization step and then we will repeat until likelihood converges. Now how do we know whether likelihood converges? We can do compute likelihood at each step and compare the current likelihood with the previous likelihood. If it doesn't change much and we're going to say it stopped, right. So, in each step we're going to do e-step and m-step. In the e-step we're going to do augment the data by predicting the hidden variables. In this case, the hidden variable, z sub d, w, indicates whether the word w in d is from a topic or background. And if it's from a topic, which topic. So if you look at the e-step formulas, essentially we're actually normalizing these counts, sorry, these probabilities of observing the word from each distribution. So you can see, basically the prediction of word from topic zero sub j is based on the probability of selecting that theta sub j as a word distribution to generate the word. Multiply by the probability of observing the word from that distribution. And I said it's proportional to this because in the implementation of EM algorithm you can keep counter for this quantity, and in the end it just normalizes it. So the normalization here is over all the topics and then you would get a probability. Now, in the m-step, we do the same, and we are going to collect these. Allocated account for each topic. And we split words among the topics. And then we're going to normalize them in different ways to obtain the real estimate. So for example, we can normalize among all the topics to get the re-estimate of pi, the coverage. Or we can re-normalize based on all the words. And that would give us a word distribution. So it's useful to think algorithm in this way because when implemented, you can just use variables, but keep track of these quantities in each case. And then you just normalize these variables to make them distribution."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-470752": 3, "wikipedia-31745436": 1, "wikipedia-41853858": 1, "wikipedia-13784890": 1, "wikipedia-11945602": 1, "wikipedia-1208480": 1, "wikipedia-1089270": 1, "wikipedia-40374554": 1, "wikipedia-871681": 3, "wikipedia-1007969": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/13": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/4": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/14": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/12": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/plsa.jsonl/15": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/clustering/document.jsonl/10": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/background/prob-stats.jsonl/20": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": 2}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-470752": 3, "wikipedia-31745436": 1, "wikipedia-41853858": 1, "wikipedia-13784890": 1, "wikipedia-11945602": 1, "wikipedia-1208480": 1, "wikipedia-1089270": 1, "wikipedia-40374554": 1, "wikipedia-871681": 3, "wikipedia-1007969": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/13": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/4": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/14": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/12": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/plsa.jsonl/15": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/clustering/document.jsonl/10": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/background/prob-stats.jsonl/20": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": 3}}}

Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values.\nA main idea of EM is to leverage such hidden variables to simplify the computation of the ML estimate since knowing the values of these hidden variables makes the ML estimate trivial to compute; we can pool together all the words whose $z$ values are 0 and normalize their counts. Knowing $z$ values can potentially help simplify the task of computing the ML estimate, and EM exploits this fact by alternating the E-step and M-step in each iteration so as to improve the parameter estimate in a hill-climbing manner.\nSpecifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.", "This new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values, leading to a new generation of probabilities for the $z$ values, which can be fed into another M-step to generate yet another generation of potentially improved estimate of $\\theta_d$.\nIn the last row of the table, we show the log-likelihood after each iteration.

Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$.

In cases when there\ndoes not exist a natural latent variable, we often introduce a hidden variable\nso that the complete likelihood function is easy to maximize.\nThe major computation to be carried out in the E-step is to compute\n$p(H|X,\\theta^{(n)})$, which is sometimes very complicated.

Intuitively, we use the inferred distribution of $z$ values from the E-step to split the counts of $w$ among all the distributions. The amount of split counts of $w$ that $\\theta_j$ can get is determined based on the inferred likelihood that $w$ is generated by topic $\\theta_j$.

To re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$, the probability that document $d$ covers topic $\\theta_j$, we would simply collect all the split counts of words in document $d$ that belong to each $\\theta_j$, and then normalize these counts among all the $k$ topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, we would collect the split counts of a word toward $\\theta_j$ from all the documents in the collection, and then normalize these counts among all the words. Note that the normalizers are very different in these two cases, which are directly related to the constraints we have on these parameters. In the case of re-estimation of $\\pi$, the constraint is that the $\\pi$ values must sum to one for each document, thus our normalizer has been chosen to ensure that the re-estimated values of $\\pi$ indeed sum to one for each document. The same is true for the re-estimation of $p(w|\\theta)$, where our normalizer allows us to obtain a word distribution for each topic. What we observed here is actually generally true when using the EM algorithm. That is, the distribution of the hidden variables computed in the E-step can be used to compute the expected counts of an event, which can then aggregated and normalized appropriately to obtain a re-estimate of the parameters.", "In the M-step, we will also collect the relevant counts and then normalize appropriately to obtain re-estimates of various parameters.

Once we split the counts for all the words in this way, we can aggregate the split counts and normalize them. For example, to re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$ (coverage of topic $\theta_j$ in document $d$), the relevant counts would be the counts of words in $d$ that have been allocated to topic $\theta_j$, and the normalizer would be the sum of all such counts over all the topics so that after normalization, we would obtain a probability distribution over all the topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, the relevant counts are the sum of all the split counts of word $w$ in all the documents.

The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values. Specifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation. In the M-step, we adjust the count $c(w,d)$ based on $p(z=0|w)$ (\\ie, probability that the word $w$ is indeed from $\\theta_d$) so as to obtain a discounted count $c(w,d)p(z=0|w)$ which can be interpreted as the expected count of the event that word $w$ is generated from $\\theta_B$. Similarly, $\\theta_B$ has its own share of the count, which is $c(w,d)p(z=1|w) = c(w,d)[1-p(z=0|w)]$, and we have showing that all the counts of word $w$ have been split between the two distributions. Thus, the M-step is simply to normalize these discounted counts for all the words to obtain a probability distribution over all the words, which can then be regarded as our improved estimate of $p(w|\\theta_d)$. Note that in the M-step, if $p(z=0|w)=1$ for all words, we would simply compute the simple single unigram language model based on all the observed words (which makes sense since the E-step would have told us that there is no chance that any word has been generated from the background).", "Once we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words. For example, the count of \\emph{the} is 4, but since $p(z=0|\\text{the})=0.33$, we would obtain a discounted count of \\emph{the}, $4\\cdot 0.33$, when estimating $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ in the M-step. Similarly, the adjusted count for \\emph{text} would be $4\\cdot 0.71$. After the M-step, $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ would be much higher than $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ as shown in the table (shown in the first column under Iteration 2). Those words that are believed to have come from the topic word distribution $\\theta_d$ according to the E-step would have a higher probability. This new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values, leading to a new generation of probabilities for the $z$ values, which can be fed into another M-step to generate yet another generation of potentially improved estimate of $\\theta_d$.", "In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function.", "Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values."], "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/14": ["The M-step involves maximizing the Q-function.

So you can see, basically the prediction of word from topic zero sub j is based on the probability of selecting that theta sub j as a word distribution to generate the word. Multiply by the probability of observing the word from that distribution.

Intuitively, we use the inferred distribution of $z$ values from the E-step to split the counts of $w$ among all the distributions. The amount of split counts of $w$ that $\\theta_j$ can get is determined based on the inferred likelihood that $w$ is generated by topic $\\theta_j$.\nOnce we have such a split count of each word for each distribution, we can easily pool together these split counts to re-estimate both $\\pi$ and $p(w|\\theta)$ as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}.

Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, we would collect the split counts of a word toward $\\theta_j$ from all the documents in the collection, and then normalize these counts among all the words. Note that the normalizers are very different in these two cases, which are directly related to the constraints we have on these parameters. In the case of re-estimation of $\\pi$, the constraint is that the $\\pi$ values must sum to one for each document, thus our normalizer has been chosen to ensure that the re-estimated values of $\\pi$ indeed sum to one for each document. The same is true for the re-estimation of $p(w|\\theta)$, where our normalizer allows us to obtain a word distribution for each topic.\nWhat we observed here is actually generally true when using the EM algorithm.

In each iteration, it would invoke an E-step followed by an M-step, which will be explained in more detail.", "With the E-step and M-step as the basis, the EM algorithm works as follows. First, we initialize all the (unknown) parameters values randomly. This allows us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which further enables us to use Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. This prediction (\\ie, E-step) essentially helps us (probabilistically) separate words generated by the two distributions. Finally, we will collect all the probabilistically allocated counts of words belonging to our topic word distribution and normalize them into probabilities, which serve as an improved estimate of the parameters. The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values. A main idea of EM is to leverage such hidden variables to simplify the computation of the ML estimate since knowing the values of these hidden variables makes the ML estimate trivial to compute; we can pool together all the words whose $z$ values are 0 and normalize their counts. Knowing $z$ values can potentially help simplify the task of computing the ML estimate, and EM exploits this fact by alternating the E-step and M-step in each iteration so as to improve the parameter estimate in a hill-climbing manner. Specifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.", "Thus the M-step is seen to use the $n$-th generation of parameters together with the newly inferred $z$ values to obtain a new $n+1$-th generation of parameters (\\ie, $p^{n+1}(w|\\theta_d)$).\nThis new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values, leading to a new generation of probabilities for the $z$ values, which can be fed into another M-step to generate yet another generation of potentially improved estimate of $\\theta_d$.\nIn the last row of the table, we show the log-likelihood after each iteration. Since each iteration would lead to a different generation of parameter estimates, it would also give a different value for the log-likelihood function.\nWe see that after each iteration, the log-likelihood value is increasing, showing that the EM algorithm is iteratively improving the estimated parameter values in a hill-climbing manner.", "Next, we provide some intuitive explanation why the EM algorithm will converge to a local maximum in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-opt}. Here we show the parameter $\\theta_d$ on the X-axis, and the Y-axis denotes the likelihood function value. This is an over-simplification since $\\theta_d$ is an $M$-dimensional vector, but the one-dimensional view makes it much easier to understand the EM algorithm. We see that in general, the original likelihood function (as a function of $\\theta_d$) may have multiple local maxima. The goal of computing the ML estimate is to find the global maximum, \\ie, the $\\theta_d$ value that makes the likelihood function reach it global maximum. The EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm. It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. You might wonder why we don't work on finding an improved parameter value directly on the original likelihood function. Indeed, it is possible to do that, but in the EM algorithm, the auxiliary function is usually much easier to optimize than the original likelihood function, so in this sense, it reduces the problem into a somewhat simpler one. Although the auxiliary function is generally easier to optimize, it does not always have an analytical solution, which means that the maximization of the auxiliary function may itself require another iterative process, which would be embedded in the overall iterative process of the EM algorithm. In our case of the simple mixture model, we did not explicitly compute this auxiliary function in the E-step because the auxiliary function is very simple and as a result, our M-step has an analytical solution, thus we were able to bypass the explicit computation of this auxiliary function and go directly to find a re-estimate of the parameters. Thus in the E-step, we only computed a key component in the auxiliary function, which is the probability that a word has been generated from each of the two distributions, and our M-step directly gives us an analytical solution to the problem of optimizing the auxiliary function, and the solution directly uses the values obtained from the E-step.", "In general, when we apply the EM algorithm, we would augment our data with supplementary unobserved hidden variables to simplify the estimation problem. The EM algorithm would then work as follows. First, it would randomly initialize all the parameters to be estimated. Second, in the E-step, it would attempt to infer the values of the hidden variables based on the current generation of parameters, and obtain a probability distribution of hidden variables over all possible values of these hidden variables. Intuitively, this is to take a good guess of the values of the hidden variables. Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values. This process is repeated until convergence to a local maximum of the likelihood function. Note that although the likelihood function is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum, there is no guarantee that the parameters to be estimated always have a stable convergence to a particular set of values. That is, the parameters may oscillate even though the likelihood is increasing. Only if some conditions are satisfied, would the parameters be guaranteed to converge (see \\cite{em-converge})."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in. Okay, so, as I said, the bridge between the two is really the variable z, hidden variable, which indicates how likely this water is from the top water distribution, theta sub p. So, this slide has a lot of content and you may need to. Pause the reader to digest it. But this basically captures the essence of EM Algorithm. Start with initial values that are often random themself. And then we invoke E-step followed by M-step to get an improved setting of parameters. And then we repeated this, so this a Hill-Climbing algorithm that would gradually improve the estimate of parameters. As I will explain later there is some guarantee.", "So, in the EM algorithm, the way we achieve this is to do two things. First, we'll fix a lower bound of likelihood function. So this is the lower bound. See here. And once we fit the lower bound, we can then maximize the lower bound. And of course, the reason why this works, is because the lower bound is much easier to optimize. So we know our current guess is here. And by maximizing the lower bound, we'll move this point to the top. To here. Right? And we can then map to the original likelihood function, we find this point. Because it's a lower bound, we are guaranteed to improve this guess, right? Because we improve our lower bound and then the original likelihood curve which is above this lower bound will definitely be improved as well. So we already know it's improving the lower bound. So we definitely improve this original likelihood function, which is above this lower bound. So, in our example, the current guess is parameter value given by the current generation. And then the next guess is the re-estimated parameter values. From this illustration you can see the next guess is always better than the current guess. Unless it has reached the maximum, where it will be stuck there. So the two would be equal. So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point. And that's why EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/plsa.jsonl/15": ["In each iteration, the EM algorithm would first invoke the E-step followed by the M-step. In the E-step, it would augment the data by predicting the hidden variables. In this case, the hidden variable, $z_{d, w}$ indicates whether word $w$ in $d$ is from a ``real'' topic or the background. If it's from a real topic, it determines which of the $k$ topics it is from. From Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-em-comp}, we see that in the E-step we need to compute the probability of $z$ values for every unique word in each document. Thus we can iterate over all the documents, and for each document, iterate over all the unique words in the document to compute the corresponding $p(z_{d,w})$. This computation involves computing the product of the probability of selecting a topic and the probability of word $w$ given by the selected distribution. We can then normalize these products based on the constraints we have, to ensure $\\sum_{j=1}^k p(z_{d,w}=j)=1$. In this case, the normalization is among all the topics. In the M-step, we will also collect the relevant counts and then normalize appropriately to obtain re-estimates of various parameters.

The alternation between these steps monotonically increases the likelihood, guaranteeing convergence to a local optimum under mild conditions. Textbooks often provide proofs or intuitive explanations for this behavior.", "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": ["With the E-step and M-step as the basis, the EM algorithm works as follows. First, we initialize all the (unknown) parameters values randomly. This allows us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which further enables us to use Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. This prediction (\\ie, E-step) essentially helps us (probabilistically) separate words generated by the two distributions. Finally, we will collect all the probabilistically allocated counts of words belonging to our topic word distribution and normalize them into probabilities, which serve as an improved estimate of the parameters. The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values.\n\nSpecifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.", "In the first iteration of the EM algorithm, we will apply the E-step to infer which of the two distributions has been used to generate each word, \\ie, to compute $p(z=0|w)$ and $p(z=1|w)$. We only showed $p(z=0|w)$, which is needed in our M-step ($p(z=1|w)=1-p(z=0|w)$). Clearly, $p(z=0|w)$ has different values for different words, and this is because these words have different probabilities in the background model and the initialized $\\theta_d$. Thus, even though the two distributions are equally likely (by our prior) and our initial values for $p(w|\\theta_d)$ form a uniform distribution, the inferred $p(z=0|w)$ would tend to give words with smaller probabilities according to $p(w|\\theta_B)$ a higher probability. For example, $p(z=0|\\text{text}) > p(z=0|\\text{the})$.\nOnce we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words. For example, the count of \\emph{the} is 4, but since $p(z=0|\\text{the})=0.33$, we would obtain a discounted count of \\emph{the}, $4\\cdot 0.33$, when estimating $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ in the M-step. Similarly, the adjusted count for \\emph{text} would be $4\\cdot 0.71$. After the M-step, $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ would be much higher than $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ as shown in the table (shown in the first column under Iteration 2). Those words that are believed to have come from the topic word distribution $\\theta_d$ according to the E-step would have a higher probability. This new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values, leading to a new generation of probabilities for the $z$ values, which can be fed into another M-step to generate yet another generation of potentially improved estimate of $\\theta_d$.\nIn the last row of the table, we show the log-likelihood after each iteration. Since each iteration would lead to a different generation of parameter estimates, it would also give a different value for the log-likelihood function. These log-likelihood values are all negative because the probability is between 0 and 1, which becomes a negative value after the logarithm transformation. We see that after each iteration, the log-likelihood value is increasing, showing that the EM algorithm is iteratively improving the estimated parameter values in a hill-climbing manner. We will provide an intuitive explanation of why it converges to a local maximum later.", "The EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm. It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum.", "Second, in the E-step, it would attempt to infer the values of the hidden variables based on the current generation of parameters, and obtain a probability distribution of hidden variables over all possible values of these hidden variables. Intuitively, this is to take a good guess of the values of the hidden variables. Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values. This process is repeated until convergence to a local maximum of the likelihood function. Note that although the likelihood function is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum, there is no guarantee that the parameters to be estimated always have a stable convergence to a particular set of values. That is, the parameters may oscillate even though the likelihood is increasing. Only if some conditions are satisfied, would the parameters be guaranteed to converge (see \\cite{em-converge})."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["Now, the idea that we talked about before for predicting the word distribution that has been used when we generate the word is it a predictor, the value of this hidden variable? And, so, the EM algorithm then, would work as follows. First, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values. In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in. Okay, so, as I said, the bridge between the two is really the variable z, hidden variable, which indicates how likely this water is from the top water distribution, theta sub p. So, this slide has a lot of content and you may need to. Pause the reader to digest it. But this basically captures the essence of EM Algorithm. Start with initial values that are often random themself. And then we invoke E-step followed by M-step to get an improved setting of parameters. And then we repeated this, so this a Hill-Climbing algorithm that would gradually improve the estimate of parameters. As I will explain later there is some guarantee", "So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point.

This is in contrast to a global optimum, which is the optimal solution among all possible solutions, not just those in a particular neighborhood of values. \n\nIf the problem to be solved has all locally optimal points with the same value of the function to be optimized, local search effectively solves the global problem: finding a local optimum delivers a globally optimal solution.\n\nThe locality of the optimum is dependent on the neighborhood structure as defined by the local search method that is used for optimizing the function.\nIn many cases, local optima deliver sub-optimal solutions to the global problem, and a local search method needs to be modified to continue the search beyond local optimality; see for example iterated local search, tabu search, reactive search optimization, and simulated annealing."], "wikipedia-470752": ["The EM algorithm is used to find (local) maximum likelihood parameters of a statistical model in cases where the equations cannot be solved directly. Typically these models involve latent variables in addition to unknown parameters and known data observations. That is, either missing values exist among the data, or the model can be formulated more simply by assuming the existence of further unobserved data points. For example, a mixture model can be described more simply by assuming that each observed data point has a corresponding unobserved data point, or latent variable, specifying the mixture component to which each data point belongs.\n\nAlthough an EM iteration does increase the observed data (i.e., marginal) likelihood function, no guarantee exists that the sequence converges to a maximum likelihood estimator. For multimodal distributions, this means that an EM algorithm may converge to a local maximum of the observed data likelihood function, depending on starting values. A variety of heuristic or metaheuristic approaches exist to escape a local maximum, such as random-restart hill climbing (starting with several different random initial estimates \"\u03b8\"), or applying simulated annealing methods.", "EM typically converges to a local optimum, not necessarily the global optimum, with no bound on the convergence rate in general.

It would define a local maximum as a point where the objective function (e.g., likelihood) is higher than all nearby points but not necessarily the global highest point. In the EM algorithm, getting stuck in a local maximum is a key limitation because it can prevent the algorithm from finding the optimal solution, emphasizing the need for good initialization or techniques like multiple restarts.", "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["And that's why EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. Now, as you can imagine, when we have many local maxima, we also have to repeat the EM algorithm multiple times. In order to figure out which one is the actual global maximum. And this actually in general is a difficult problem in numeral optimization. So here for example had we started from here, then we gradually just climb up to this top. So, that's not optimal, and we'd like to climb up all the way to here, so the only way to climb up to this gear is to start from somewhere here or here. So, in the EM algorithm, we generally would have to start from different points or have some other way to determine a good initial starting point. To summarize in this lecture we introduced the EM algorithm. This is a general algorithm for computing maximum maximum likelihood estimate of all kinds of models, so not just for our simple model. And it's a hill-climbing algorithm, so it can only converge to a local maximum and it will depend on initial points."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": ["The main idea of the EM algorithm is to guess (infer) which word is from which distribution based on a tentative estimate of parameters, and then use the inferred partitioning of words to improve the estimate of parameters, which, in turn, enables improved inference of the partitioning, leading to an iterative hill-climbing algorithm to improve the estimate of the parameters until hitting a local maximum.", "The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values.", "Next, we provide some intuitive explanation why the EM algorithm will converge to a local maximum in Figure~\\ref{fig:em-opt}. Here we show the parameter $\\theta_d$ on the X-axis, and the Y-axis denotes the likelihood function value. This is an over-simplification since $\\theta_d$ is an $M$-dimensional vector, but the one-dimensional view makes it much easier to understand the EM algorithm. We see that in general, the original likelihood function (as a function of $\\theta_d$) may have multiple local maxima. The goal of computing the ML estimate is to find the global maximum, \\ie, the $\\theta_d$ value that makes the likelihood function reach it global maximum. The EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm. It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum.", "This process is repeated until convergence to a local maximum of the likelihood function. Note that although the likelihood function is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum, there is no guarantee that the parameters to be estimated always have a stable convergence to a particular set of values.

And, so, the EM algorithm then, would work as follows. First, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values. In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter.", "Now here data augmentation\nis done probabilistically.\nThat means,\nwe're not going to just say exactly\nwhat's the value of a hidden variable.\nBut we're going to have a probability\ndistribution over the possible values of\nthese hidden variables.\nSo this causes a split of counts\nof events probabilistically.\nAnd in our case we'll split the word\ncounts between the two distributions."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/plsa.jsonl/15": ["The M-step is also similar to that in the simple mixture model. We show the equations in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. We see that a key component in the two equations, for re-estimating $\\pi$ and $p(w|\\theta)$ respectively, is $c(w,d)(1-p(z_{d,w}=B)p(z_{d,w}=j)$, which can be interpreted as the allocated counts of $w$ to topic $\\theta_j$. Intuitively, we use the inferred distribution of $z$ values from the E-step to split the counts of $w$ among all the distributions. The amount of split counts of $w$ that $\\theta_j$ can get is determined based on the inferred likelihood that $w$ is generated by topic $\\theta_j$.\nOnce we have such a split count of each word for each distribution, we can easily pool together these split counts to re-estimate both $\\pi$ and $p(w|\\theta)$ as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. To re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$, the probability that document $d$ covers topic $\\theta_j$, we would simply collect all the split counts of words in document $d$ that belong to each $\\theta_j$, and then normalize these counts among all the $k$ topics.

We would use the estimated probability distribution $p(z_{d,w})$ to split the count of word $w$ in document $d$ among all the topics. Note that the same word would generally be split in different ways in different documents. Once we split the counts for all the words in this way, we can aggregate the split counts and normalize them. For example, to re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$ (coverage of topic $\\theta_j$ in document $d$), the relevant counts would be the counts of words in $d$ that have been allocated to topic $\\theta_j$, and the normalizer would be the sum of all such counts over all the topics so that after normalization, we would obtain a probability distribution over all the topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, the relevant counts are the sum of all the split counts of word $w$ in all the documents.

This way, we", "This step of re-estimating parameters based on the results from the E-step is called the M-step.\nFirst, we initialize all the (unknown) parameters values randomly. This allows us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which further enables us to use Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. This prediction (\\ie, E-step) essentially helps us (probabilistically) separate words generated by the two distributions. Finally, we will collect all the probabilistically allocated counts of words belonging to our topic word distribution and normalize them into probabilities, which serve as an improved estimate of the parameters.\nSpecifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.\nIn the M-step, we adjust the count $c(w,d)$ based on $p(z=0|w)$ (\\ie, probability that the word $w$ is indeed from $\\theta_d$) so as to obtain a discounted count $c(w,d)p(z=0|w)$ which can be interpreted as the expected count of the event that word $w$ is generated from $\\theta_B$. Similarly, $\\theta_B$ has its own share of the count, which is $c(w,d)p(z=1|w) = c(w,d)[1-p(z=0|w)], showing that all the counts of word $w$ have been split between the two distributions.\nThus, the M-step is simply to normalize these discounted counts for all the words to obtain a probability distribution over all the words, which can then be regarded as our improved estimate of $p(w|\\theta_d).", "In the first iteration of the EM algorithm, we will apply the E-step to infer which of the two distributions has been used to generate each word, \\ie, to compute $p(z=0|w)$ and $p(z=1|w)$. We only showed $p(z=0|w)$, which is needed in our M-step ($p(z=1|w)=1-p(z=0|w)$). Clearly, $p(z=0|w)$ has different values for different words, and this is because these words have different probabilities in the background model and the initialized $\theta_d$. Thus, even though the two distributions are equally likely (by our prior) and our initial values for $p(w|\theta_d)$ form a uniform distribution, the inferred $p(z=0|w)$ would tend to give words with smaller probabilities according to $p(w|\theta_B)$ a higher probability. For example, $p(z=0|\text{text}) > p(z=0|\text{the})$.\nOnce we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the M-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the corresponding words. For example, the count of \\emph{the} is 4, but since $p(z=0|\text{the})=0.33$, we would obtain a discounted count of \\emph{the}, $4\\cdot 0.33$, when estimating $p(\text{the}|\theta_d)$ in the M-step. Similarly, the adjusted count for \\emph{text} would be $4\\cdot 0.71$. After the M-step, $p(\text{text}|\theta_d)$ would be much higher than $p(\text{the}|\theta_d)$ as shown in the table (shown in the first column under Iteration 2).

In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function.", "Second, in the E-step, it would attempt to infer the values of the hidden variables based on the current generation of parameters, and obtain a probability distribution of hidden variables over all possible values of these hidden variables.

The M-step is also similar to that in the simple mixture model. We show the equations in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. We see that a key component in the two equations, for re-estimating \u03c0 and p(w|\u03b8) respectively, is c(w,d)(1-p(z_{d,w}=B)p(z_{d,w}=j), which can be interpreted as the allocated counts of w to topic \u03b8_j. Intuitively, we use the inferred distribution of z values from the E-step to split the counts of w among all the distributions. The amount of split counts of w that \u03b8_j can get is determined based on the inferred likelihood that w is generated by topic \u03b8_j. Once we have such a split count of each word for each distribution, we can easily pool together these split counts to re-estimate both \u03c0 and p(w|\u03b8) as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. To re-estimate \u03c0_{d,j}, the probability that document d covers topic \u03b8_j, we would simply collect all the split counts of words in document d that belong to each \u03b8_j, and then normalize these counts among all the k topics. Similarly, to re-estimate p(w|\u03b8_j), we would collect the split counts of a word toward \u03b8_j from all the documents in the collection, and then normalize these counts among all the words. Note that the normalizers are very different in these two cases, which are directly related to the constraints we have on these parameters.", "In each iteration, the EM algorithm would first invoke the E-step followed by the M-step. In the E-step, it would augment the data by predicting the hidden variables. In this case, the hidden variable, $z_{d, w}$ indicates whether word $w$ in $d$ is from a ``real'' topic or the background. If it's from a real topic, it determines which of the $k$ topics it is from. From Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-em-comp}, we see that in the E-step we need to compute the probability of $z$ values for every unique word in each document. Thus we can iterate over all the documents, and for each document, iterate over all the unique words in the document to compute the corresponding $p(z_{d,w})$. This computation involves computing the product of the probability of selecting a topic and the probability of word $w$ given by the selected distribution. We can then normalize these products based on the constraints we have, to ensure $\\sum_{j=1}^k p(z_{d,w}=j)=1$. In this case, the normalization is among all the topics. In the M-step, we will also collect the relevant counts and then normalize appropriately to obtain re-estimates of various parameters. We would use the estimated probability distribution $p(z_{d,w})$ to split the count of word $w$ in document $d$ among all the topics. Note that the same word would generally be split in different ways in different documents. Once we split the counts for all the words in this way, we can aggregate the split counts and normalize them. For example, to re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$ (coverage of topic $\\theta_j$ in document $d$), the relevant counts would be the counts of words in $d$ that have been allocated to topic $\\theta_j$, and the normalizer would be the sum of all such counts over all the topics so that after normalization, we would obtain a probability distribution over all the topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, the relevant counts are the sum of all the split counts of word $w$ in all the documents. These aggregated counts would then be normalized by the sum of such aggregated counts over all the words in the vocabulary so that after normalization, we again would obtain a distribution, this time over all the words rather than all the topics."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["First, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values. In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So let me also illustrate that we can group the words that are believed to have come from zero sub d, and that's text, mining algorithm, for example, and clustering. And we group them together to help us re-estimate the parameters that we're interested in. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in.", "And then the E-step would give us a guess of the distribution that has been used. That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate.", "So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound.

So in the e step (shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-estep}, we now have to introduce more hidden variables because we have more topics, so our hidden variable z now, which is a topic indicator can take more than two values. So specifically will take a k plus one values, with b in the noting the background. And once locate, to denote other k topics, right. So, now the e step, as you can recall is your augmented data, and by predicting the values of the hidden variable. So we're going to predict for a word, whether the word has come from one of these k plus one distributions. This equation allows us to predict the probability that the word w in document d is generated from topic zero sub j. And the bottom one is the predicted probability that this word has been generated from the background. Note that we use document d here to index the word. Why? Because whether a word is from a particular topic actually depends on the document. Can you see why? Well, it's through the pi's. The pi's are tied to each document. Each document can have potentially different pi's, right. The pi's will then affect our prediction. So, the pi's are here. And this depends on the document. And that might give a different guess for a word in different documents, and that's desirable. In both cases we are using the Baye's Rule, as I explained, basically assessing the likelihood of generating word from each of this division and there's normalize. What about the m step? See Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. Well, we may recall the m step is we take advantage of the inferred z values. To split the counts. And then collected the right counts to re-estimate the parameters. So in this case, we can re-estimate our coverage of probability. And this is re-estimated based on collecting all the words in the document. And that's why we have the count of the word in document. And sum over all the words. And then we're going to look at to what extent this word belongs to the topic theta sub j. And this part is our guess from each step. This tells us how likely this word is actually from theta sub j. And when we multiply them together, we get the discounted count that's located for topic theta sub j. And when we normalize this over all the topics, we get the distribution of all the topics to indicate the coverage. And similarly, the bottom one is the estimated probability of word for a topic. And in this case we are using exact the same count, you can see this is the same discounted account,] it tells us to what extend we should allocate this word [INAUDIBLE] but then normalization is different. Because in this case we are interested in the word distribution, so we simply normalize this over all the words. This is different, in contrast here we normalize the amount all the topics. It would be useful to take a comparison between the two. This give us different distributions. And these tells us how to improve the parameters. And as I just explained, in both the formula is we have a maximum estimate based on allocated word counts [INAUDIBLE]. Now this phenomena is actually general phenomena in all the EM algorithms.

And if it's from a topic, which topic. So if you look at the e-step formulas, essentially we're actually normalizing these counts, sorry, these probabilities of observing the word from each distribution. So you can see, basically the prediction of word from topic zero sub j is based on the probability of selecting that theta sub j as a word distribution to generate the word. Multiply by the probability of observing the word from that distribution. And I said it's proportional to this because in the implementation of EM algorithm you can keep counter for this quantity, and in the end it just normalizes it. So the normalization here is over all the topics and then you would get a probability. Now, in the m-step, we do the same, and we are going to collect these. Allocated account for each topic. And we split words among the topics. And then we're going to normalize them in different ways to obtain the real estimate.

This is essentially the E-step of the EM algorithm where we use Bayes' rule to partition data and allocate all the data points among all the component models in the mixture model. Note that the E-step essentially helped us figure out which words have been generated from $\\theta_d$ (and equivalently, which words have been generated from $\\theta_B$) except that it does not completely allocate a word to $\\theta_d$ (or $\\theta_B$), but splits a word in between the two distributions. That is, $p(z=0|\\text{text})$ tells us what percent of the count of \\emph{text} should be allocated to $\\theta_d$, and thus contribute to the estimate of $\\theta_d$. This way, we", "With the E-step and M-step as the basis, the EM algorithm works as follows. First, we initialize all the (unknown) parameters values randomly. This allows us to have a complete specification of the mixture model, which further enables us to use Bayes' rule to infer which distribution is more likely to generate each word. This prediction (\\ie, E-step) essentially helps us (probabilistically) separate words generated by the two distributions. Finally, we will collect all the probabilistically allocated counts of words belonging to our topic word distribution and normalize them into probabilities, which serve as an improved estimate of the parameters. The process can then be repeated to gradually improve the parameter estimate until the likelihood function reaches a local maximum. The EM algorithm can guarantee reaching such a local maximum, but it cannot guarantee reaching a global maximum when there are multiple local maxima. Due to this, we usually repeat the algorithm multiple times with different initializations in practice, using the run that gives the highest likelihood value to obtain the estimated parameter values.\nSpecifically, the E-step is to infer the value of $z$ for all the words, while the M-step is to use the inferred $z$ values to split word counts between the two distributions, and use the allocated counts for $\\theta_d$ to improve its estimation, leading to a new generation of improved parameter values, which can then be used to perform a new iteration of E-step and M-step to further improve the parameter estimation.\nIn the M-step, we adjust the count $c(w,d)$ based on $p(z=0|w)$ (\\ie, probability that the word $w$ is indeed from $\\theta_d$) so as to obtain a discounted count $c(w,d)p(z=0|w)$ which can be interpreted as the expected count of the event that word $w$ is generated from $\\theta_B$. Similarly, $\\theta_B$ has its own share of the count, which is $c(w,d)p(z=1|w) = c(w,d)[1-p(z=0|w)]$, and we have showing that all the counts of word $w$ have been split between the two distributions.\nThus, the M-step is simply to normalize these discounted counts for all the words to obtain a probability distribution over all the words, which can then be regarded as our improved estimate of $p(w|\\theta_d)$. Note that in the M-step, if $p(z=0|w)=1$ for all words, we would simply compute the simple single unigram language model based on all the observed words (which makes sense since the E-step would have told us that there is no chance that any word has been generated from the background).", "In the first iteration of the EM algorithm, we will apply the E-step to infer\nwhich of the two distributions has been used to generate each word, \\ie, to\ncompute $p(z=0|w)$ and $p(z=1|w)$. We only showed $p(z=0|w)$, which is needed in\nour M-step ($p(z=1|w)=1-p(z=0|w)$). Clearly, $p(z=0|w)$ has different values for\ndifferent words, and this is because these words have different probabilities in\nthe background model and the initialized $\\theta_d$. Thus, even though the two\ndistributions are equally likely (by our prior) and our initial values for\n$p(w|\\theta_d)$ form a uniform distribution, the inferred $p(z=0|w)$ would tend\nto give words with smaller probabilities according to $p(w|\\theta_B)$ a higher\nprobability. For example, $p(z=0|\\text{text}) > p(z=0|\\text{the})$.\nOnce we have the probabilities of all these $z$ values, we can perform the\nM-step, where these probabilities would be used to adjust the counts of the\ncorresponding words. For example, the count of \\emph{the} is 4, but since\n$p(z=0|\\text{the})=0.33$, we would obtain a discounted count of \\emph{the},\n$4\\cdot 0.33$, when estimating $p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ in the M-step.\nSimilarly, the adjusted count for \\emph{text} would be $4\\cdot 0.71$. After the\nM-step, $p(\\text{text}|\\theta_d)$ would be much higher than\n$p(\\text{the}|\\theta_d)$ as shown in the table (shown in the first column under\nIteration 2). Those words that are believed to have come from the topic word\ndistribution $\\theta_d$ according to the E-step would have a higher probability.\nThis new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred\nlatent variable or hidden variable values, leading to a new generation of\nprobabilities for the $z$ values, which can be fed into another M-step to\ngenerate yet another generation of potentially improved estimate of $\\theta_d$.", "The EM algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm. It starts with an initial (random) guess of the optimal parameter value, and then iteratively improves it. The picture shows the scenario of going from iteration $n$ to iteration $n+1$. At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. You might wonder why we don't work on finding an improved parameter value directly on the original likelihood function. Indeed, it is possible to do that, but in the EM algorithm, the auxiliary function is usually much easier to optimize than the original likelihood function, so in this sense, it reduces the problem into a somewhat simpler one. Although the auxiliary function is generally easier to optimize, it does not always have an analytical solution, which means that the maximization of the auxiliary function may itself require another iterative process, which would be embedded in the overall iterative process of the EM algorithm. In our case of the simple mixture model, we did not explicitly compute this auxiliary function in the E-step because the auxiliary function is very simple and as a result, our M-step has an analytical solution, thus we were able to bypass the explicit computation of this auxiliary function and go directly to find a re-estimate of the parameters. Thus in the E-step, we only computed a key component in the auxiliary function, which is the probability that a word has been generated from each of the two distributions, and our M-step directly gives us an analytical solution to the problem of optimizing the auxiliary function, and the solution directly uses the values obtained from the E-step.", "First, it would randomly initialize all the parameters to be estimated. Second, in the E-step, it would attempt to infer the values of the hidden variables based on the current generation of parameters, and obtain a probability distribution of hidden variables over all possible values of these hidden variables. Intuitively, this is to take a good guess of the values of the hidden variables. Third, in the M-step, it would use the inferred hidden variable values to compute an improved estimate of the parameter values.

Our hidden variable $z$, which is a topic indicator for a word, now would take $k+1$ values $\\{1, 2, ..., k, B\\}$, corresponding to the $k$ topics and the extra background topic. The E-step uses Bayes' Rule to infer the probability of each value for $z$ as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-estep}. A comparison between these equations as the E-step for the simple two-component mixture model would reveal immediately that the equations are essentially similar, only now we have more topics. Indeed, if we assume there is just one topic, $k=1$, then we would recover the E-step equation", "The M-step is also similar to that in the simple mixture model. We show the equations in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. We see that a key component in the two equations, for re-estimating $\\pi$ and $p(w|\\theta)$ respectively, is $c(w,d)(1-p(z_{d,w}=B)p(z_{d,w}=j)$, which can be interpreted as the allocated counts of $w$ to topic $\\theta_j$. Intuitively, we use the inferred distribution of $z$ values from the E-step to split the counts of $w$ among all the distributions. The amount of split counts of $w$ that $\\theta_j$ can get is determined based on the inferred likelihood that $w$ is generated by topic $\\theta_j$.\nOnce we have such a split count of each word for each distribution, we can easily pool together these split counts to re-estimate both $\\pi$ and $p(w|\\theta)$ as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-mstep}. To re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$, the probability that document $d$ covers topic $\\theta_j$, we would simply collect all the split counts of words in document $d$ that belong to each $\\theta_j$, and then normalize these counts among all the $k$ topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, we would collect the split counts of a word toward $\\theta_j$ from all the documents in the collection, and then normalize these counts among all the words. Note that the normalizers are very different in these two cases, which are directly related to the constraints we have on these parameters. In the case of re-estimation of $\\pi$, the constraint is that the $\\pi$ values must sum to one for each document, thus our normalizer has been chosen to ensure that the re-estimated values of $\\pi$ indeed sum to one for each document. The same is true for the re-estimation of $p(w|\\theta)$, where our normalizer allows us to obtain a word distribution for each topic.\nWhat we observed here is actually generally true when using the EM algorithm. That is, the distribution of the hidden variables computed in the E-step can be used to compute the expected counts of an event, which can then aggregated and normalized appropriately to obtain a re-estimate of the parameters. In the implementation of the EM algorithm, we can thus just keep the counts of various events and then normalize them appropriately to obtain re-estimates for various parameters.\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-em-comp}, we show the computation of the EM algorithm for PLSA in more detail. We first initialize all the unknown parameters randomly, including the coverage distribution $\\pi_{d,j}$ for each document $d$, and the word distribution for each topic $p(w|\\theta_j)$. After the initialization step, the EM algorithm would go through a loop until the likelihood converges.", "In each iteration, the EM algorithm would first invoke the E-step followed by the M-step. In the E-step, it would augment the data by predicting the hidden variables. In this case, the hidden variable, $z_{d, w}$ indicates whether word $w$ in $d$ is from a ``real'' topic or the background. If it's from a real topic, it determines which of the $k$ topics it is from. From Figure~\\ref{fig:plsa-em-comp}, we see that in the E-step we need to compute the probability of $z$ values for every unique word in each document. Thus we can iterate over all the documents, and for each document, iterate over all the unique words in the document to compute the corresponding $p(z_{d,w})$. This computation involves computing the product of the probability of selecting a topic and the probability of word $w$ given by the selected distribution. We can then normalize these products based on the constraints we have, to ensure $\\sum_{j=1}^k p(z_{d,w}=j)=1$. In this case, the normalization is among all the topics. In the M-step, we will also collect the relevant counts and then normalize appropriately to obtain re-estimates of various parameters. We would use the estimated probability distribution $p(z_{d,w})$ to split the count of word $w$ in document $d$ among all the topics. Note that the same word would generally be split in different ways in different documents. Once we split the counts for all the words in this way, we can aggregate the split counts and normalize them. For example, to re-estimate $\\pi_{d,j}$ (coverage of topic $\\theta_j$ in document $d$), the relevant counts would be the counts of words in $d$ that have been allocated to topic $\\theta_j$, and the normalizer would be the sum of all such counts over all the topics so that after normalization, we would obtain a probability distribution over all the topics. Similarly, to re-estimate $p(w|\\theta_j)$, the relevant counts are the sum of all the split counts of word $w$ in all the documents. These aggregated counts would then be normalized by the sum of such aggregated counts over all the words in the vocabulary so that after normalization, we again would obtain a distribution, this time over all the words rather than all the topics."], "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": ["First, we'll initialize all the parameters with random values. In our case, the parameters are mainly the probability. of a word, given by theta sub d. So this is an initial addition stage. These initialized values would allow us to use base roll to take a guess of these z values, so we'd guess these values. We can't say for sure whether textt is from background or not. But we can have our guess. This is given by this formula. It's called an E-step. And so the algorithm would then try to use the E-step to guess these z values. After that, it would then invoke another that's called M-step. In this step we simply take advantage of the inferred z values and then just group words that are in the same distribution like these from that ground including this as well. We can then normalize the count to estimate the probabilities or to revise our estimate of the parameters. So these will help us estimate these parameters. Note that before we just set these parameter values randomly. But with this guess, we will have somewhat improved estimate of this. Of course, we don't know exactly whether it's zero or one. So we're not going to really do the split in a hard way. But rather we're going to do a softer split. And this is what happened here. So we're going to adjust the count by the probability that would believe this word has been generated by using the theta sub d. And you can see this, where does this come from? Well, this has come from here, right? From the E-step. So the EM Algorithm would iteratively improve uur initial estimate of parameters by using E-step first and then M-step. The E-step is to augment the data with additional information, like z. And the M-step is to take advantage of the additional information to separate the data. To split the data accounts and then collect the right data accounts to re-estimate our parameter. And then once we have a new generation of parameter, we're going to repeat this. We are going the E-step again. To improve our estimate of the hidden variables. And then that would lead to another generation of re-estimated parameters. For the word distribution that we are interested in. Okay, so, as I said, the bridge between the two is really the variable z, hidden variable, which indicates how likely this water is from the top water distribution, theta sub p. So, this slide has a lot of content and you may need to. Pause the reader to digest it. But this basically captures the essence of EM Algorithm. Start with initial values that are often random themself. And then we invoke E-step followed by M-step to get an improved setting of parameters. And then we repeated this, so this a Hill-Climbing algorithm that would gradually improve the estimate of parameters.", "So in this setting we have assumed the two numerals have equal probabilities and the background model is null. So what are the relevance of the statistics? Well these are the word counts. So assume we have just four words, and their counts are like this. And this is our background model that assigns high probabilities to common words like the. And in the first iteration, you can picture what will happen. Well first we initialize all the values. So here, this probability that we're interested in is normalized into a uniform distribution of all the words. And then the E-step would give us a guess of the distribution that has been used. That will generate each word. We can see we have different probabilities for different words. Why? Well, that's because these words have different probabilities in the background. So even though the two distributions are equally likely. And then our initial audition say uniform distribution because of the difference in the background of the distribution, we have different guess the probability. So these words are believed to be more likely from the topic. These on the other hand are less likely. Probably from background. So once we have these z values, we know in the M-step these probabilities will be used to adjust the counts. So four must be multiplied by this 0.33 in order to get the allocated accounts toward the topic. And this is done by this multiplication. Note that if our guess says this is 100 then we just get the full count of this word for this topic. In general it's not going to be one point zero. So we're just going to get some percentage of this counts toward this topic. Then we simply normalize these counts to have a new generation of parameters estimate. So you can see, compare this with the older one, which is here. So compare this with this one and we'll see the probability is different. Not only that, we also see some words that are believed to have come from the topic will have a higher probability. Like this one, text. And of course, this new generation of parameters would allow us to further adjust the inferred latent variable or hidden variable values. So we have a new generation of values, because of the E-step based on the new generation of parameters. And these new inferred values of Zs will give us then another generation of the estimate of probabilities of the word. And so on and so forth so this is what would actually happen when we compute these probabilities using the EM Algorithm.", "So, the E-step is basically to compute this lower bound. We don't directly just compute this likelihood function but we compute the length of the variable values and these are basically a part of this lower bound. This helps determine the lower bound. The M-step on the other hand is to maximize the lower bound. It allows us to move parameters to a new point.

In our model, however, it only depends on the corresponding word $d_{ij}$. The M-step involves maximizing the Q-function. This may sometimes be quite complex as well. But, again, in our case, we can find an analytical solution. In order to achieve this, we use the Lagrange multiplier method since we have the following contraint on the parameter variables $\\{p(w|\\theta_F)\\}_{w \\in V}$, where $V$ is our vocabulary. $$ \\sum_{w \\in V} p(w|\\theta_F)= 1$$ We thus consider the  following auxiliary function $$g(\\theta_F) = Q(\\theta_F; \\theta_F^{(n)})+ \\mu (1-\\sum_{w \\in V} p(w|\\theta_F))$$. and take its derivative w.r.t. each parameter variable $p(w|\\theta_F)$.

At iteration $n$, the current guess of the parameter value is $p^{(n)}(w|\\theta_d)$, and it is seen to be non-optimal in the picture. In the E-step, the EM algorithm (conceptually) computes an auxiliary function which lower bounds the original likelihood function. Lower bounding means that for any given value of $\\theta_d$, the value of this auxiliary function would be no larger than that of the original likelihood function. In the M-step, the EM algorithm finds an optimal parameter value that would maximize the auxiliary function and treat this parameter value as our improved estimate, $p^{(n+1)}(w|\\theta_d)$. Since the auxiliary function is a lower bound of the original likelihood function, maximizing the auxiliary function ensures the new parameter to also have a higher value according to the original likelihood function unless it has already reached a local maximum, in which case, the optimal value maximizing the auxiliary function is also a local maximum of the original likelihood function. This explains why the EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-8924002": 1, "wikipedia-20894986": 1, "wikipedia-20899639": 1, "wikipedia-24334988": 1, "wikipedia-8979437": 1, "wikipedia-470752": 1, "wikipedia-34957160": 1, "wikipedia-52033": 1, "wikipedia-35810608": 1, "wikipedia-33062050": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": 2, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/14": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/12": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/plsa.jsonl/15": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/joint-analysis/social-network.jsonl/4": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/plsa.jsonl/16": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/13": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/26": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-8924002": 1, "wikipedia-20894986": 1, "wikipedia-20899639": 1, "wikipedia-24334988": 1, "wikipedia-8979437": 1, "wikipedia-470752": 1, "wikipedia-34957160": 1, "wikipedia-52033": 1, "wikipedia-35810608": 1, "wikipedia-33062050": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/28": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/29": 3, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/14": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/12": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/plsa.jsonl/15": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/joint-analysis/social-network.jsonl/4": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/plsa.jsonl/16": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/appendix/em.jsonl/13": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/mooc-transcript.jsonl/29": 1, "textbook/textdatabook/topic-analysis/one-topic.jsonl/26": 1}}}
