The victim may experience severe psychological effects. This would involve the tactics of brainwashing, which can fall under psychological abuse as well, but emotional abuse consists of the manipulation of the victim's emotions. The victim may feel their emotions are being affected by the abuser to such an extent that the victim may no longer recognize their own feelings regarding the issues the abuser is trying to control. The result is the victim's self-concept and independence are systematically taken away. The U.S. Department of Justice defines emotionally abusive traits as including causing fear by: intimidation, threatening physical harm to self, partner, children, or partner's family or friends, destruction of pets and property, forcing isolation from family, friends, or school or work. More subtle emotionally abusive behaviors include insults, putdowns, arbitrary and unpredictable behavior, and gaslighting (e.g. the denial that previous abusive incidents occurred).

In 1996, Health Canada argued that emotional abuse is \"based on power and control\", and defines emotional abuse as including rejecting, degrading, terrorizing, isolating, corrupting/exploiting and \"denying emotional responsiveness\" as characteristic of emotional abuse."], "wikipedia-24764596": ["Historical trauma (HT), as used by social workers, historians, and psychologists, refers to the cumulative emotional harm of an individual or generation caused by a traumatic experience or event. Historical Trauma Response (HTR) refers to the manifestation of emotions and actions that stem from this perceived trauma.\nAccording to its advocates, HTR is exhibited in a variety of ways, most prominently through substance abuse, which is used as a vehicle for attempting to numb pain. This model seeks to use this to explain other self-destructive behaviour, such as suicidal thoughts and gestures, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, anger, violence and difficulty recognising and expressing emotions. Many historians and scholars believe the manifestations of violence and abuse in certain communities are directly associated with the unresolved grief that accompanies continued trauma.\nHistorical trauma, and its manifestations, are seen as an example of Transgenerational trauma (though the existence of transgenerational trauma itself is disputed). For example, a pattern of maternal abandonment of a child might be seen across three generations, or the actions of an abusive parent might be seen in continued abuse across generations. These manifestations can also stem from the trauma of events, such as the witnessing of war, genocide, or death. For these populations that have witnessed these mass level traumas (e.g., war, genocide, colonialism), several generations later these populations tend to have higher rates of disease."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Of the many different algorithms, virtually all fall into one of three general categories. The first class consists of void finders that try to find empty regions of space based on local galaxy density. The second class are those which try to find voids via the geometrical structures in the dark matter distribution as suggested by the galaxies. The third class is made up of those finders which identify structures dynamically by using gravitationally unstable points in the distribution of dark matter. The three most popular methods through the study of cosmic voids are listed below:\n\nSection::::Methods for finding.:VoidFinder algorithm.\nThis first-class method uses each galaxy in a catalog as its target and then uses the Nearest Neighbor Approximation to calculate the cosmic density in the region contained in a spherical radius determined by the distance to the third-closest galaxy. El Ad & Piran introduced this method in 1997 to allow a quick and effective method for standardizing the cataloging of voids. Once the spherical cells are mined from all of the structure data, each cell is expanded until the underdensity returns to average expected wall density values. One of the helpful features of void regions is that their boundaries are very distinct and defined, with a cosmic mean density that starts at 10% in the body and quickly rises to 20% at the edge and then to 100% in the walls directly outside the edges. The remaining walls and overlapping void regions are then gridded into, respectively, distinct and intertwining zones of filaments, clusters, and near-empty voids. Any overlap of more than 10% with already known voids are considered to be subregions within those known voids. All voids admitted to the catalog had a minimum radius of 10 Mpc in order to ensure all identified voids were not accidentally cataloged due to sampling errors.\n\nSection::::Methods for finding.:Zone bordering on voidness (ZOBOV) algorithm.\nThis particular second-class algorithm uses a Voronoi tessellation technique and mock border particles in order to categorize regions based on a high-density contrasting border with a very low amount of bias.\nNeyrinck introduced this algorithm in 2008 with the purpose of introducing a method that did not contain free parameters or presumed shape tessellations. Therefore, this technique can create more accurately shaped and sized void regions. Although this algorithm has some advantages in shape and size, it has been criticized often for sometimes providing loosely defined results. Since it has no free parameters, it mostly finds small and trivial voids, although the algorithm places a statistical significance on each void it finds. A physical significance parameter can be applied in order to reduce the number of trivial voids by including a minimum density to average density ratio of at least 1:5. Subvoids are also identified using this process which raises more philosophical questions on what qualifies as a void. Void finders such as VIDE are based on ZOBOV.\n\nSection::::Methods for finding.:Dynamical void analysis (DIVA) algorithm.\nThis third-class method is drastically different from the previous two algorithms listed. The most striking aspect is that it requires a different definition of what it means to be a void. Instead of the general notion that a void is a region of space with a low cosmic mean density; a hole in the distribution of galaxies, it defines voids to be regions in which matter is escaping; which corresponds to the dark energy equation of state, \"w\". Void centers are then considered to be the maximal source of the displacement field denoted as \"S\". The purpose for this change in definitions was presented by Lavaux and Wandelt in 2009 as a way to yield cosmic voids such that exact analytical calculations can be made on their dynamical and geometrical properties. This allows DIVA to heavily explore the ellipticity of voids and how they evolve in the large-scale structure, subsequently leading to the classification of three distinct types of voids. These three morphological classes are True voids, Pancake voids, and Filament voids. Another notable quality is that even though DIVA also contains selection function bias just as first-class methods do, DIVA is devised such that this bias"], "wikipedia-727476": ["In a computer operating system that uses paging for virtual memory management, page replacement algorithms decide which memory pages to page out, sometimes called swap out, or write to disk, when a page of memory needs to be allocated. Page replacement happens when a requested page is not in memory (page fault) and a free page cannot be used to satisfy the allocation, either because there are none, or because the number of free pages is lower than some threshold.\nWhen the page that was selected for replacement and paged out is referenced again it has to be paged in (read in from disk), and this involves waiting for I/O completion. This determines the \"quality\" of the page replacement algorithm: the less time waiting for page-ins, the better the algorithm.\nThe page replacing problem is a typical online problem from the competitive analysis perspective in the sense that the optimal deterministic algorithm is known.\nReplacement algorithms can be \"local\" or \"global.\"\nWhen a process incurs a page fault, a local page replacement algorithm selects for replacement some page that belongs to that same process (or a group of processes sharing a memory partition).\nA global replacement algorithm is free to select any page in memory.\nMarking algorithms is a general class of paging algorithms. For each page, we associate it with a bit called its mark. Initially, we set all pages as unmarked. During a stage of page requests, we mark a page when it is first requested in this stage. A marking algorithm is such an algorithm that never pages out a marked page.\nLRU is a marking algorithm while FIFO is not a marking algorithm.\nLRU, FIFO and CLOCK are conservative algorithms.\nThe theoretically optimal page replacement algorithm (also known as OPT, clairvoyant replacement algorithm, or B\u00e9l\u00e1dy's optimal page replacement policy) is an algorithm that works as follows: when a page needs to be swapped in, the operating system swaps out the page whose next use will occur farthest in the future.\nDespite this limitation, algorithms exist that can offer near-optimal performance \u2014 the operating system keeps track of all pages referenced by the program, and it uses those data to decide which pages to swap in and out on subsequent runs."], "wikipedia-55181525": ["Privacy is currently not being implemented possibly because the personal power and wealth gain from not doing so is acting as a disincentive for both private companies and governments. Also, using data to measure actual social impact could reveal inefficiency which would be inconvenient to the politicians involved or the companies\u2019 claims.\nThe public debate on privacy is often unfairly obscured to an over-simplistic binary choice between privacy and scientific progress. The marketing campaigns have even dismissed critics of centralized data collection as resisting progress and holding on to the past. However, the benefits from scientific progress through data can be achieved in a manner consistent with privacy values as has historically been the case in epidemiological research. The extraction of value from data without compromising identity privacy is certainly possible technologically; e.g., by utilizing homomorphic encryption and algorithmic design which makes reverse engineering difficult.\nHomomorphic encryption allows the chaining together of different services without exposing the data to each of the services. Even the software engineers working on the software would not be able to override the user. Homomorphic encryption schemes are malleable by design meaning they can be used in a cloud computing environment while ensuring the confidentiality of processed data. The technique allows analytical computations to be carried out on cipher text, therefore generating encrypted results which, when decrypted, match the results of operations performed in plain-text.\nThe results of analytics can be presented in such a way as to be fit for purpose without compromising identity privacy. For example, a data sale stating that \u201c20% of Amsterdam eats muesli for breakfast\u201d would transmit the analytical value of data without compromising privacy, whereas saying that \u201cAna eats muesli for breakfast\u201d would not maintain privacy. Algorithmic design and the size of the sample group is critical to minimize the capacity to reverse engineer statistics and track targeted individuals.

One of the helpful features of void regions is that their boundaries are very distinct and defined, with a cosmic mean density that starts at 10% in the body and quickly rises to 20% at the edge and then to 100% in the walls directly outside the edges. The remaining walls and overlapping void regions are then gridded into, respectively, distinct and intertwining zones of filaments, clusters, and near-empty voids. Any overlap of more than 10% with already known voids are considered to be subregions within those known voids. All voids admitted to the catalog had a minimum radius of 10 Mpc in order to ensure all identified voids were not accidentally cataloged due to sampling errors.\nSection::::Methods for finding.:Zone bordering on voidness (ZOBOV) algorithm.\nThis particular second-class algorithm uses a Voronoi tessellation technique and mock border particles in order to categorize regions based on a high-density contrasting border with a very low amount of bias.\nNeyrinck introduced this algorithm in 2008 with the purpose of introducing a method that did not contain free parameters or presumed shape tessellations. Therefore, this technique can create more accurately shaped and sized void regions. Although this algorithm has some advantages in shape and size, it has been criticized often for sometimes providing loosely defined results. Since it has no free parameters, it mostly finds small and trivial voids, although the algorithm places a statistical significance on each void it finds. A physical significance parameter can be applied in order to reduce the number of trivial voids by including a minimum density to average density ratio of at least 1:5. Subvoids are also identified using this process which raises more philosophical questions on what qualifies as a void. Void finders such as VIDE are based on ZOBOV.\nSection::::Methods for finding.:Dynamical void analysis (DIVA) algorithm.\nThis third-class method is drastically different from the previous two algorithms listed. The most striking aspect is that it requires a different definition of what it means to be a void. Instead of the general notion that a void is a region of space with a low cosmic mean density; a hole in the distribution of galaxies, it defines voids to be regions in which matter is escaping; which corresponds to the dark energy equation of state, \"w\". Void centers are then considered to be the maximal source of the displacement field denoted as \"S\". The purpose for this change in definitions was presented by Lavaux and Wandelt in 2009 as a way to yield cosmic voids such that exact analytical calculations can be made on their dynamical and geometrical properties. This allows DIVA to heavily explore the ellipticity of voids and how they evolve in the large-scale structure, subsequently leading to the classification of three distinct types of voids. These three morphological classes are True voids, Pancake voids, and Filament voids. Another notable quality is that even though DIVA also contains selection function bias just as first-class methods do, DIVA is devised such that this bias"], "wikipedia-727476": ["Page replacement algorithms decide which memory pages to page out, sometimes called swap out, or write to disk, when a page of memory needs to be allocated. Page replacement happens when a requested page is not in memory (page fault) and a free page cannot be used to satisfy the allocation, either because there are none, or because the number of free pages is lower than some threshold.\nWhen the page that was selected for replacement and paged out is referenced again it has to be paged in (read in from disk), and this involves waiting for I/O completion. This determines the \"quality\" of the page replacement algorithm: the less time waiting for page-ins, the better the algorithm. A page replacement algorithm looks at the limited information about accesses to the pages provided by hardware, and tries to guess which pages should be replaced to minimize the total number of page misses, while balancing this with the costs (primary storage and processor time) of the algorithm itself.\n\nThe theoretically optimal page replacement algorithm (also known as OPT, clairvoyant replacement algorithm, or B\u00e9l\u00e1dy's optimal page replacement policy) is an algorithm that works as follows: when a page needs to be swapped in, the operating system swaps out the page whose next use will occur farthest in the future.

Each candidate solution has a set of properties (its chromosomes or genotype) which can be mutated and altered; traditionally, solutions are represented in binary as strings of 0s and 1s, but other encodings are also possible.\n\nThe evolution usually starts from a population of randomly generated individuals, and is an iterative process, with the population in each iteration called a \"generation\". In each generation, the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated; the fitness is usually the value of the objective function in the optimization problem being solved. The more fit individuals are stochastically selected from the current population, and each individual's genome is modified (recombined and possibly randomly mutated) to form a new generation.\n\nOnce the genetic representation and the fitness function are defined, a GA proceeds to initialize a population of solutions and then to improve it through repetitive application of the mutation, crossover, inversion and selection operators.\n\nThe next step is to generate a second generation population of solutions from those selected through a combination of genetic operators: crossover (also called recombination), and mutation.\n\nFor each new solution to be produced, a pair of \"parent\" solutions is selected for breeding from the pool selected previously. By producing a \"child\" solution using the above methods of crossover and mutation, a new solution is created which typically shares many of the characteristics of its \"parents\". New parents are selected for each new child, and the process continues until a new population of solutions of appropriate size is generated.\n\nThese processes ultimately result in the next generation population of chromosomes that is different from the initial generation. Generally the average fitness will have increased by this procedure for the population, since only the best organisms from the first generation are selected for breeding, along with a small proportion of less fit solutions.

The selection of objects that will be inherited from in each successive generation is determined by a fitness function, which varies depending upon the problem being addressed. The traits of these objects are passed on through chromosomes by a means similar to biological reproduction. These chromosomes are generally represented by a series of genes, which in turn are usually represented using binary numbers. This propagation of traits between generations is similar to the inheritance of traits between generations of biological organisms. This process can also be viewed as a form of reinforcement learning, because the evolution of the objects is driven by the passing of traits from successful objects which can be viewed as a reward for their success, thereby promoting beneficial traits.\n\nOnce a new generation is ready to be created, all of the individuals that have been successful and have been chosen for reproduction are randomly paired together. Then the traits of these individuals are passed on through a combination of crossover and mutation. This process follows these basic steps:\nBULLET::::1.

The selection of objects that will be inherited from in each successive generation is determined by a fitness function, which varies depending upon the problem being addressed.\nThe traits of these objects are passed on through chromosomes by a means similar to biological reproduction. These chromosomes are generally represented by a series of genes, which in turn are usually represented using binary numbers. This propagation of traits between generations is similar to the inheritance of traits between generations of biological organisms. This process can also be viewed as a form of reinforcement learning, because the evolution of the objects is driven by the passing of traits from successful objects which can be viewed as a reward for their success, thereby promoting beneficial traits.\nSection::::Process.\nOnce a new generation is ready to be created, all of the individuals that have been successful and have been chosen for reproduction are randomly paired together. Then the traits of these individuals are passed on through a combination of crossover and mutation. This process follows these basic steps:\nBULLET::::1. Pair off successful objects for mating.\nBULLET::::2. Determine randomly a crossover point for each pair.\nBULLET::::3. Switch the genes after the crossover point in each pair.\nBULLET::::4. Determine randomly if any genes are mutated in the child objects.\nAfter following these steps, two child objects will be produced for every pair of parent objects used.

Neutral evolution can therefore be visualised as a population diffusing from one set of sequence nodes, through the neutral network, to another cluster of sequence nodes. Since the majority of evolution is thought to be neutral, a large proportion of gene change is the movement though expansive neutral networks.\n\nThe more neutral neighbours a sequence has, the more robust to mutations it is since mutations are more likely to simply neutrally convert it into an equally functional sequence. Indeed, if there are large differences between the number of neutral neighbours of different sequences within a neutral network, the population is predicted to evolve towards these robust sequences. This is sometimes called circum-neutrality and represents the movement of populations away from cliffs in the fitness landscape.\n\nBy definition, all genes in a neutral network have equivalent function, however some may exhibit promiscuous activities which could serve as starting points for adaptive evolution towards new functions. In terms of sequence space, current theories predict that if the neutral networks for two different activities overlap, a neutrally evolving population may diffuse to regions of the neutral network of the first activity that allow it to access the second. This would only be the case when the distance between activities is smaller than the distance that a neutrally evolving population can cover.

Transhumanists are often concerned with methods of enhancing the human nervous system. Though some, such as Kevin Warwick, propose modification of the peripheral nervous system, the brain is considered the common denominator of personhood and is thus a primary focus of transhumanist ambitions.\n\nIn fact, Warwick has gone a lot further than merely making a proposal. In 2002 he had a 100 electrode array surgically implanted into the median nerves of his left arm in order to link his nervous system directly with a computer and thus to also connect with the internet. As a consequence, he carried out a series of experiments. He was able to directly control a robot hand using his neural signals and to feel the force applied by the hand through feedback from the fingertips. He also experienced a form of ultrasonic sensory input and conducted the first purely electronic communication between his own nervous system and that of his wife who also had electrodes implanted.\n\nAs proponents of self-improvement and body modification, transhumanists tend to use existing technologies and techniques that supposedly improve cognitive and physical performance, while engaging in routines and lifestyles designed to improve health and longevity. Depending on their age, some transhumanists express concern that they will not live to reap the benefits of future technologies. However, many have a great interest in life extension strategies and in funding research in cryonics in order to make the latter a viable option of last resort, rather than remaining an unproven method.\n\nTranshumanists support the emergence and convergence of technologies including nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science (NBIC), as well as hypothetical future technologies like simulated reality, artificial intelligence, superintelligence, 3D bioprinting, mind uploading, chemical brain preservation and cryonics. They believe that humans can and should use these technologies to become more than human."], "wikipedia-33820872": ["In order to reduce the number of musculoskeletal DOFs upon which the nervous system must operate, it has been proposed that the nervous system controls muscle synergies, or groups of co-activated muscles, rather than individual muscles. Specifically, a muscle synergy has been defined as \"a vector specifying a pattern of relative muscle activation; absolute activation of each synergy is thought to be modulated by a single neural command signal.\" Multiple muscles are contained within each synergy at fixed ratios of co-activation, and multiple synergies can contain the same muscle. It has been proposed that muscle synergies emerge from an interaction between constraints and properties of the nervous and musculoskeletal systems. This organization may require less computational effort for the nervous system than individual muscle control because fewer synergies are needed to explain a behavior than individual muscles. Furthermore, it has been proposed that synergies themselves may change as behaviors are learned and/or optimized. However, synergies may also be innate to some degree, as suggested by postural responses of humans at very young ages.\n\nBernstein suggested that as humans learn a movement, we first reduce our DOFs by stiffening the musculature in order to have tight control, then gradually \"loosen up\" and explore the available DOFs as the task becomes more comfortable, and from there find an optimal solution. In terms of optimal control, it has been postulated that the nervous system can learn to find task-specific variables through an optimal control search strategy. It has been shown that adaptation in a visuomotor reaching task becomes optimally tuned so that the cost of movement trajectories decreases over trials. These results suggest that the nervous system is capable of both nonadaptive and adaptive processes of optimal control.\n\nThe force control hypothesis states that the nervous system uses calculation and direct specification of forces to determine movement trajectories and reduce DOFs. In this theory, the nervous system must form internal models\u2014a representation of the body's dynamics in terms of the surrounding environment. A nervous system which controls force must generate torques based on predicted kinematics, a process called inverse dynamics. Both feed-forward (predictive) and feedback models of motion in the nervous system may play a role in this process.\n\nIt has been noted that the nervous system controls particular variables relevant to performance of a task, while leaving other variables free to vary; this is called the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis (UCM). The uncontrolled manifold is defined as the set of variables not affecting task performance; variables perpendicular to this set in Jacobian space are considered controlled variables (CM). For example, during a sit-to-stand task, head and center-of-mass position in the horizontal plane are more tightly controlled than other variables such as hand motion."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Though some, such as Kevin Warwick, propose modification of the peripheral nervous system, the brain is considered the common denominator of personhood and is thus a primary focus of transhumanist ambitions.\n\nIn fact, Warwick has gone a lot further than merely making a proposal. In 2002 he had a 100 electrode array surgically implanted into the median nerves of his left arm in order to link his nervous system directly with a computer and thus to also connect with the internet. As a consequence, he carried out a series of experiments. He was able to directly control a robot hand using his neural signals and to feel the force applied by the hand through feedback from the fingertips. He also experienced a form of ultrasonic sensory input and conducted the first purely electronic communication between his own nervous system and that of his wife who also had electrodes implanted.\n\nAs proponents of self-improvement and body modification, transhumanists tend to use existing technologies and techniques that supposedly improve cognitive and physical performance, while engaging in routines and lifestyles designed to improve health and longevity. Depending on their age, some transhumanists express concern that they will not live to reap the benefits of future technologies. However, many have a great interest in life extension strategies and in funding research in cryonics in order to make the latter a viable option of last resort, rather than remaining an unproven method.\n\nWhile most transhumanist theory focuses on future technologies and the changes they may bring, many today are already involved in the practice on a very basic level. It is not uncommon for many to receive cosmetic changes to their physical form via cosmetic surgery, even if it is not required for health reasons. Human growth hormones attempt to alter the natural development of shorter children or those who have been born with a physical deficiency. Doctors prescribe medicines such as Ritalin and Adderall to improve cognitive focus, and many people take \"lifestyle\" drugs such as Viagra, Propecia, and Botox to restore aspects of youthfulness that have been lost in maturity.\n\nTranshumanists support the emergence and convergence of technologies including nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science (NBIC), as well as hypothetical future technologies like simulated reality, artificial intelligence, superintelligence, 3D bioprinting, mind uploading, chemical brain preservation and cryonics. They believe that humans can and should use these technologies to become more than human. Therefore, they support the recognition and/or protection of cognitive liberty, morphological freedom and procreative liberty as civil liberties, so as to guarantee individuals the choice of using human enhancement technologies on themselves and their children. Some speculate that human enhancement techniques and other emerging technologies may facilitate more radical human enhancement no later than at the midpoint of the 21st century.\n\nNeuroscientist Anders Sandberg has been practicing on the method of scanning ultra-thin sections of the brain. This method is being used to help better understand the architecture of the brain. As of now, this method is currently being used on mice. This is the first step towards uploading contents of the human brain, including memories and emotions, onto a computer."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

By taking the time to develop a clear idea of what both partners want out of the openness of a relationship, it allows the parties involved to self-reflect, process their emotions, deal with possible conflicts, and (for those transitioning from monogamy to nonmonogamy) find ways to cope with the change.\nNegotiating the details of the open relationship is important throughout the communication process. Topics that are commonly found in negotiations between couples include honesty, the level of maintenance, trust, boundaries and time management.\nOther tools that couples utilize in the negotiation process include allowing partners to veto new relationships, prior permission, and interaction between partners. This helps to reassure each partner in the relationship that their opinion is important and matters. However, although ability to veto can be a useful tool in negotiation, a successful negotiation and open relationship can still occur without it. Some reject veto power because they believe it limits their partner from experiencing a new relationship and limits their freedom.\nSection::::Successful open relationships.:Boundaries.\nTypes of boundaries include physical, which is along the lines of not touching someone without permission being given; sexual boundaries; and emotional boundaries, which is avoiding the discussion of specific emotions. Boundaries help to set out rules for what is and is not acceptable to the members of the relationship. They also help people to feel safe and that they are just as important in the open relationship as their partners.\nExamples of boundaries that are set could include:\nBULLET::::- Who (geographically and interpersonally, such as in the community, friends, family, et cetera) could be an additional partner;\nBULLET::::- What types of physical limits are placed on that relationship (kissing, dating, or other sexual activities);\nBULLET::::- Whether sexual relations will take place in a separate bedroom, playroom or premises (e.g. hotel).\nSome couples create a physical relationship contract. These can be useful in not only negotiating, but also clearly articulating the needs, wants, limits, expectations, and commitments that are expected of the parties involved.\nSection::::Successful open relationships.:Time management.\nAdequate time management can contribute to the success of an open relationship. Even though having a serious commitment with one partner is common, negotiating the time spent among all partners is still important. Although the desire to give an unlimited amount of love, energy, and emotion to others is common, the limited amount of time in a day limits the actual time spent with each partner. Some find that if they cannot evenly distribute their time, they forego a partner.

Some first dates may lead to a romantic relationship that can range in duration from short period to a long period.\n\nIn one sense, the purpose of a first date is the same as the purpose of any subsequent date: it is an opportunity for the two people to meet. However, the first date differs in that it is often used to screen potential dating candidates. If a person displays behaviours deemed to be negative, the other person may decide to not meet again. In some cases, one or both parties may decide to end the date before the end of the activity they are engaged in. Because they often set the tone for the relationship, first dates are highly important.\n\nMongeau's research shows that the term \"date' can be condensed into four subcategories:\n1. Dyadic: The purpose for which the date is occurring between two individuals.\n2. Date cycle: Includes the major behavior components of a date.\n3. Positive interaction expectancies: Implies that dates allow each other a chance to get to know one another in a comfortable environment.\n4. Sexual overtones: Refers to the part of the date where romantic relationships may develop or include sexual attraction or expectation.\n\nIn the 2004 study done by Mongeau, he quotes Roscoe, who identifies six purposes for dating:\n\u2022 Recreation (to have fun)\n\u2022 Socialization (to get to know the partner)\n\u2022 Status grading (increasing social status by dating an attractive partner)\n\u2022 Companionship (finding a friend to do things with)\n\u2022 Mate selection/courtship (finding a spouse)\n\u2022 Intimacy (establishing a meaningful relationship)\n\nCommunicator characteristics include all of the features of the individual, such as personality, physical appearance, and communication style. These characteristics can lead the partner to predict how the other will communicate in a \u201cdating\u201d situation. The relationship factor involves characteristics that describe the relationship between the two individuals. These factors include the degree of familiarity, liking, attraction, or similarity. The context feature involves aspects like the environment and the situations the individuals are in such as privacy, formality, and task oriented. These situations either enhance or diminish the interaction on the date and help maintain and structure individual's goals.\n\nThe three most common goals that people have on first dates are to reduce uncertainty, achieve relational escalation, and to have fun.\n\nAccording to the study done by Alice Eagly, a professor in Psychology at Northwestern University and Wendy Wood, also a professor in the same department, about sex differences in human behavior, they give the idea that both men and women are looking for certain attractiveness that fits their taste and style. The study states \u201cthe value of attractiveness stems from its perceived association with the ability to provide sexual pleasure.\u201d This means that attractiveness suggests information about \u201csexual warmth\u201d or sexual arousal. The study then proceeds to say that if this is true, then men will seek sexiness in a partner. In addition they will also look for characteristics such as domestic skills. However, Wood and Eagly go on to say \u201cgiven that the female gender role contains sexual restraint and lacks sexual autonomy, women place less importance on sexiness in a partner.\u201d\n\nWomen look for certain cues on a first date: For example, it is important to a woman to find out if the man is courteous or not. Women will look for this by observing if the man comes to the door to pick her up or if he opens doors for her, or compliments her on how she looks, for example. If some of her expectations are not met, mainly the most important ones, she will not want to pursue anything more than a friendship."], "wikipedia-9955624": ["A committed relationship is an interpersonal relationship based upon a mutually agreed-upon commitment to one another involving love, trust, honesty, openness, or some other behavior.

This is like anticipating the behaviour of both a tiger or a giraffe when faced with food options. The tiger has a structure that allows it to have speed, strength and sharp inbuilt weapons to kill moving prey, but the giraffe has a structure that allows it to acquire its food in high places in a way the tiger could not duplicate.

Autonomous organizations or institutions are independent or self-governing. Autonomy can also be defined from a human resources perspective, where it denotes a (relatively high) level of discretion granted to an employee in his or her work. In such cases, autonomy is known to generally increase job satisfaction. Autonomy is a term that is also widely used in the field of medicine \u2014 personal autonomy is greatly recognized and valued in health care.\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) defined autonomy by three themes regarding contemporary ethics. Firstly, autonomy as the right for one to make their own decisions excluding any interference from others. Secondly, autonomy as the capacity to make such decisions through one's own independence of mind and after personal reflection. Thirdly, as an ideal way of living life autonomously. In summary, autonomy is the moral right one possesses, or the capacity we have in order to think and make decisions for oneself providing some degree of control or power over the events that unfold within one's everyday life.\n\nThe Kantian concept of autonomy is often misconstrued, leaving out the important point about the autonomous agent's self-subjection to the moral law. It is thought that autonomy is fully explained as the ability to obey a categorical command independently of a personal desire or interest in doing so\u2014or worse, that autonomy is \"obeying\" a categorical command independently of a natural desire or interest; and that heteronomy, its opposite, is acting instead on personal motives of the kind referenced in hypothetical imperatives.\n\nIn his \"Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals\", Kant applied the concept of autonomy also to define the concept of personhood and human dignity. Autonomy, along with rationality, are seen by Kant as the two criteria for a meaningful life. Kant would consider a life lived without these not worth living; it would be a life of value equal to that of a plant or insect. According to Kant autonomy is part of the reason that we hold others morally accountable for their actions. Human actions are morally praise- or blame-worthy in virtue of our autonomy. Non- autonomous beings such as plants or animals are not blameworthy due to their actions being non-autonomous. Kant's position on crime and punishment is influenced by his views on autonomy. Brainwashing or drugging criminals into being law-abiding citizens would be immoral as it would not be respecting their autonomy. Rehabilitation must be sought in a way that respects their autonomy and dignity as human beings."], "wikipedia-5585849": ["In a management or organizational system based on responsible autonomy, an individual or a group has autonomy to decide what to do, but is accountable for the outcome of the decision. It might be called \u2018no rule\u2019, or rather, no external rule. The existence of accountability makes responsible autonomy similar to anarchy (self-organized society). Responsible autonomy requires clearly defined boundaries at which external direction stops."], "wikipedia-51884528": ["Autonomous agency theory (AAT) is a viable system theory (VST) which models autonomous social complex adaptive systems. It can be used to model the relationship between an agency and its environment(s), and these may include other interactive agencies. The nature of that interaction is determined by both the agency's external and internal attributes and constraints. Internal attributes may include immanent dynamic \"self\" processes that drive agency change.\n\nAAT is a generic modelling approach that has the capacity to anticipate future potentials for behaviour. Such anticipation occurs because behaviour in the agency as a living system is \"structure determined\", where the structure itself of the agency is responsible for that anticipation. This is like anticipating the behaviour of both a tiger or a giraffe when faced with food options. The tiger has a structure that allows it to have speed, strength and sharp inbuilt weapons to kill moving prey, but the giraffe has a structure that allows it to acquire its food in high places in a way the tiger could not duplicate. Even if a giraffe has the speed to chase prey, it does not have the resources to kill and eat it.\n\nAgency generic structure is a substructure defined by three systems that are, in general terms, referred to as:\nBULLET::::- existential (pattern of thematic relevance that is the consequence of experience);\nBULLET::::- noumenal (representing the nature of a phenomenal effect subjectively through conceptual relationships)\nBULLET::::- phenomenal (maintaining patterns of context related structural relevance connected with action, and constituting an origin for experience).\n\nThese generic systems are ontologically distinct; their natures being determined by the context in which the autonomous agency exists. The substructure also maintains a superstructure that is constructed through context related propositional theory. Superstructural theory may include attributes of collective identity, cognition, emotion, personality; purpose and intention; self-reference, self-awareness, self-reflection, self-regulation and self-organisation. The substructural systems are connected by autopoietic and autogenetic networks of processes as shown in Figure 1 below."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

You may use the same control criteria and perhaps subcriteria for all of the four merits. If a control criterion or subcriterion has a global priority of 3% or less, you may consider carefully eliminating it from further consideration. The software automatically deals only with those criteria or subcriteria that have subnets under them. For benefits and opportunities, ask what gives the most benefits or presents the greatest opportunity to influence fulfillment of that control criterion. For costs and risks, ask what incurs the most cost or faces the greatest risk. Sometimes (very rarely), the comparisons are made simply in terms of benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks by aggregating all the criteria of each BOCR into their merit.\nBULLET::::3.

The synthesized ideals for all the control criteria under each merit may result in an ideal whose priority is less than one for that merit.

Network formation hypotheses are tested by using either a dynamic model with an increasing network size or by making an agent-based model to determine which network structure is the equilibrium in a fixed-size network.\n\nSection::::Dynamic models.\nA dynamic model, often used by physicists and biologists, begins as a small network or even a single node. The modeler then uses a (usually randomized) rule on how newly arrived nodes form links in order to increase the size of the network. The aim is to determine what the properties the network will be when it grows in size. In this way, researchers try to reproduce properties common in most real networks, such as the small world network property or the scale-free network property. These properties are common in almost every real network including the World Wide Web, the metabolic network or the network of international air routes.\nThe oldest model of this type is the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model, in which new nodes randomly choose other nodes to connect to. A second well-known model is the Watts and Strogatz model, which starts from a standard two-dimensional lattice and evolves by replacing links randomly. These models display some realistic network properties, but fail to account for others.\nOne of the most influential models of network formation is the Barab\u00e1si-Albert model. Here, the network also starts from a small system, and incoming nodes choose their links randomly, but the randomization is not uniform. Instead, nodes which already possess a greater number of links will have a higher likelihood of becoming connected to incoming nodes. This mechanism is known as preferential attachment. In comparison to previous models, the Barabbas-Albert model seems to more accurately reflect phenomena observed in real-world networks.\n\nSection::::Agent-based models.\nThe second approach to model network formation is agent- or game theory-based modelling. In these models, a network with fixed number of nodes or agents is created. Every agent is given utility function, a representation of its linking preferences, and directed to form links with other nodes based upon it. Usually, forming or maintaining a link will have a cost, but having connections to other nodes will have benefits. The method tests the hypothesis that, given some initial setting and parameter values, a certain network structure will emerge as an equilibrium of this game. Since the number of nodes usually fixed, they can very rarely explain the properties of huge real-world networks; however, they are very useful to examine the network formation in smaller groups.\nJackson and Wolinsky pioneered these types of models in a 1996 paper, which has since inspired several game-theoretic models. These models were further developed by Jackson and Watts, who put this approach to a dynamic setting to see how the network structure evolve over time.\nUsually, games with known network structure are widely applicable; however, there are various settings when players interact without fully knowing who their neighbors are and what the network structure is. These games can be modeled using incomplete information network games.\n\nSection::::Growing networks in agent-based setting.\nThere are very few models that try to combine the two approaches. However, in 2007, Jackson and Rogers modeled a growing network in which new nodes chose their connections partly based on random choices and partly based on maximizing their utility function. With this general framework, modelers can reproduce almost every stylized trait of real-life networks."], "wikipedia-11230690": ["In order to achieve autognosis, networks need a means to:\nBULLET::::- Continuously monitor/test the network for application-specific performance\nBULLET::::- Analyze the monitoring/test data to detect problems (e.g., performance degradation)\nBULLET::::- Diagnose, identify and localize sources of degradation\nBULLET::::- Automatically take actions to resolve problems via remediation/provisioning\nBULLET::::- Verify the problems have been resolved (potentially rolling back changes if ineffective)\nBULLET::::- Subsequently continue to monitor/test for performance"], "wikipedia-1988689": ["Another approach which deals more with the semantic content of cognitive science is connectionism or neural network modeling. Connectionism relies on the idea that the brain consists of simple units or nodes and the behavioral response comes primarily from the layers of connections between the nodes and not from the environmental stimulus itself.\n\nConnectionist network differs from computational modeling specifically because of two functions: neural back-propagation and parallel-processing. Neural back-propagation is a method utilized by connectionist network to show evidence of learning. After a connectionist network produce a response, the stimulated results are compared to real-life situational results. The feedback provided by the backward propagation of errors would be used to improve accuracy for the network\u2019s subsequent responses. The second function, parallel-processing, stemmed from the belief that knowledge and perception are not limited to specific modules but rather are distributed throughout the cognitive networks. The present of parallel distributed processing has been shown in psychological demonstrations like the Stroop effect, where the brain seems to be analyzing the perception of color and meaning of language at the same time. However, this theoretical approach has been continually disproved because the two cognitive functions for color-perception and word-forming are operating separately and simultaneously, not parallel of each other."], "wikipedia-4674326": ["Network performance could be measured using either active or passive techniques. Active techniques (e.g. Iperf) are more intrusive but are arguably more accurate. Passive techniques have less network overhead and hence can run in the background to be used to trigger network management actions.\n\nVarious software tools are available to measure network traffic. Some tools measure traffic by sniffing and others use SNMP, WMI or other local agents to measure bandwidth use on individual machines and routers. However, the latter generally do not detect the type of traffic, nor do they work for machines which are not running the necessary agent software, such as rogue machines on the network, or machines for which no compatible agent is available. In the latter case, inline appliances are preferred. These would generally 'sit' between the LAN and the LAN's exit point, generally the WAN or Internet router, and all packets leaving and entering the network would go through them. In most cases the appliance would operate as a bridge on the network so that it is undetectable by users.\n\nMeasurement tools generally have these functions and features:\nBULLET::::- User interface (web, graphical, console)\nBULLET::::- Real-time traffic graphs\nBULLET::::- Network activity is often reported against pre-configured traffic matching rules to show:\nBULLET::::- Local IP address\nBULLET::::- Remote IP address\nBULLET::::- Port number or protocol\nBULLET::::- Logged in user name\nBULLET::::- Bandwidth quotas\nBULLET::::- Support for traffic shaping or rate limiting (overlapping with the network traffic control page)\nBULLET::::- Support website blocking and content filtering\nBULLET::::- Alarms to notify the administrator of excessive usage (by IP address or in total)"], "wikipedia-18213479": ["The method can be viewed as the inverse problem of network analysis.

Synthesize the limiting priorities by weighting each idealized limit vector by the weight of its control criterion and adding the resulting vectors for each of the four merits: Benefits (B), Opportunities (O), Costs (C) and Risks (R). There are now four vectors, one for each of the four merits. An answer involving ratio values of the merits is obtained by forming the ratio BO / CR for alternative i from each of the four vectors. The synthesized ideals for all the control criteria under each merit may result in an ideal whose priority is less than one for that merit. Only an alternative that is ideal for all the control criteria under a merit receives the value one after synthesis for that merit. The alternative with the largest ratio is chosen for some decisions. Companies and individuals with limited resources often prefer this type of synthesis.\nBULLET::::11. Determine strategic criteria and their priorities to rate the top ranked (ideal) alternative for each of the four merits one at a time. Normalize the four ratings thus obtained and use them to calculate the overall synthesis of the four vectors. For each alternative, subtract the sum of the weighted costs and risks from the sum of the weighted benefits and opportunities.\nBULLET::::12. Perform sensitivity analysis on the final outcome. Sensitivity analysis is concerned with \u201cwhat if\u201d kinds of questions to see if the final answer is stable to changes in the inputs, whether judgments or priorities. Of special interest is to see if these changes change the order of the alternatives.

Tools that are currently employed in risk assessment are often sufficient, but model complexity and limitations of computational power can tether risk assessors to involve more causal connections and account for more Black Swan event outcomes. By applying network theory tools to risk assessment, computational limitations may be overcome and result in broader coverage of events with a narrowed range of uncertainties. Employing networks in the risk analysis process can visualize causal relationships and identify heavily-weighted or important contributors to the probability of the critical event.

Using those two characteristics, researchers have attempted to apply classifications to better evaluate and organize existing crowd simulators.\nBULLET::::- Flow-based Approach: Flow based crowd simulations focus on the crowd as a whole rather than its components. As such individuals do not have any distinctive behaviors that occur due to input from their surroundings and behavioral factors are largely reduced. This model is mainly used to estimate the flow of movement of a large and dense crowd in a given environment. Best used in studying large crowd, short time objectives.\nBULLET::::- Entity-based Approach: Models that implement a set of physical, predefined, and global laws meant to simulate social/psychological factors that occur in individuals that are a part of a crowd fall under this category. Entities in this case do not have the capacity to, in a sense, think for themselves. All movements are determined by the global laws being enforced on them. Simulations that use this model often do so to research crowd dynamics such as jamming and flocking. Small to medium-sized crowds with short term objectives fit this approach best.\nBULLET::::- Agent-based Approach: Characterized by autonomous, interacting individuals. Each agent of a crowd in this approach, is given a degree of intelligence; they can react to each situation on their own based on a set of decision rules. Information used to decide on an action is obtained locally from the agent's\u2019 surroundings. Most often, this approach is used for simulating realistic crowd behavior as the researcher is given complete freedom to implement any behaviors."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. **Yes**  \n\n2.

For example, if in a search task the reaction times vary proportionally with the number of elements, then it is evident that this cognitive process of searching involves serial instead of parallel processing.\nBULLET::::- \"Psychophysical responses.\" Psychophysical experiments are an old psychological technique, which has been adopted by cognitive psychology. They typically involve making judgments of some physical property, e.g. the loudness of a sound. Correlation of subjective scales between individuals can show cognitive or sensory biases as compared to actual physical measurements. Some examples include:\nBULLET::::- sameness judgments for colors, tones, textures, etc.\nBULLET::::- threshold differences for colors, tones, textures, etc.\nBULLET::::- \"Eye tracking.\" This methodology is used to study a variety of cognitive processes, most notably visual perception and language processing.

Researchers utilizing the observational method can exert varying amounts of control over the environment in which the observation takes place. This makes observational research a sort of middle ground between the highly controlled method of experimental design and the less structured approach of conducting interviews.\n\nSection::::Sampling behavior.\nSection::::Sampling behavior.:Time sampling.\nTime sampling is a sampling method that involves the acquisition of representative samples by observing subjects at different time intervals. These time intervals can be chosen randomly or systematically. If a researcher chooses to use systematic time sampling, the information obtained would only generalize to the one time period in which the observation took place. In contrast, the goal of random time sampling would be to be able to generalize across all times of observation. Depending on the type of study being conducted, either type of time sampling can be appropriate.\nAn advantage to using time sampling is that you gain the ability to control the contexts to which you'll eventually be able to generalize. However, time sampling is not useful if the event pertaining to your research question occurs infrequently or unpredictably, because you will often miss the event in the short time period of observation. In this scenario, \"event sampling\" is more useful. In this style of sampling, the researcher lets the event determine when the observations will take place. For example: if the research question involves observing behavior during a specific holiday, one would use event sampling instead of time sampling.\nSection::::Sampling behavior.:Situation sampling.\nSituation sampling involves the study of behavior in many different locations, and under different circumstances and conditions. By sampling different situations, researchers reduce the chance that the results they obtain will be particular to a certain set of circumstances or conditions. For this reason, situation sampling significantly increases the external validity of observational findings. Compared to when researchers only observe particular types of individuals, researchers using situation sampling can increase the diversity of subjects within their observed sample.\nResearchers may determine which subjects to observe by either selecting subjects systematically (every 10th student in a cafeteria, for example) or randomly, with the goal of obtaining a representative sample of all subjects.\nFor a good example of situation sampling, see this study by LaFrance and Mayo concerning the differences in the use of gaze direction as a regulatory mechanism in conversation. In this study, pairs of individuals were observed in college cafeterias, restaurants, airport and hospital waiting rooms, and business-district fast-food outlets. By using situation sampling, the investigators were able to observe a wide range of people who differed in age, sex, race, and socioeconomic class, thus increasing the external validity of their research findings.\nSection::::Direct observational methods.\nSection::::Direct observational methods.:Observation without intervention.\nIf researchers wish to study how subjects normally behave in a given setting, they will want to utilize observation without intervention, also known as naturalistic observation. This type of observation is useful because it allows observers to see how individuals act in natural settings, rather than in the more artificial setting of a lab or experiment. A natural setting can be defined as a place in which behavior ordinarily occurs and that has not been arranged specifically for the purpose of observing behavior. Direct observation is also necessary if researchers want to study something that is unethical to control for in a lab. For instance, the IRB does not allow researchers interested in investigating verbal abuse between adolescent couples to place couples in laboratory settings where verbal abuse is encouraged. However, by placing oneself in a public space where this abuse may occur, one can observe this behavior without being responsible for causing it. Naturalistic observation can also be used to verify external validity, permitting researchers to examine whether study findings generalize to real world scenarios. Naturalistic observation may also be conducted in lieu of structured experiments when implementing an experiment would be too costly. Observation without intervention may be either overt (meaning that subjects are aware they are being observed) or covert (meaning that subjects are not aware).\nThere are several disadvantages and limitations to naturalistic observation. One is that it does not allow researchers to make causal statements about the situations they observe. For this reason, behavior can only be described, not explained. Furthermore, there are ethical concerns related to observing individuals without their consent. One way to avoid this problem is to debrief subjects after observing them, and ask for their consent then, before using the observations for research. This tactic would also help avoid one of the pitfalls of overt observation, in which observers ask for consent before observation has started. In these situations, when subjects know they are being watched, they may alter their behavior in an attempt to make themselves look more admirable. Naturalistic observation may also be time consuming, sometimes requiring dozens of observation sessions lasting large parts of each day to collect information on the behavior of interest. Lastly, because behavior is perceived so subjectively, it's possible that different observers notice different things, or draw different conclusions from their observations.\nSection::::Direct observational methods.:Observation with intervention.\nMost psychological research uses observation with some component of intervention. Reasons for intervening include:to precipitate or cause an event that normally occurs infrequently in nature or is difficult to observe; to systematically vary the qualities of a stimulus event so as to investigate the limits of an organism's response; to gain access to a situation or event that is generally closed to scientific observation; to arrange conditions so that important antecedent events are controlled and consequent behaviors can be readily observed; and to establish a comparison by manipulating independent variables to determine their effects on behavior. There are three different methods of direction observation with intervention: participant observation, structured observation, and field experiments.\nSection::::Direct observational methods.:Observation with intervention.:Participant observation.\nParticipate observation is characterized as either undisguised or disguised. In undisguised observation, the observed individuals know that the observer is present for the purpose of collecting info about their behavior. This technique is often used to understand the culture and behavior of groups or individuals. In contrast, in disguised observation, the observed individuals do not know that they are being observed. This technique is often used when researchers believe that the individuals under observation may change their behavior as a result of knowing that they were being recorded. For a great example of disguised research, see the Rosenhan experiment in which several researchers seek admission to twelve different mental hospitals to observe patient-staff interactions and patient diagnosing and releasing procedures. \nThere are several benefits to doing participant observation. Firstly, participant research allows researchers to observe behaviors and situations that are not usually open to scientific observation. Furthermore, participant research allows the observer to have the same experiences as the people under study, which may provide important insights and understandings of individuals or groups.\nHowever, there are also several drawbacks to doing participant observation. Firstly, participant observers may sometimes lose their objectivity as a result of participating in the study. This usually happens when observers begin to identify with the individuals under study, and this threat generally increases as the degree of observer participation increases. Secondly, participant observers may unduly influence the individuals whose behavior they are recording. This effect is not easily assessed, however, it generally more prominent when the group being observed is small, or if the activities of the participant observer are prominent. Lastly, disguised observation raises some ethical issues regarding obtaining information without respondents' knowledge. For example, the observations collected by an observer participating in an internet chat room discussing how racists advocate racial violence may be seen as incriminating evidence collected without the respondents\u2019 knowledge. The dilemma here is of course that if informed consent were obtained from participants, respondents would likely choose not to cooperate.\nSection::::Direct observational methods.:Observation with intervention.:Structured observation.\nStructured observation represents a compromise between the passive nonintervention of naturalistic observation, and the systematic manipulation of independent variables and precise control characterized by lab experiments. Structured observation may occur in a natural or laboratory setting. Within structured observation, often the observer intervenes in order to cause an event to occur, or to \u201cset up\u201d a situation so that events can be more easily recorded than they would be without intervention. Such a situation often makes use of a confederate who creates a situation for observing behavior. Structured observation is frequently employed by clinical and developmental psychologists, or for studying animals in the wild. \nOne benefit to structured observation is that it allows researchers to record behaviors that may be difficult to observe using naturalistic observation, but that are more natural than the artificial conditions imposed in a lab. However, problems in interpreting structured observations can occur when the same observation procedures are not followed across observations or observers, or when important variables are not controlled across observations.\nSection::::Direct observational methods.:Observation with intervention.:Field experiments.\nIn field experiments, researchers manipulate one or more independent variables in a natural setting to determine the effect on behavior. This method represents the most extreme form of intervention in observational methods, and researchers are able to exert more control over the study and its participants. Conducting field experiments allows researchers to make causal inferences from their results, and therefore increases external validity. However, confounding may decrease internal validity of a study, and ethical issues may arise in studies involving high-risk.\nFor a great example of a field experiment study, see this study by Milgram, Liberty, Toledo, and Wackenhut exploring the relation between the unique spatial configuration of the queue and the means by which its integrity is defended. as well as one who predict the future.\nSection::::Indirect observational methods.\nIndirect observation can be used if one wishes to be entirely unobtrusive in their observation method. This can often be useful if a researcher is approaching a particularly sensitive topic that would be likely to elicit reactivity in the subject. There are also potential ethical concerns that are avoided by using the indirect observational method.\nSection::::Indirect observational methods.:Physical trace evidence.\nThe investigation of physical trace evidence involves examining the remnants of the subject's past behavior. These remnants could be any"]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

GOAL agents derive their choice of action from their beliefs and goals. The language provides the basic building blocks to design and implement cognitive agents by programming constructs that allow and facilitate the manipulation of an agent's beliefs and goals and to structure its decision-making. The language provides an intuitive programming framework based on common sense or practical reasoning.\n\nBULLET::::- Declarative beliefs: Agents use a symbolic, logical language to represent the information they have, and their beliefs or knowledge about the environment they act upon in order to achieve their goals. This \"knowledge representation language\" is not fixed by GOAL but, in principle, may be varied according to the needs of the programmer.\nBULLET::::- Declarative goals: Agents may have multiple goals that specify \"what\" the agent wants to achieve at some moment in the near or distant future. Declarative goals specify a state of the environment that the agent wants to establish, they do not specify actions or procedures how to achieve such states.\nBULLET::::- Blind commitment strategy: Agents commit to their goals and drop goals only when they have been achieved. This commitment strategy, called a \"blind\" commitment strategy in the literature, is the \"default\" strategy used by GOAL agents. Cognitive agents are assumed to not have goals that they believe are already achieved, a constraint which has been built into GOAL agents by dropping a goal when it has been \"completely\" achieved.\nBULLET::::- Rule-based action selection: Agents use so-called \"action rules\" to select actions, given their beliefs and goals. Such rules may \"underspecify\" the choice of action in the sense that multiple actions may be performed at any time given the action rules of the agent. In that case, a GOAL agent will select an arbitrary enabled action for execution.\nBULLET::::- Policy-based intention modules: Agents may focus their attention and put all their efforts on achieving a subset of their goals, using a subset of their actions, using only knowledge relevant to achieving those goals. GOAL provides modules to structure action rules and knowledge dedicated to achieving specific goals. Informally, modules can be viewed as policy-based intentions in the sense of Michael Bratman.\nBULLET::::- Communication at the knowledge level: Agents may communicate with each other to exchange information, and to coordinate their actions.

Hence, the product owner is accountable for the product backlog and for maximizing the value that the team delivers. The product owner defines the product in customer-centric terms (typically user stories), adds them to the product backlog, and prioritizes them based on importance and dependencies. A scrum team should have only one product owner (although a product owner could support more than one team) This role should not be combined with that of the scrum master. The product owner should focus on the business side of product development and spend the majority of their time liaising with stakeholders and the engineers which are part of their Team. The product owner should not dictate how the team reaches a technical solution, but rather will seek consensus among the team members. This role is crucial and requires a deep understanding of both sides: the business and the engineers (developers) in the scrum team. Therefore a good product owner should be able to communicate what the business needs, ask why they need it (because there may be better ways to achieve that), and convey the message to all stakeholders including the delivery Team using a technical language, as required. The role is crucial because the product owner needs to be technical enough to understand the architecture of the solution in order to be credible by the Team.\nCommunication is a core responsibility of the product owner. The ability to convey priorities and empathize with team members and stakeholders is vital to steer product development in the right direction. The product owner role bridges the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, serving as a proxy for stakeholders to the team and as a team representative to the overall stakeholder community.\nAs the face of the team to the stakeholders, the following are some of the communication tasks of the product owner to the stakeholders:\nBULLET::::- Define and announce releases.\nBULLET::::- Communicate delivery and team status.\nBULLET::::- Share progress during governance meetings.\nBULLET::::- Share significant RIDAs (risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions) with stakeholders.\nBULLET::::- Negotiate priorities, scope, funding, and schedule.\nBULLET::::- Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent and clear.\nEmpathy is a key attribute for a product owner to have\u2014the ability to put one's self in another's shoes. A product owner converses with different stakeholders, who have a variety of backgrounds, job roles, and objectives. A product owner must be able to see from these different points of view. To be effective, it is wise for a product owner to know the level of detail the audience needs. The development team needs thorough feedback and specifications so they can build a product up to expectation, while an executive sponsor may just need summaries of progress. Providing more information than necessary may lose stakeholder interest and waste time. A direct means of communication is the most preferred by seasoned agile product owners.\nA product owner's ability to communicate effectively is also enhanced by being skilled in techniques that identify stakeholder needs, negotiate priorities between stakeholder interests, and collaborate with developers to ensure effective implementation of requirements.\nSection::::Roles.:Development team.\nThe development team is responsible for delivering potentially releasable product increments every sprint. \nThe team has from three to nine members who carry out all tasks required to build the product increments (analysis, design, development, testing, technical writing, etc.). Although there will be several disciplines represented in the team, its members are referred to generically as \"developers\". In Agile literature, particularly, this term refers to anyone who plays a role in the development of the solution or the end product and can include analysts, solution engineers, user interface designers, programmers, and testers, among others. To avoid potential confusion that this only refers to programmers, some organizations call this a \"delivery team\" and its members just \"team members\".\nThe development team in Scrum is self-organizing. While no work should come to the team, except through the product owner, and the scrum master is expected to protect the team from too much distraction,"], "wikipedia-31721134": ["Business requirements are typically defined by business analysts in collaboration with other project stakeholders.\nBoth parties may be responsible for determining the business requirements and developing technical solutions.

Other responsibilities range from client relations to zoning and building code management, material specifications, maintaining quality control by checking and making revisions to shop drawings.\nThe project architect can also assume the role of the project manager (PM) in a small studio, but typically, the project architect is only responsible for the design management of a building project, assisted by interns and other staff. A project architect is required to be registered as an architect in the state in which they are performing the role. Intern architects may perform the role under the supervision of a registered architect but may not sign or seal legal documents. The project architect may, but does not often, sign contracts, or seal construction documents or payment applications, which are most often legally signed and sealed by a state registered owner or partner of the architectural office.

Architects use many different passive and active techniques to reduce the energy needs of buildings and increase their ability to capture or generate their own energy. One of the keys to exploit local environmental resources and influence energy-related factors such as daylight, solar heat gains and ventilation is the use of site analysis.\n\nNumerous passive architectural strategies have been developed over time. Examples of such strategies include the arrangement of rooms or the sizing and orientation of windows in a building, and the orientation of facades and streets or the ratio between building heights and street widths for urban planning.\n\nAn important and cost-effective element of an efficient heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is a well-insulated building. A more efficient building requires less heat generating or dissipating power, but may require more ventilation capacity to expel polluted indoor air.\n\nSignificant amounts of energy are flushed out of buildings in the water, air and compost streams. Off the shelf, on-site energy recycling technologies can effectively recapture energy from waste hot water and stale air and transfer that energy into incoming fresh cold water or fresh air. Recapture of energy for uses other than gardening from compost leaving buildings requires centralized anaerobic digesters.\n\nHVAC systems are powered by motors. Copper, versus other metal conductors, helps to improve the electrical energy efficiencies of motors, thereby enhancing the sustainability of electrical building components. \n\nSite and building orientation have some major effects on a building's HVAC efficiency.\n\nPassive solar building design allows buildings to harness the energy of the sun efficiently without the use of any active solar mechanisms such as photovoltaic cells or solar hot water panels. Typically passive solar building designs incorporate materials with high thermal mass that retain heat effectively and strong insulation that works to prevent heat escape. Low energy designs also requires the use of solar shading, by means of awnings, blinds or shutters, to relieve the solar heat gain in summer and to reduce the need for artificial cooling. In addition, low energy buildings typically have a very low surface area to volume ratio to minimize heat loss. This means that sprawling multi-winged building designs (often thought to look more \"organic\") are often avoided in favor of more centralized structures. Traditional cold climate buildings such as American colonial saltbox designs provide a good historical model for centralized heat efficiency in a small-scale building.\n\nWindows are placed to maximize the input of heat-creating light while minimizing the loss of heat through glass, a poor insulator. In the northern hemisphere this usually involves installing a large number of south-facing windows to collect direct sun and severely restricting the number of north-facing windows. Certain window types, such as double or triple glazed insulated windows with gas filled spaces and low emissivity (low-E) coatings, provide much better insulation than single-pane glass windows. Preventing excess solar gain by means of solar shading devices in the summer months is important to reduce cooling needs. Deciduous trees are often planted in front of windows to block excessive sun in summer with their leaves but allow light through in winter when their leaves fall off. Louvers or light shelves are installed to allow the sunlight in during the winter (when the sun is lower in the sky) and keep it out in the summer (when the sun is high in the sky). Coniferous or evergreen plants are often planted to the north of buildings to shield against cold north winds.\n\nIn colder climates, heating systems are a primary focus for sustainable architecture because they are typically one of the largest single energy drains in buildings.\n\nIn warmer climates where cooling is a primary concern, passive solar designs can also be very effective. Masonry building materials with high thermal mass are very valuable for retaining the cool temperatures of night throughout the day. In addition builders often opt for sprawling single story structures in order to maximize surface area and heat loss. Buildings are often designed to capture and channel existing winds, particularly the especially cool winds coming from nearby bodies of water. Many of these valuable strategies are employed in some way by the traditional architecture of warm regions, such as south-western mission buildings.\n\nIn climates with four seasons, an integrated energy system will increase in efficiency: when the building is well insulated, when it is sited to work with the forces of nature, when heat is recaptured (to be used immediately or stored), when the heat plant relying on fossil fuels or electricity is greater than 100% efficient, and when renewable energy is used."], "wikipedia-28730644": ["BULLET::::- Energy efficiency: use manufacturing processes and produce products which require less energy\nBULLET::::- Design for reuse and recycling: \"Products, processes, and systems should be designed for performance in a commercial 'afterlife'.\"\nBULLET::::- Targeted durability, not immortality, should be a design goal.\nBULLET::::- Material diversity in multicomponent products should be minimized to promote disassembly and value retention.\nBULLET::::- Design impact measures for total carbon footprint and life-cycle assessment for any resource used are increasingly required and available.^ Many are complex, but some give quick and accurate whole-earth estimates of impacts.

That is the cheapest way to minimise energy consumption and in the future it will be essential. Sustainability requirements are becoming stricter and these challenges cannot be met by means of technology alone.\nKongebro's work has revealed that 40 percent of a building's energy consumption depends on design.

From a distance, the city looks like a cube. The temperature in the streets is generally cooler than the surrounding desert. The temperature difference is due to Masdar's unique construction. A wind tower modelled on traditional Arab designs sucks air from above and pushes a cooling breeze through Masdar's streets. The site is raised above the surrounding land to create a slight cooling effect. Buildings are clustered close together to create streets and walkways shielded from the sun.\n\nMasdar City was designed by Foster and Partners. Foster's design team started its work by touring ancient cities such as Cairo and Muscat to see how they kept cool. Foster found that these cities coped with hot desert temperatures through shorter, narrower streets usually no longer than . The buildings at the end of these streets create just enough wind turbulence to push air upwards, creating a flushing effect that cools the street.\n\nThe absence of motor vehicles coupled with Masdar's perimeter wall, designed to keep out the hot desert winds, allows for narrow and shaded streets that help funnel cooler breezes across the city.\n\nThe Masdar Institute's building, developed in co-operation with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, uses 51% less electricity and 54% less potable water than traditional buildings in the UAE, and is fitted with a metering system that constantly observes power consumption.\n\nThe Siemens headquarters won an award for best office building at the Mpim Architectural Review Future Projects Awards in 2012. The Middle East Architect Awards named it both the best and most sustainable office building the same year.\n\nThe building is built around the idea of a \"box within a box\". The structure includes a highly insulated airtight inner fa\u00e7ade that insulates from the sun and a lightweight aluminium shading system on the exterior. The plaza beneath the building is funnel-shaped. This shape works to suck prevailing winds underneath the building. Due to the Venturi effect, a breeze flows up to the roof of the building through atria in the buildings structure, cooling public spaces without energy costs. These atria also allow daylight into the centre of the building in order to reduce the need for artificial lighting, further reducing energy consumption. The buildings automation systems are all from Siemens.\n\nThere are no light switches or water taps in the city; movement sensors control lighting and water to cut electricity and water consumption by 51 and 55 percent respectively."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Lighting design in healthcare environments is a major factor in creating healing situations. Since the design of healthcare environments is said to influence patient's outcomes, yet high costs prevent most hospitals from renovating or rebuilding, changes in lighting becomes a cost-effective way to improve existing environments. It is proven that people who are surrounded by natural light are more productive and live healthier lives. When patients are sick, and surrounded by medical equipment and white walls, the last thing they need is a dark, stuffy room. This is why it is important for every room to have a window for natural light to come into and help create a healing environment for the patient.\n\nThe Auditory Environment While so much of the patient's experience is based on visual cues, the majority of meaning of their experience is auditory. The many sounds of a hospital are foreign to their experience and their line of sight is limited. Nightingale claimed that sounds that create \"anticipation, expectation, waiting, and fear of surprise ...damage the patient.\"(). Add to the perception and meaning attribute to any sound the factors of age-related hearing impairment common to older patients, heavy medication, pain, and other conditions, cognition is impacted as is the ability to understand language. Hospital noise, at any volume level, is credited with being the primary cause of sleep deprivation, a contributing factor in delirium, and a risk factor for errors. The current pressure to reduce noise at night has been mistakenly understood to mean undue quiet at night when patients most need cues that people are around them and available if they need help. Just s lighting must be designed to serve both day and night, so much the auditory environment be designed to support activity,cognition, rest, and sleep."], "wikipedia-16721822": ["An interstitial space is an intermediate space located between regular-use floors, commonly located in hospitals and laboratory-type buildings to allow space for the mechanical systems of the building. By providing this space, laboratory and hospital rooms may be easily rearranged throughout their lifecycles and therefore reduce lifecycle cost.\n\nIf changes or maintenance need to be performed in the interstitial space, the primary space does not need to be shut down, which is important in buildings like hospitals where the equipment in the space must operate constantly. Unlike traditionally built buildings, where the mechanical space is located in the basement or on the top floor, the interstitial space needs few vertical penetrations and therefore leaves more open space on the primary floor. The entire floor plan of these buildings can be more open because there are fewer fixed vertical penetrations through the floor and walls.\n\nInterstitial spaces are exceedingly useful when a building needs to be re-modeled. In a medical or lab facility, technology improves incredibly fast and no one can predict what equipment buildings will need to be designed for in the future. With an interstitial space, room layouts in the primary floor may be altered much more easily than traditionally designed buildings since there are fewer service stacks penetrating the floors. The walls can be arranged and rearranged freely. If a drastic renovation must occur, only one floor at a time has to be shut down for renovation, instead of the whole building.

Positive feelings such as calmness increase, while anxiety, anger, or other negative emotions diminish with views of nature. In contrast there is also convincing evidence that stress could be worsened and ineffective in fostering restoration in built environments that lack nature. Few studies have shown the restorative effects of gardens for stressed patients, families and staff.

This document should be prepared at different levels of granularity, how detailed the documentation is at each stage depends on the complexity of the project and on the procurement route chosen for the project.\nThe SoRs represent a very important part of a continuous process of communication between clients (demand) and their project team (supply), they will be updated and managed using computerized tools and will contain all requirements throughout the life of the facility.

In such projects, workshops are often employed with project participants: owners, users, customers, facility experts, builders/contractors and other designers brought together for an intensive one- or two-day period to devise the critical aspects of the brief.\nIf the brief will provide a large number of similar spaces, for example, in a hospital, then room/space 'types' might be defined, as a type of 'space dictionary' that is then used to inform room or space groupings. These space groupings are then assembled into related sets of rooms to meet a functional or service requirement. The critical component of the related sets is that the interactions between rooms are set out, with details as to the type of interaction. For example, if escorted patients, beds and medical equipment are to be moved, or if individuals or groups of people will move between spaces, the architect's design will need to acknowledge the different design responses to be made.\nThe information used to assemble a 'space dictionary' can be quite detailed, with a schedule produced that lists, for each room, parameters, the requirement against the parameter, and any particular performance needs.\nParameters might include: population (median and peak), area, minimum height, floor loading, floor finish and skirting requirements, including any plinths, hobs or set-downs, wall finishes, including wall protection needs (pertinent in hospitals, warehouses, etc.), ceiling finish, including acoustic needs, engineering services required: power, lighting, air-conditioning, water, drainage, communications, etc.; environmental conditions: air temperature, humidity, noise level, air movement; access and security needs; FFE (furniture, fittings and equipment), with note made of mass, dimensions, power requirements, energy evolved, noise produced, ventilation and extraction needed, service and operating clearances; fire safety.\nA thorough brief will start with a definition of the services or functions to be accommodated, decomposing these functions into specific sub-functions and then to activities. A 'functional brief' is thus compiled. This brief is used to, in turn, create the architectural brief, that sets out the accommodation specifics for preparation of design options.\nSection::::Evaluation.\nFor critical facilities, the project manager or owner may require the architect to validate the design against the brief, producing a report that shows in tabular form, how and where, the design meets the brief.

This is in contrast to traditional prescribed building codes, which mandate specific construction practises, such as stud size and distance between studs in wooden frame construction.

When a large part of the development team has been outsourced, the costs will start to add up quickly and are very visible if contracted on a time and materials basis (T&M). Fixed price contracts with external parties limit this risk. For internal resources, the costs of delays are not as readily apparent, unless time spent by resources is being tracked against the project, as labor costs are essentially \u2018fixed\u2019 costs.\nBULLET::::- Opportunity costs \u2013 Opportunity costs come in two types \u2013 lost revenue and unrealized expense reductions. Some projects are specifically undertaken with the purpose of driving new or additional revenues to the bottom line. For every month of delay, a company foregoes a month of this new revenue stream. The purpose of other projects is to improve efficiencies and reduce costs. Again, each month of failure postpones the realization of these expense reductions by another month. In the vast majority of cases, these opportunities are never captured or analyzed, resulting in misleading ROI calculations. Of the two opportunity costs, the lost revenue is the most egregious \u2013 and the effects are greater and longer lasting.\nOn a lot of projects (particularly larger ones) the project manager is the one responsible for ensuring that a project is completed on time. The BA's job is more to ensure that if a project is not completed on time then at least the highest priority requirements are met.\nSection::::Goals.:Document the right requirements.\nBusiness analysts want to make sure that they define the requirements in a way that meets the business needs, for example, in IT applications the requirements need to meet end-users' needs. Essentially, they want to define the right application. This means that they must document the right requirements through listening carefully to \u2018customer\u2019 feedback, and by delivering a complete set of clear requirements to the technical architects and coders who will write the program. If a business analyst has limited tools or skills to help him elicit the right requirements, then the chances are fairly high that he will end up documenting requirements that will not be used or that will need to be re-written \u2013 resulting in rework as discussed below. The time wasted to document unnecessary requirements not only impacts the business analyst, it also impacts the rest of the development cycle. Coders need to generate application code to perform these unnecessary requirements and testers need to make sure that the wanted features actually work as documented and coded. Experts estimate that 10% to 40% of the features in new software applications are unnecessary or go unused. Being able to reduce the amount of these extra features by even one-third can result in significant savings. An approach of minimalism or \"Keep it Simple\" and minimum technology supports a reduced cost number for the end result and on going maintenance of the implemented solution.\nSection::::Goals.:Improve project efficiency.\nEfficiency can be achieved in two ways: by reducing rework and by shortening project length.\nRework is a common industry headache and it has become so common at many organizations that it is often built into project budgets and time lines. It generally refers to extra work needed in a project to fix errors due to incomplete or missing requirements and can impact the entire software development process from definition to coding and testing. The need for rework can be reduced by ensuring that the requirements gathering and definition processes are thorough and by ensuring that the business and technical members of a project are involved in these processes from an early stage.\nShortening project length presents two potential benefits. For every month that a project can be shortened, project resource costs can be diverted to other projects. This can lead to savings on the current project and lead to earlier start times of future projects (thus increasing revenue potential)."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

Industrial designers, manufacturers, and engineers use Digital Prototyping to design, iterate, optimize, validate, and visualize their products digitally throughout the product development process. Innovative digital prototypes can be created via CAutoD through intelligent and near-optimal iterations, meeting multiple design objectives (such as maximised output, energy efficiency, highest speed and cost-effectiveness), identifying multiple figures of merit, and reducing development gearing and time-to-market. Marketers also use Digital Prototyping to create photorealistic renderings and animations of products prior to manufacturing. Companies often adopt Digital Prototyping with the goal of improving communication between product development stakeholders, getting products to market faster, and facilitating product innovation.\nDigital Prototyping goes beyond simply creating product designs in 3D. It gives product development teams a way to assess the operation of moving parts, to determine whether or not the product will fail, and see how the various product components interact with subsystems\u2014either pneumatic or electric. By simulating and validating the real-world performance of a product design digitally, manufacturers often can reduce the number of physical prototypes they need to create before a product can be manufactured, reducing the cost and time needed for physical prototyping. Many companies use Digital Prototyping in place of, or as a complement to, physical prototyping.\nDigital Prototyping changes the traditional product development cycle from designbuildtestfix to designanalyzetestbuild. Instead of needing to build multiple physical prototypes and then testing them to see if they'll work, companies can conduct testing digitally throughout the process by using Digital Prototyping, reducing the number of physical prototypes needed to validate the design. Studies show that by using Digital Prototyping to catch design problems up front, manufacturers experience fewer change orders downstream. Because the geometry in digital prototypes is highly accurate, companies can check interferences to avoid assembly issues that generate change orders in the testing and manufacturing phases of development. Companies can also perform simulations in early stages of the product development cycle, so they avoid failure modes during testing or manufacturing phases. With a Digital Prototyping approach, companies can digitally test a broader range of their product's performance. They can also test design iterations quickly to assess whether they're over- or under-designing components.\nResearch from the Aberdeen Group shows that manufacturers that use Digital Prototyping build half the number of physical prototypes as the average manufacturer, get to market 58 days faster than average, and experience 48 percent lower prototyping costs."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Attending to the technical dimension of artifacts, for example, by applied scientists, mechanical or electronic engineers, and experts in economics, production, and marketing, is called technology-centered design.

For most people, the operations inside a computer are incomprehensible, but far from troubling because computers are designed to be experienced primarily through their interfaces. Human-computer interfaces consist of interactively rearrangeable icons, texts, and controls that users can understand in everyday terms and manipulate towards desirable ends.

Although an automobile should obviously function as a means of transportation, human-centered designers emphasize the experiences of driving, ease of operation, feeling of safety, including the social meanings of driving a particular automobile.

It is primarily an exchange of mutual stress, whereby the movement of the ground-structure system is influenced by both the type of ground and the type of structure. This is especially applicable to areas of seismic activity. Various combinations of soil and structure can either amplify or diminish movement and subsequent damage. A building on stiff ground rather than deformable ground will tend to suffer greater damage. A second interaction effect, tied to mechanical properties of soil, is the sinking of foundations, worsened by a seismic event. This phenomenon is called soil liquefaction.\n\nThe type of foundations is selected according to the type of ground; for instance, in the case of homogeneous rock formations connected plinths are selected, while in the case of very low quality grounds plates are chosen.\n\nBoth grounds and structures can be more or less deformable; their combination can or cannot cause the amplification of the seismic effects on the structure.\n\nGround, in fact, is a filter with respect to all the main seismic waves, as stiffer soil fosters high-frequency seismic waves while less compact soil accommodates lower frequency waves. Therefore, a stiff building, characterized by a high fundamental frequency, suffers amplified damage when built on stiff ground and then subjected to higher frequencies.\n\nFor instance, suppose there are two buildings that share the same high stiffness. They stand on two different soil types: the first, stiff and rocky\u2014the second, sandy and deformable. If subjected to the same seismic event, the building on the stiff ground suffers greater damage.\n\nThe second interaction effect, tied to mechanical properties of soil, is about the lowering (sinking) of foundations, worsened by the seismic event itself, especially about less compact grounds. This phenomenon is called soil liquefaction.\n\nThe methods most used to mitigate the problem of the ground-structure interaction consist of the employment of the before-seen isolation systems and of some ground brace techniques, which are adopted above all on the low-quality ones (categories D and E).\n\nThe most diffused techniques are the jet grouting technique and the pile work technique.\n\nThe jet-grouting technique consists of injecting in the subsoil some liquid concrete by means of a drill. When this concrete hardens it forms a sort of column that consolidates the surrounding soil. This process is repeated on all areas of the structure.\n\nThe pile work technique consists of using piles, which, once inserted in the ground, support the foundation and the building above, by moving the loads or the weights towards soil layers that are deeper and therefore more compact and movement-resistant."], "wikipedia-42186289": ["Parametric design is a process based on algorithmic thinking that enables the expression of parameters and rules that, together, define, encode and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response.\nParametric design is a paradigm in design where the relationship between elements is used to manipulate and inform the design of complex geometries and structures.\nThe term \"parametric\" originates from mathematics (parametric equation) and refers to the use of certain parameters or variables that can be edited to manipulate or alter the end result of an equation or system.

By adjusting the position of the weights or the length of the strings he could alter the shape of each arch and also see how this change influenced the arches connected to it. He placed a mirror on the bottom of the model to see how it should look upside-down.\nSection::::History (early examples).:Analogue parametric design.:Features of Gaudi's method.\nGaudi's analogue method includes the main features of a computational of a parametric model (input parameters, equation, output):\nBULLET::::- The string length, birdshot weight and anchor point location all form independent input parameters\nBULLET::::- The vertex locations of the points on the strings being the outcomes of the model\nBULLET::::- The outcomes are derived by explicit functions, in this case gravity or Newtons law of motion.\nBy modifying individual parameters of these models Gaudi could generate different versions of his model while being certain the resulting structure would stand in pure compression.\nInstead of having to manually calculate the results of parametric equations he could automatically derive the shape of the catenary curves through the force of gravity acting on the strings.\nSection::::History (early examples).:Sketchpad.\nWhere Gaudi used physical laws to speed up his calculation of parametric equations, Ivan Sutherland looked to the processing power of digital computers.\nSutherland created an interactive computer-aided design program called Sketchpad. Using a light pen, users could draw lines and arcs that could be related to each other using constraints. These constraints contained all the essential properties of parametric equations. Users could experiment and explore different designs by altering the parameters of an entity and let Sketchpad do the calculations and redraw the geometry according to the constraints imposed upon it.\nSection::::Architecture.\nNature has always served as inspiration for architects and designers. Computer technology has given designers and architects the tools to analyse and simulate the complexity observed in nature and apply it to structural building shapes and urban organizational patterns. In the 1980s architects and designers started using computers running software developed for the aerospace and moving picture industries to \"animate form\".\nOne of the first architects and theorists that used computers to generate architecture was Greg Lynn. His blob and fold architecture is some of the early examples of computer generated architecture. Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport's new Terminal 3, finished in 2013, designed by Italian architect Massimiliano Fuksas, with parametric design support by the engineering firm Knippers Helbig, is an example for the use of parametric design and production technologies in a large scale building.\nSection::::Urban design.\nParametric urbanism is concerned with the study and prediction of settlement patterns. Architect Frei Otto distinguishes occupying and connecting as the two fundamental processes that are in involved with all urbanisation. Studies look at producing solutions that reduce overall path length in systems while maintaining low average detour factor or facade differentiation."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

These areas are studied in terms of physical principles, relationship to building occupant health, comfort, and productivity, and how they can be controlled by the building envelope and electrical and mechanical systems.\n\nThe practical purpose of building science is to provide predictive capability to optimize the building performance and sustainability of new and existing buildings, understand or prevent building failures, and guide the design of new techniques and technologies.\n\nIndoor environmental quality (IEQ) refers to the quality of a building's environment in relation to the health and wellbeing of those who occupy space within it. IEQ is determined by many factors, including lighting, air quality, and damp conditions. Workers are often concerned that they have symptoms or health conditions from exposures to contaminants in the buildings where they work. One reason for this concern is that their symptoms often get better when they are not in the building. While research has shown that some respiratory symptoms and illnesses can be associated with damp buildings, it is still unclear what measurements of indoor contaminants show that workers are at risk for disease. In most instances where a worker and his or her physician suspect that the building environment is causing a specific health condition, the information available from medical tests and tests of the environment is not sufficient to establish which contaminants are responsible. Despite uncertainty about what to measure and how to interpret what is measured, research shows that building-related symptoms are associated with building characteristics, including dampness, cleanliness, and ventilation characteristics.\n\nIndoor environments are highly complex and building occupants may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the form of gases and particles) from office machines, cleaning products, construction activities, carpets and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals respond to the indoor environment.\n\nUnderstanding the sources of indoor environmental contaminants and controlling them can often help prevent or resolve building-related worker symptoms. Practical guidance for improving and maintaining the indoor environment is available.\n\nBuilding indoor environment covers the environmental aspects in the design, analysis, and operation of energy-efficient, healthy, and comfortable buildings. Fields of specialization include architecture, HVAC design, thermal comfort, indoor air quality (IAQ), lighting, acoustics, and control systems.\n\nThe mechanical systems, usually a sub-set of the broader Building Services, used to control the temperature, humidity, pressure and other select aspects of the indoor environment are often described as the Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems.\n\nThese systems have grown in complexity and importance (often consuming around 20% of the total budget in commercial buildings) as occupants demand tighter control of conditions, buildings become larger, and enclosures and passive measures became less important as a means of providing comfort.\n\nBuilding science includes the analysis of HVAC systems for both physical impacts (heat distribution, air velocities, relative humidities, etc.) and for effect on the comfort of the building's occupants. Because occupants' perceived comfort is dependent on factors such as current weather and the type of climate the building is located in, the needs for HVAC systems to provide comfortable conditions will vary across projects.\n\nThe building enclosure is the part of the building that separates the indoors from the outdoors. This includes the wall, roof, windows, slabs on grade, and joints between all of these. The comfort, productivity, and even health of building occupants in areas near the building enclosure (i.e., perimeter zones) are affected by outdoor influences such as noise, temperature, and solar radiation, and by their ability to control these influences. As part of its function, the enclosure must control (not necessarily block or stop) the flow of heat, air, vapor, solar radiation, insects, noise, etc.\n\nPart of building science is the attempt to design buildings with consideration for the future and the resources and realities of tomorrow.

As a result, the layout of building occupant workstations is likely to influence energy consumption. In this paper, we introduce methods for relating lighting zone energy to zone-level occupant dynamics, simulating energy consumption of a lighting system based on this relationship, and optimizing the layout of buildings through the use of both a clustering-based approach and a genetic algorithm in order to reduce energy consumption. We find in a case study that nonhomogeneous behavior (i.e., high diversity) among occupant schedules positively correlates with the energy consumption of a highly controllable lighting system. We additionally find through data-driven simulation that the na\"ive clustering-based optimization and the genetic algorithm (which makes use of the energy simulation engine) produce layouts that reduce energy consumption by roughly 5% compared to the existing layout of a real office space comprised of 165 occupants. Overall, this study demonstrates the merits of utilizing low-cost dynamic design of existing building layouts as a means to reduce energy usage.

The most common cancers were skin cancer and prostate cancer. The dust from the collapsed towers was 'wildly toxic', according to air pollution expert and University of California Davis Professor Emeritus Thomas Cahill. Much of the thousands of tons of debris resulting from the collapse of the Twin Towers was pulverized concrete, which is known to cause silicosis upon inhalation. The remainder consisted of more than 2,500 contaminants, more specifically: 50% non-fibrous material and construction debris; 40% glass and other fibers; 9.2% cellulose; and 0.8% of the extremely toxic carcinogen asbestos, as well as detectable amounts of lead and mercury. There were also unprecedented levels of dioxins and PAHs from the fires which burned for three months. Many of the dispersed substances (asbestos, crystalline silica, lead, cadmium, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) are carcinogenic; other substances can trigger kidney, heart, liver and nervous system deterioration. A study of 5,000 rescue workers published in April 2010 by Dr. David J. Prezant the chief medical officer for the Office of Medical Affairs at the New York City Fire Department found that all the workers studied had impaired lung functions with an average impairment of 10 percent. The study found the impairments presented itself in the first year of after the attack with little or no improvements in the ensuing six years. 30 to 40 percent of workers were reporting persistent symptoms and 1000 of the group studied were on 'permanent respiratory disability.'"], "wikipedia-33827504": ["Housing quality and health outcomes in the United States are inextricably linked.

Again, the lack of commonplace appliances like a furnace or sink can expose inhabitants to diseases and injury.\n\nMaintenance and upkeep of public and low-income housing remains a major issue, leading to chronic problems of water infiltration, pest infestation and unsafe physical conditions. The disproportionate burden of these problems falls to children, the elderly and those with chronic illnesses, and minorities.\n\nNeighborhoods that are seen as bad or deteriorating are often characterized by the conditions of the housing in that neighborhood. Poor neighborhood conditions can be defined as having abandoned buildings, vacant lots, no access to quality schools, and high levels of poverty. These neighborhood dynamics can contribute to a person's psychological and social stress.\n\nIn low-income neighborhoods crime and noxious noise and odors can force individuals to isolate in substandard homes, which often characterize low-income neighborhoods. The combination of avoiding outside activity and isolating in dangerous living spaces leads to negative health outcomes such as obesity, lead poisoning, and asthma.\n\nAsthma is a major reason for childhood hospitalizations as well as absenteeism from schools. Asthmatic children living in homes with cockroaches, mice and mold may be especially prone to episodes requiring medical care. Direct health care costs of asthma totaled more than $14.7 billion in 2008. $5 billion annually in indirect costs, primarily from lost productivity, can be added to the total. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost 13 million lost school days, 4 million asthma attacks and nearly 4,000 deaths yearly are associated with asthma. Water infiltration and poor ventilation increases the likelihood that moisture will be an issue in a home, which can lead to infestation of pests and to mold growth, known triggers of allergies and asthma.\n\nHigh lead levels (blood levels \u226510 micrograms per deciliter) are associated with a number of poor health outcomes, including: learning disabilities, behavioral and neurological problems, and, in severe cases, death. Even relatively low blood lead levels can have negative health impacts. The impact on the individual and on society in terms of lost potential can be dramatic. Those living in older, poorly maintained housing are at the greatest risk, and many of these housing units are home to low-income families Even though blood levels are dropping in much of the population in the United States, the poorest children remain at the greatest risk because they are most likely to live in older, poorly maintained housing.\n\nUnintentional injury is the leading cause of death among children under the age of 15. Deaths from residential injuries accounted for an average of 2,822 deaths annually from 1985-1997. The rates of death associated with residential injury are equally significant amongst those aged 65 and older. Poorly maintained stairs, sidewalks, bad lighting, and inadequate facilities for people with limited mobility or sensory impairments are all implicated in injury rates.\n\nEven after accounting for other potential contributors like income, smoking or employment status, poor housing conditions are associated with an increased risk of chronic respiratory infection. Unsanitary conditions made more severe by aging and poorly constructed structures, exacerbate the problem. Poor heating and cooling lead to an increased risk of temperature related illnesses. Heat stroke and exhaustion are a major cause of mortality and morbidity, especially for the elderly. Conversely, exposure to cold temperatures can contribute to an increased use of health services.\n\n\u201cFood deserts\u201d, areas that lack grocery stores or markets that contain healthful foods like fruits and vegetables, are primarily found in high poverty, inner-city areas where residents lack the resources to travel.

A lack of adequate play areas for children, poor lighting or sidewalk condition can also lead to a lack of physical activity which is associated with increased obesity and associated morbidities, such as type II diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease.\n\nNeighborhoods of low socioeconomic status are associated with higher rates of intentional injuries (violent crime). Poor investment in community property, and the lack of private and semi-private space can lead to the inability of residents to properly or adequately maintain defensible space. A lack of \u201ceyes of the street\u201d due to poor design or poor maintenance only makes crime prevention more difficult.\n\nMost significant aspects of poor housing are linked to various adverse health effects ranked by highest number of people affected.

This project saw 700 dwellings built to high efficiency standards. The results of this project show a significant gap between the energy used expected before construction and the actual energy use once the house is occupied. The workmanship is analysed in this work. The authors emphasise the importance of thermal bridges that were not considered for the calculations, and how those originated by the internal partitions that separate dwellings have the largest impact on the final energy use. The dwellings that were monitored in use in this study show a large difference between the real energy use and that estimated using SAP, with one of them giving +176% of the expected value when in use.\nHopfe has published several papers concerning uncertainties in building design that cover workmanship. A more recent publication at the time of writing looks into uncertainties of group 2 and 3. In this work the uncertainties are defined as normal distributions. The random parameters are sampled to generate 200 tests that are sent to the simulator (VA114), the results from which will be analysed to check the uncertainties with the largest impact on the energy calculations. This work showed that the uncertainty in the value used for infiltration is the factor that is likely to have the largest influence on cooling and heating demands.\nSection::::Classification of factors that contribute to the performance gap.:Type 3: Occupants.\nThe work of Schnieders and Hermelink showed a substantial variability in the energy demands of low-energy buildings designed under the same specification (Passivhaus). Although the passivhaus standard has a very controlled, high quality workmanship, large differences have been seen in energy demand in different houses.\nBlight and Coley showed that that variability can be occasioned due to variance in occupant behaviour (it should be noted that the use of windows and doors was included in this work). The work of Blight and Coley proves two things: (1) Occupants have a substantial influence on energy use; and (2) The model they used to generate occupants\u2019 behaviour is accurate for the creation of behavioural patterns of inhabitants.\nThe availability of this tool allows scientist\u2019s to model the uncertainty of occupants\u2019 behaviour as a set of behavioural patterns that have been proven to correlate with real occupants\u2019 behaviour."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The subjects trained 15 to 20 minutes per day at 3 to 4 days per week for 3 months. In the first study the authors found a significant reduction in spelling errors of an average of 35% among the training subjects compared with an improvement of an average of 5% in control groups, which Dybuster was only allowed to use in a second training phase.\nThe second study reproduced the training progress of the first study. In addition, it could be shown that during the course of the training the subjects were always less likely to make phoneme-graphemes. The authors concluded from this hypothesis that multi-sensory learning allows the imaging of the spoken language to be enhanced, even if the underlying neurological mechanisms have not yet been demonstrated, for example, with fMRI scans.\n\nScientific user studies by the Children's Hospital Zurich and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich were able to demonstrate significant learning success with Dybuster Calcularis. Study participants were compared with children who had studied without the Calcularis software over the same period of time. Tests relating to the mental number line and calculation showed measurable improvements in the children who had practiced with Calcularis.

This type of spatial thinking can also be used as a metaphor for non-spatial tasks, where people performing non-spatial tasks involving memory and imaging use spatial knowledge to aid in processing the task.\n\nThe cognitive map is generated from a number of sources, both from the visual system and elsewhere. Much of the cognitive map is created through self-generated movement cues. Inputs from senses like vision, proprioception, olfaction, and hearing are all used to deduce a person's location within their environment as they move through it. This allows for path integration, the creation of a vector that represents one's position and direction within one's environment, specifically in comparison to an earlier reference point. This resulting vector can be passed along to the hippocampal place cells where it is interpreted to provide more information about the environment and one's location within the context of the cognitive map.\n\nDirectional cues and positional landmarks are also used to create the cognitive map. Within directional cues, both explicit cues, like markings on a compass, as well as gradients, like shading or magnetic fields, are used as inputs to create the cognitive map. Directional cues can be used both statically, when a person does not move within his environment while interpreting it, and dynamically, when movement through a gradient is used to provide information about the nature of the surrounding environment. Positional landmarks provide information about the environment by comparing the relative position of specific objects, whereas directional cues give information about the shape of the environment itself.

The rat was conditioned to this layout and learned to turn right at the intersection in order to get to the food. When placed at different arms of the cross maze however, the rat still went in the correct direction to obtain the food because of the initial mental map it had created of the maze. Rather than just deciding to turn right at the intersection no matter what, the rat was able to determine the correct way to the food no matter where in the maze it was placed."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Epidemiology of representations assumes that human animals are cognitively predefined by their evolved neurophysiology (i.e. their cognition is massively modular). However, it also acknowledges that cognitive development plays a functional role for the formation of mental representations, concepts, intuitive theories, and the like.\n\nAccordingly, theories in cognitive science argue that humans are evolutionarily equipped with a certain brain-body setup (c.f. common coding theory) that allows them to encode and decode specific kinds of information to their memory via interacting with their environment. This is sensory-specific (i.e. visual-, acoustic-, tactile-, and olfactory perception etc.) and task or reasoning specific (i.e. formulation of intuitive theories).

Representations are updated to correspond with an environment in accordance with the function, goal-state, or desire of the system in question at any given time. Thus, for example, learning a new route through a maze-like building would be mirrored in a change in the representation of that building. Action, on this view, is the outcome of a process which determines the best way to achieve the goal-state or desire, based on current representations. Such a determinative process may be the purview of a Cartesian \"central executive\" or a distributed process like homuncular decomposition.\n\nIn contrast to traditional models of cognition, which often posit the one-way flow of sensory information from the periphery towards more remote areas of the brain, Clark has suggested a two-way \"cascade of cortical processing\" underlying perception, action, and learning. The concept of predictive processing lies at the heart of this view, wherein top-down predictions attempt to correctly guess or \"explain away\" bottom-up sensory information in an iterative, hierarchical manner. Discrepancies between the expected signal and actual signal, in essence the \"prediction error,\" travel upward to help refine the accuracy of future predictions. Interactions between forward flow of error (conveyed by \"error units\") and backward flow of prediction are dynamic, with attention playing a key role in weighting the relative influence of either at each level of the cascade (dopamine is mentioned as \"one possible mechanism for encoding precision\" with regard to error units). Action (or action-oriented predictive processing) also plays an important role in Clark's account as another means by which the brain can reduce prediction error by directly influencing the environment. To this, he adds that \"personal, affective, and hedonic\" factors would be implicated along with the minimization of prediction error, creating a more nuanced model for the relationship between action and perception."], "wikipedia-21312312": ["There is evidence that the hippocampus contains cognitive maps in humans. In one study, single-cell recordings were taken from electrodes implanted in a rat's hippocampus, and it was found that certain neurons responded strongly only when the rat was in certain locations. These cells are called place cells, and collections of these cells can be considered to be mental maps. Individual place cells do not only respond to one unique area only however, the patterns of activation of these cells overlap to form layered mental maps within the hippocampus. A good analogy is the example of the same television or computer screen pixels being used to light up any trillions of possible combinations to produce images, just as the place cells can be used in any multiple possible combinations to represent mental maps. The hippocampus' right side is more oriented towards responding to spatial aspects, whereas the left side is associated with other context information.

This type of spatial thinking can also be used as a metaphor for non-spatial tasks, where people performing non-spatial tasks involving memory and imaging use spatial knowledge to aid in processing the task.\n\nThe neural correlates of a cognitive map have been speculated to be the place cell system in the hippocampus and the recently discovered grid cells in the entorhinal cortex.\n\nCognitive mapping is believed to largely be a function of the hippocampus. The hippocampus is connected to the rest of the brain in such a way that it is ideal for integrating both spatial and nonspatial information. Connections from the postrhinal cortex and the medial entorhinal cortex provide spatial information to the hippocampus.

The results of path integration are then later used by the hippocampus to generate the cognitive map. The cognitive map likely exists on a circuit involving much more than just the hippocampus, even if it is primarily based there. Other than the medial entorhinal cortex, the presubiculum and parietal cortex have also been implicated in the generation of cognitive maps.\n\nThe cognitive map is generated from a number of sources, both from the visual system and elsewhere. Much of the cognitive map is created through self-generated movement cues. Inputs from senses like vision, proprioception, olfaction, and hearing are all used to deduce a person's location within their environment as they move through it.

For the visually impaired, these auditory cues become the primary substitute for visual information about the direction and distance of people and objects in their environment.\n\nHowever, there are a number of common obstacles to acoustic wayfinding techniques: noisy outdoor environments can challenge an individual's ability to identify useful sounds, while indoors, the architecture may not provide an acoustic response which is useful for orientation and destination. Among the most difficult environments to navigate for individuals who rely on acoustic wayfinding are crowded places like department stores, transit stations, and hotel lobbies, or open spaces like parking lots and parks, where distinct sound cues are lacking. This means that, in practice, individuals who navigate primarily by acoustic wayfinding must also rely on a number of other senses \u2013 including touch, smell, and residual sight \u2013 to supplement auditory cues. These different methods can be used in tandem. For example, visually impaired individuals often use a white cane, not only to physically locate obstacles in front of them, but also to acoustically get a sense of what those obstacles may be. By tapping the cane, they also create sound waves that help them to gauge the location and size of nearby objects."], "wikipedia-1796135": ["BULLET::::1. \"Orientation\" is the attempt to determine one's location, in relation to objects that may be nearby and the desired destination.\nBULLET::::2. \"Route decision\" is the selection of a course of direction to the destination.\nBULLET::::3. \"Route monitoring\" is checking to make sure that the selected route is heading towards the destination.\nBULLET::::4. \"Destination recognition\" is when the destination is recognized.\nHistorically, wayfinding refers to the techniques used by travelers over land and sea to find relatively unmarked and often mislabeled routes.

The basis of this work takes place in the visual cortex of the brain. The visual cortex is located in the occipital lobe of the brain and harbors many other structures that aid in visual recognition, categorization, and learning. One of the first things the brain must do when acquiring new visual information is recognize the incoming material. Brain areas involved in recognition are the inferior temporal cortex, the superior parietal cortex, and the cerebellum. During tasks of recognition, there is increased activation in the left inferior temporal cortex and decreased activation in the right superior parietal cortex. Recognition is aided by neural plasticity, or the brain's ability to reshape itself based on new information. Next the brain must categorize the material. The three main areas that are used when categorizing new visual information are the orbitofrontal cortex and two dorsolateral prefrontal regions which begin the process of sorting new information into groups and further assimilating that information into things that you might already know. After recognizing and categorizing new material entered into the visual field, the brain is ready to begin the encoding process \u2013 the process which leads to learning. Multiple brain areas are involved in this process such as the frontal lobe, the right extrastriate cortex, the neocortex, and again, the neostriatum. One area in particular, the limbic-diencephalic region, is essential for transforming perceptions into memories. With the coming together of tasks of recognition, categorization and learning; schemas help make the process of encoding new information and relating it to things you already know much easier. One can remember visual images much better when they can apply it to an already known schema. Schemas actually provide enhancement of visual memory and learning.\n\nMost studies that have focused their efforts on visual learning have found that visual learning styles as opposed to traditional learning styles greatly improve the totality of a student's learning experience. First off, visual learning engages students and student engagement is one of the most important factors that motivated students to learn. Visuals increase student interest with the use of graphics animation, and video. Consequently, it has been found that student pay greater attention to lecture material when visuals are used. With increased attention to lesson material, many positive outcomes have been seen with the use of visual tactics in the classrooms of middle aged students. Students organize and process information more thoroughly when they learn visually which helps them to understand the information better. Students are more likely to remember information that is learned with a visual aid. When teachers used visual tactics to teach middle aged students they found that students had more positive attitudes about the material they were learning. Students also exemplified higher test performance, higher standard achievement scores, thinking on levels that require higher order thinking, and more engagement."], "wikipedia-32329761": ["Because the visual layout of an influence diagram matches these natural human abilities both spatially and in the level of abstraction, people are able to take in far more information about a model's structure and organization at a glance than is possible with less visual paradigms, such as spreadsheets and mathematical expressions. Managing the structure and organization of a large model can be a significant part of the modeling process, but is substantially aided by the visualization of influence diagrams.\n\nInfluence diagrams also serve as a tool for communication. Once a quantitative model has been created and its final results computed, it is often the case that an understanding of how the results are obtained, and how various assumptions impact the results, is far more important than the specific numbers computed. The ability of a target audience to understand these aspects is critical to the modeling enterprise. The visual representation of an influence diagram quickly communicates an understanding at a level of abstraction that is normally more appropriate than detailed representations such as mathematical expressions or cell formulae. When more detail is desired, users can drill down to increasing levels of detail, speeded by the visual depiction of the model's structure.\n\nThe existence of an easily understandable and transparent model supports communication and debate within an organization, and this effect is one of the primary benefits of investing in quantitative model building. When all interested parties are able to understand a common model structure, debates and discussions will often focus more directly on specific assumptions, can cut down on \"cross-talk\", and therefore lead to more productive interactions within the organization. The influence diagram serves as a graphical representation that can help to make models accessible to people at different levels."], "wikipedia-669120": ["The evaluation of a good visual communication design is mainly based on measuring comprehension by the audience, not on personal aesthetic and/or artistic preference as there are no universally agreed-upon principles of aesthetics. Besides two dimensional images, there are other ways to express information visually - gestures and body language, animation (digital or analogue), and film. Visual communication by e-mail, a textual medium, is commonly expressed with ASCII art, emoticons, and embedded digital images.Visual communication has become one of the most important approaches using which people communicate and share information.\nThe term 'visual presentation' is used to refer to the actual presentation of information through a visible medium such as text or images. Recent research in the field has focused on web design and graphically-oriented usability. Graphic designers also use methods of visual communication in their professional practice. Visual communication on the World Wide Web is perhaps the most important form of communication that takes place while users are surfing the Internet. When experiencing the web, one uses the eyes as the primary sense, and therefore the visual presentation of a website is very important for users to understand the message or of the communication taking place.\nAldous Huxley is regarded as one of the most prominent explorers of visual communication and sight-related theories. Becoming near-blind in his teen years as the result of an illness set the stage for what would make him one of the most intellectual people to have ever explored visual communication. His work includes important novels on the dehumanizing aspects of scientific progress, most famously \"Brave New World\" and \"The Art of Seeing\". He described \"seeing\" as being the sum of sensing, selecting, and perceiving. One of his most famous quotes is \"The more you see, the more you know.\"\nVisual communication takes place through pictures, graphs and charts, as well as through signs, signals and symbols. It may be used either independently or as an adjunct to the other methods of communication.\nVisual aids are often used to help audiences of informative and persuasive speeches understand the topic being presented. Visual aids can play a large role in how the audience understands and takes in information that is presented. There are many different types of visual aids that range from handouts to PowerPoints. The type of visual aid a speaker uses depends on their preference and the information they are trying to present. Visual communication plays an important role in our daily life. Advertisement, teaching and learning, presentation and SEO and so on all involve visual communication to some extent. Each type of visual aid has pros and cons that must be evaluated to ensure it will be beneficial to the overall presentation. Before incorporating visual aids into speeches, the speaker should understand that if used incorrectly, the visual will not be an aid, but a distraction. Planning ahead is important when using visual aids. It is necessary to choose a visual aid that is appropriate for the material and audience.Visual aids can be a very powerful tool to enhance the impact of your presentations. The purpose of the visual aid is to \"enhance\" the presentation.Your visual aids are not your notes. Instead, they should add impact and emphasis to your message, thus increasing what your listeners remember and how long they retain it."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

These management games have been used both for research purposes and for training people in diverse disciplines such as management, business operation, economics, organization theory, psychology, production management, finance, accounting, and marketing. Also Faria (1990) and Dickinson note that the number of simulation games grew rapidly in the 1960s. McRaith and Goeldner list 29 marketing games, of which 20 had been developed by business firms and nine by academians for university teaching. In 1969 Graham and Gray listed nearly 200 business games of different varieties. Horn and Cleaves provided a description of 228 business games. Faria (1989) mentions that over 200 simulations were in use in the United States in over 1,700 business schools. Overall, taking advantage of computer games in education increased enormously through the 1960s to the 1980s, see for example Ju and Wagner.\nAt the end of the 1980s Faria (1990) estimated that there were approximately 228 games available in the United States, and that there were around 8,500 instructors using business games. At that point, Faria also believes that there is a large and growing number of business schools instructors and business firm users of simulation games.\nThe penetration of business gaming in academia is fuelled by the following factors: the increase in student numbers, the increase in new courses, increased adoption of methods supporting diverse learning styles, and the increasing availability of technology. Dickinson and Faria state that in US over 200 business games are being used by nearly 9,000 teachers at over 1,700 colleges offering business programmes.\nLarsen and Lomi describe the shift of the objectives of management gaming. They state that until the early 1980s simulation was used to forecast the behavior of a variety of sub-system level variables, ranging from the cash flow and financial performance of a company, to the inflation and unemployment rates of an economy. They state further, that during the last 15 years a new way of thinking about simulation emerged.

Simulation solutions can now function across the extended enterprise in a multi-CAD environment, and include solutions for managing simulation data and processes and ensuring that simulation results are made part of the product lifecycle history. The ability to use simulation across the entire lifecycle has been enhanced through improved user interfaces such as tailorable user interfaces and \"wizards\" which allow all appropriate PLM participants to take part in the simulation process.\nSection::::More examples of simulation.:Disaster preparedness.\nSimulation training has become a method for preparing people for disasters. Simulations can replicate emergency situations and track how learners respond thanks to a lifelike experience. Disaster preparedness simulations can involve training on how to handle terrorism attacks, natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks, or other life-threatening emergencies.\nOne organization that has used simulation training for disaster preparedness is CADE (Center for Advancement of Distance Education). CADE has used a video game to prepare emergency workers for multiple types of attacks. As reported by News-Medical.Net, \"The video game is the first in a series of simulations to address bioterrorism, pandemic flu, smallpox, and other disasters that emergency personnel must prepare for.\" Developed by a team from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the game allows learners to practice their emergency skills in a safe, controlled environment.\nThe Emergency Simulation Program (ESP) at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT), Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is another example of an organization that uses simulation to train for emergency situations. ESP uses simulation to train on the following situations: forest fire fighting, oil or chemical spill response, earthquake response, law enforcement, municipal firefighting, hazardous material handling, military training, and response to terrorist attack One feature of the simulation system is the implementation of \"Dynamic Run-Time Clock,\" which allows simulations to run a 'simulated' time frame, \"'speeding up' or 'slowing down' time as desired\" Additionally, the system allows session recordings, picture-icon based navigation, file storage of individual simulations, multimedia components, and launch external applications.\nAt the University of Qu\u00e9bec in Chicoutimi, a research team at the outdoor research and expertise laboratory (Laboratoire d'Expertise et de Recherche en Plein Air \u2013 LERPA) specializes in using wilderness backcountry accident simulations to verify emergency response coordination.\nInstructionally, the benefits of emergency training through simulations are that learner performance can be tracked through the system. This allows the developer to make adjustments as necessary or alert the educator on topics that may require additional attention. Other advantages are that the learner can be guided or trained on how to respond appropriately before continuing to the next emergency segment\u2014this is an aspect that may not be available in the live environment. Some emergency training simulators also allow for immediate feedback, while other simulations may provide a summary and instruct the learner to engage in the learning topic again.\nIn a live-emergency situation, emergency responders do not have time to waste. Simulation-training in this environment provides an opportunity for learners to gather as much information as they can and practice their knowledge in a safe environment. They can make mistakes without risk of endangering lives and be given the opportunity to correct their errors to prepare for the real-life emergency.\nSection::::More examples of simulation.:Economics.\nIn economics and especially macroeconomics, the effects of proposed policy actions, such as fiscal policy changes or monetary policy changes, are simulated to judge their desirability. A mathematical model of the economy, having been fitted to historical economic data, is used as a proxy for the actual economy; proposed values of government spending, taxation, open market operations, etc. are used as inputs to the simulation of the model, and various variables of interest such as the inflation rate, the unemployment rate, the balance of trade deficit, the government budget deficit, etc. are the outputs of the simulation. The simulated values of these variables of interest are compared for different proposed policy inputs to determine which set of outcomes is most desirable.\nSection::::More examples of simulation.:Engineering, technology, and processes.\nSimulation is an important feature in engineering systems or any system that involves many processes. For example, in electrical engineering, delay lines may be used to simulate propagation delay and phase shift caused by an actual transmission line. Similarly, dummy loads may be used to simulate impedance without simulating propagation and is used in situations where propagation is unwanted. A simulator may imitate only a few of the operations and functions of the unit it simulates. \"Contrast with\": emulate.\nMost engineering simulations entail mathematical modeling and computer-assisted investigation. There are many cases, however, where mathematical modeling is not reliable. Simulation of fluid dynamics problems often require both mathematical and physical simulations. In these cases the physical models require dynamic similitude. Physical and chemical simulations have also direct realistic uses, rather than research uses; in chemical engineering, for example, process simulations are used to give the process parameters immediately used for operating chemical plants, such as oil refineries. Simulators are also used for plant operator training. It is called Operator Training Simulator (OTS) and has been widely adopted by many industries from chemical to oil&gas and to the power industry. This created a safe and realistic virtual environment to train board operators and engineers. Mimic is capable of providing high fidelity dynamic models of nearly all chemical plants for operator training and control system testing.\nSection::::More examples of simulation.:Ergonomics.\nErgonomic simulation involves the analysis of virtual products or manual tasks within a virtual environment. In the engineering process, the aim of ergonomics is to develop and to improve the design of products and work environments. Ergonomic simulation utilizes an anthropometric virtual representation of the human, commonly referenced as a mannequin or Digital Human Models (DHMs), to mimic the postures, mechanical loads, and performance of a human operator in a simulated environment such as an airplane, automobile, or manufacturing facility. DHMs are recognized as evolving and valuable tool for performing proactive ergonomics analysis and design. The simulations employ 3D-graphics and physics-based models to animate the virtual humans. Ergonomics software uses inverse kinematics (IK) capability for posing the DHMs. Several ergonomic simulation tools have been developed including Jack, SAFEWORK, RAMSIS, and SAMMIE.\nThe software tools typically calculate biomechanical properties including individual muscle forces, joint forces and moments. Most of these tools employ standard ergonomic evaluation methods such as the NIOSH lifting equation and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA). Some simulations also analyze physiological measures including metabolism, energy expenditure, and fatigue limits Cycle time studies, design and process validation, user comfort, reachability, and line of sight are other human-factors that may be examined in ergonomic simulation packages.\nModeling and simulation of a task can be performed by manually manipulating the virtual human in the simulated environment. Some ergonomics simulation software permits interactive, real-time simulation and evaluation through actual human input via motion capture technologies. However, motion capture for ergonomics requires expensive equipment and the creation of props to represent the environment or product.\nSome applications of ergonomic simulation in include analysis of solid waste collection, disaster management tasks, interactive gaming, automotive assembly line, virtual prototyping of rehabilitation aids, and aerospace product design. Ford engineers use ergonomics simulation software to perform virtual product design reviews. Using engineering data, the simulations assist evaluation of assembly ergonomics. The company uses Siemen's Jack and Jill ergonomics simulation software in improving worker safety and efficiency, without the need to build expensive prototypes.\nSection::::More examples of simulation.:Finance.\nIn finance, computer simulations are often used for scenario planning. Risk-adjusted net present value, for example, is computed from well-defined but not always known (or fixed) inputs. By imitating the performance of the project under evaluation, simulation can provide a distribution of NPV over a range of discount rates and other variables. Simulations are also often used to test a financial theory or the ability of a financial model.\nSimulations are frequently used in financial training to engage participants in experiencing various historical as well as fictional situations. There are stock market simulations, portfolio simulations, risk management simulations or models and forex simulations. Such simulations are typically based on stochastic asset models. Using these simulations in a training program allows for the application of theory into a something akin to real life. As with other industries, the use of simulations can be technology or case-study driven.\nSection::::More examples of simulation.:Flight.\nFlight Simulation Training Devices (FSTD) are used to train pilots on the ground. In comparison to training in an actual aircraft, simulation-based training allows for the training of maneuvers or situations that may be impractical (or even dangerous) to perform in the aircraft while keeping the pilot and instructor in a relatively low-risk environment on the ground. For example, electrical system failures, instrument failures, hydraulic system failures, and even flight control failures can be simulated without risk to the pilots or an aircraft.\nInstructors can also provide students with a higher concentration of training tasks in a given period of time than is usually possible in the aircraft.

It gives product development teams a way to assess the operation of moving parts, to determine whether or not the product will fail, and see how the various product components interact with subsystems\u2014either pneumatic or electric. By simulating and validating the real-world performance of a product design digitally, manufacturers often can reduce the number of physical prototypes they need to create before a product can be manufactured, reducing the cost and time needed for physical prototyping. Many companies use Digital Prototyping in place of, or as a complement to, physical prototyping.\n\nDigital Prototyping changes the traditional product development cycle from designbuildtestfix to designanalyzetestbuild. Instead of needing to build multiple physical prototypes and then testing them to see if they'll work, companies can conduct testing digitally throughout the process by using Digital Prototyping, reducing the number of physical prototypes needed to validate the design. Studies show that by using Digital Prototyping to catch design problems up front, manufacturers experience fewer change orders downstream. Because the geometry in digital prototypes is highly accurate, companies can check interferences to avoid assembly issues that generate change orders in the testing and manufacturing phases of development. Companies can also perform simulations in early stages of the product development cycle, so they avoid failure modes during testing or manufacturing phases. With a Digital Prototyping approach, companies can digitally test a broader range of their product's performance. They can also test design iterations quickly to assess whether they're over- or under-designing components.\n\nDuring the engineering phase of the Digital Prototyping workflow, engineers create the product's 3D model (the digital prototype), integrating design data developed during the conceptual design phase. Teams also add electrical systems design data to the digital prototype while it's being developed, and evaluate how different systems interact. At this stage of the workflow, all data related to the product's development is fully integrated into the digital prototype. Working with mechanical, electrical, and industrial design data, companies engineer every last product detail in the engineering phase of the workflow. At this point, the digital prototype is a fully realistic digital model of the complete product.\n\nEngineers test and validate the digital prototype throughout their design process to make the best possible design decisions and avoid costly mistakes.

By implementing a digital prototype of a partially or fully automated vehicle and its sensor suite into a dynamic co-simulation of traffic flow and vehicle dynamics, a novel toolchain methodology comprising virtual testing is available for the development of automated driving functions by the automotive industry.\n\nIn a Digital Prototyping workflow, manufacturing teams are involved early in the design process. This input helps engineers and manufacturing experts work together on the digital prototype throughout the design process to ensure that the product can be produced cost effectively. Manufacturing teams can see the product exactly as it's intended, and provide input on manufacturability. Companies can perform molding simulations on digital prototypes for plastic part and injection molds to test the manufacturability of their designs, identifying potential manufacturing defects before they cut mold tooling.\n\nDigital Prototyping also enables product teams to share detailed assembly instructions digitally with manufacturing teams.

Instead of needing to build multiple physical prototypes and then testing them to see if they'll work, companies can conduct testing digitally throughout the process by using Digital Prototyping, reducing the number of physical prototypes needed to validate the design. Studies show that by using Digital Prototyping to catch design problems up front, manufacturers experience fewer change orders downstream. Because the geometry in digital prototypes is highly accurate, companies can check interferences to avoid assembly issues that generate change orders in the testing and manufacturing phases of development. Companies can also perform simulations in early stages of the product development cycle, so they avoid failure modes during testing or manufacturing phases. With a Digital Prototyping approach, companies can digitally test a broader range of their product's performance.

The USDA initiated the PDP in 1991 to test commodities in the U.S food supply for pesticide residues. Since the passage of the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), one of the focuses of the PDP has been testing foods that are most likely consumed by infants and children. The monitoring program is run by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) which partners with state agencies to collect and analyze pesticide residue data. The EPA uses this data to enhance its programs for food safety and evaluate dietary exposure to pesticides.\n\nIn addition to dietary consumption data and chemical residue data, dietary exposure assessments often need to consider other real world factors that may affect the level of exposure or a corresponding adverse effect for a particular population. A couple of the most common examples of supplemental information are the evaluation of any sensitive populations that fall within the scope of the assessment and the evaluation of the point at which residue data is collected compared to how foods are consumed.\n\nResidue data is often collected on raw agricultural commodities at the time of harvest which is not necessarily representative or the residue levels present at the time of consumption. The processing and preparation of commodities is subject to increase or decrease the level of residues at the time of consumption. For example, dehydration of a product may increase the concentration of antibiotic residue whereas washing of produce may reduce the concentration of a pesticide residue. Since chemical residue data is often only available at the raw agricultural commodity level and consumption data is often available for foods as consumed, it is necessary to convert between foods as consumed and raw agricultural commodities. This can be completed with custom models or with national databases.\n\nDEPM is an EPA dietary exposure model. The DEPM database system contains numerous national, government-sponsored food intake surveys and chemical residue data from monitoring programs. In this model, consumption is expressed in terms 11 food groups containing 800 core foods which were selected to allow matching between food consumption and chemical residue data. These 800 core food items were established from mean values of consumption of over 6,700 foods commonly identified in food surveys. This model utilizes per capita food consumption rates for these 800 core foods for the population in the USA and also for roughly 24 subpopulations defined by different demographic factors such as gender, age, and ethnicity. A critical component of the DEPM model is the recipes which convert food as consumed to the raw agricultural commodities for which the chemical residue data is collected. The residue database contains average values of residues for more than 350 pesticides and environmental contaminants."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

Central to his proposal of an ecological psychology was the notion of affordances. Gibson proposed that in any interaction between an agent and the environment, inherent conditions or qualities of the environment allow the agent to perform certain actions with the environment. He defined the term as properties in the environment that presented possibilities for action and were available for an agent to perceive directly and act upon.

The situated cognition perspective focused on \"perception-action instead of memory and retrieval\u2026A perceiving/acting agent is coupled with a developing/adapting environment and what matters is how the two interact\". Greeno (1994) also suggested that affordances are \"preconditions for activity,\" and that while they do not determine behavior, they increase the likelihood that a certain action or behavior will occur.\n\nShaw, Turvey, & Mace (as cited by Greeno, 1994) later introduced the term effectivities, the abilities of the agent that determined what the agent could do, and consequently, the interaction that could take place. Perception and action were co-determined by the effectivities and affordances, which acted 'in the moment' together. Therefore, the agent directly perceived and interacted with the environment, determining what affordances could be picked up, based on his effectivities. This view is consistent with Norman's (1988) theory of \"perceived affordances,\" which emphasizes the agent's perception of an object's utility as opposed to focusing on the object itself.\n\nAn interesting question is the relationship between affordances and mental representations as set forth in a more cognitivist perspective. While Greeno (1998) argues that attunements to affordances are superior to constructs such as schemata and mental models, Glenberg & Robertson (1999) suggested that affordances are the building blocks of mental models.\n\nSection::::Key principles.:Perception (variance/invariance).\nThe work of Gibson (1986) in the field of visual perception greatly influences situated cognition. Gibson argued that visual perception is not a matter of the eye translating inputs into symbolic representation in the brain. Instead the viewer perceives and picks up on the infinite amount of information available in the environment. Specifically, an agent perceives affordances by discovering the variants, what changes, and more importantly the invariants, what does not change across different situations. Given a specific intention (or intentional set), perceptions of invariants are co-determined by the agent and the affordances of the environment, and are then built upon over time."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This initiative was the result the collaboration of many community groups due to the increasing rates of drug and violent crimes in the region. The researchers had access to the equivalent of a \"geodatabase\", which essentially functions as a big folder with the capabilities of storing multiple files such as aerial photographs or any other file capable of depicting geographical information. This geodatabase was compiled from records of police departments and other community groups; it contained data in the form of street addresses of establishments that sell alcohol. This information was stored as software files on a computer; this enabled the analysis, the geocoding and the output of the community maps.\n\nThe researchers proceeded to compile a list of all businesses in the area of study holding a liquor sales license. The researchers limited themselves from defining Taverns as the source of the crimes. Instead, they included in their study population every business with a liquor license. This facilitated the inclusion of business that do not fit the category of a Tavern in areas with higher poverty levels, but nevertheless serve the same function.\n\nThe researchers initiated \"geocoding\" which associates an address in the real world to a map \u2013 both the addresses of the several types of liquor selling establishments and the crimes that had occurred in places where liquor beverages are sold. The crimes geocoded varied in nature and ranged from disorderly conduct to felonies. After the both crimes and establishments had been geocoded, the maps were overlaid. This facilitated the identification of liquor places with the greater number of crimes within their location or their vicinity.\n\nSome of the limitations in the study were that a high level of coordinates did not match. This was because the raw data was collected by various agencies and for different purposes. The method of analysis was to calculate the hotspot ellipses through the implementation of Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Crime (STAC). Eck and Weisburb (1995) define the process of how STAC works \u201cSTAC hot spot area searches begin with individual pin map data and build areas that reflect the actual scatter of events, regardless of arbitrary or predefined boundaries. STAC finds the densest clusters of events in the map and calculates the standard deviational ellipse that best fits each cluster.\u201d (p. 154). It was determined that the number of liquor stores and liquor related businesses were not randomly dispersed in the area. They were generally located in clusters along major roads. This supports the idea that hotspots may contain different arrangements of crime. After the hotspots were identified by the researchers, they continued to examine the hotspots arrangement and took a look at some specific address level crime concentrations. The study found that high concentrations of taverns or liquor stores do not necessarily produce high levels of crime. It concluded that there were places that were responsible for higher levels of"]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

In this study, Asch focused on the formation of character impressions by asking each participant to study a list of personality traits and make judgments and/or inferences about the possessor of each of these listed traits. The results of this study demonstrated two different types of phenomena: the primacy effect and the disproportionate effect of certain types of words. For the primacy effect, those personality traits that were listed earlier in the list seemed to have much more influence on the subject's impression of the person with that trait. However, Asch's finding that there was a variability in the effect of categorical terms such as \"warmth\" and \"coldness\" hint that those listed traits were \"susceptible to variable interpretation or construal\u2014and the specific meaning attached depended upon the more global impressions adopted by the subjects\".\n\nIn a study headed by Lee D. Ross, David Green, and Pamela House (1976), eighty Stanford University undergraduates were asked if they were willing to walk around campus for at least thirty minutes while wearing a large sandwich board sign that read \"Eat at Joe's\" and record the responses of their peers to this novel situation. The subjects were not only asked to answer whether or not they would participate, but they were also asked to estimate other people's responses, and make inferences about the disposition of each group of people based on their agreement and disagreement to participate. Overall, the experimenters found that \"those who agreed to participate thought that an average of 62% of their peers would agree\"; but, those who disagreed with participating thought that an average 33% of their peers would agree to the job\". Furthermore, those who agreed had more extreme inferences about the personal dispositions of those who disagreed, and vice versa. The results indicated that the subjects failed to recognize that their peer's construal or interpretation of the situation may be quite different from the perspective they personally take. (see also false consensus effect)\n\nIn 2004, Lee D. Ross, a professor of social psychology at Stanford University, developed a theory of a type of construal that he calls \"na\u00efve realism.\" In a simple experiment, Ross took peace proposals created by Israeli negotiators, labeled them as Palestinian proposals, and told Israeli citizens that the ideas in the proposal were the ideas that Palestinians wanted the Israeli to adopt. Then, he took the original proposals and told the Israeli subjects that ideas on the proposal were the ideas that the Israelis wanted the Palestinians to adopt. The Israeli citizens liked the proposals from the Israelis to the Palestinians more than the proposal from the Palestinians to the Israelis, even though they were the same proposal.

The speed-up is achieved by creating shortcuts in a preprocessing phase which are then used during a shortest-path query to skip over \"unimportant\" vertices. This is based on the observation that road networks are highly hierarchical.\n\nThe contraction hierarchies (CH) algorithm is a two-phase approach to the shortest path problem consisting of a preprocessing phase and a query phase. As road networks change rather infrequent, more time (seconds to hours) can be used to once precompute some calculations before queries are to be answered. Using this precomputed data many queries can be answered taking very litte time (microseconds) each. CHs rely on shortcuts to achieve this speedup. A shortcut connects two vertices formula_5 and formula_6 not connected in the original graph. Its edge weight is the sum of the edge weights on the shortest formula_5-formula_6 path.\n\nIn the query phase, a bidirectional search is performed starting from the starting node formula_34 and the target node formula_35 on the original graph augmented by the shortcuts created in the preprocessing phase.

The approaches range from subjective reviews to objective statistical tests. One approach that is commonly used is to have the model builders determine validity of the model through a series of tests.\n\nNaylor and Finger [1967] formulated a three-step approach to model validation that has been widely followed:\nStep 1. Build a model that has high face validity.\nStep 2. Validate model assumptions.\nStep 3.

Validation based on the first type usually involves analyzing the goodness of fit of the model or analyzing whether the residuals seem to be random (i.e. residual diagnostics). Validation based on the second type usually involves analyzing whether the model's predictive performance deteriorates non-negligibly when applied to pertinent new data.\nValidation based on only the first type (data that was used in the construction of the model) is often inadequate. An extreme example is illustrated in Figure\u00a01. The figure displays data (black dots) that was generated via a straight line + noise. The figure also displays a curvy line, which is a polynomial chosen to fit the data perfectly. The residuals for the curvy line are all zero. Hence validation based on only the first type of data would conclude that the curvy line was a good model. Yet the curvy line is obviously a poor model: interpolation, especially between \u22125 and \u22124, would tend to be highly misleading; moreover, any substantial extrapolation would be bad.\nThus, validation is usually not based on only considering data that was used in the construction of the model; rather, validation usually also employs data that was not used in the construction. In other words, validation usually includes testing some of the model's predictions.\n\nWhen doing a validation, there are three notable causes of potential difficulty, according to the \"Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences\". The three causes are these: lack of data; lack of control of the input variables; uncertainty about the underlying probability distributions and correlations. The usual methods for dealing with difficulties in validation include the following: checking the assumptions made in constructing the model; examining the available data and related model outputs; applying expert judgment. Note that expert judgment commonly requires expertise in the application area.\nExpert judgment can sometimes be used to assess the validity of a prediction \"without\" obtaining real data: e.g. for the curvy line in Figure\u00a01, an expert might well be able to assess that a substantial extrapolation will be invalid. Additionally, expert judgment can be used in Turing-type tests, where experts are presented with both real data and related model outputs and then asked to distinguish between the two.\n\nResidual diagnostics comprise analyses of the residuals to determine whether the residuals seem to be effectively random. Such analyses typically requires estimates of the probability distributions for the residuals. Estimates of the residuals' distributions can often be obtained by repeatedly running the model, i.e. by using repeated stochastic simulations (employing a pseudorandom number generator for random variables in the model)."], "wikipedia-15935860": ["Regression validation is the process of deciding whether the numerical results quantifying hypothesized relationships between variables, obtained from regression analysis, are acceptable as descriptions of the data. The validation process can involve analyzing the goodness of fit of the regression, analyzing whether the regression residuals are random, and checking whether the model's predictive performance deteriorates substantially when applied to data that were not used in model estimation.\n\nIf the model fit to the data were correct, the residuals would approximate the random errors that make the relationship between the explanatory variables and the response variable a statistical relationship. Therefore, if the residuals appear to behave randomly, it suggests that the model fits the data well. On the other hand, if non-random structure is evident in the residuals, it is a clear sign that the model fits the data poorly.\n\nCross-validation is the process of assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. If the model has been estimated over some, but not all, of the available data, then the model using the estimated parameters can be used to predict the held-back data.

Computer simulations are good at portraying and comparing theoretical scenarios, but in order to accurately model actual case studies they have to match what is actually happening today. A base model should be created and calibrated so that it matches the area being studied. The calibrated model should then be verified to ensure that the model is operating as expected based on the inputs. Once the model has been verified, the final step is to validate the model by comparing the outputs to historical data from the study area. This can be done by using statistical techniques and ensuring an adequate R-squared value.

Model validation is defined to mean \"substantiation that a computerized model within its domain of applicability possesses a satisfactory range of accuracy consistent with the intended application of the model\". A model should be built for a specific purpose or set of objectives and its validity determined for that purpose.\nThere are many approaches that can be used to validate a computer model. The approaches range from subjective reviews to objective statistical tests. One approach that is commonly used is to have the model builders determine validity of the model through a series of tests.\nNaylor and Finger [1967] formulated a three-step approach to model validation that has been widely followed:\nStep 1. Build a model that has high face validity.\nStep 2. Validate model assumptions.\nStep 3. Compare the model input-output transformations to corresponding input-output transformations for the real system.\nSection::::Validation.:Face validity.\nA model that has face validity appears to be a reasonable imitation of a real-world system to people who are knowledgeable of the real world system. Face validity is tested by having users and people knowledgeable with the system examine model output for reasonableness and in the process identify deficiencies. An added advantage of having the users involved in validation is that the model's credibility to the users and the user's confidence in the model increases. Sensitivity to model inputs can also be used to judge face validity. For example, if a simulation of a fast food restaurant drive through was run twice with customer arrival rates of 20 per hour and 40 per hour then model outputs such as average wait time or maximum number of customers waiting would be expected to increase with the arrival rate.\nSection::::Validation.:Validation of model assumptions.\nAssumptions made about a model generally fall into two categories: structural assumptions about how system works and data assumptions.\nSection::::Validation.:Validation of model assumptions.:Structural assumptions.\nAssumptions made about how the system operates and how it is physically arranged are structural assumptions. For example, the number of servers in a fast food drive through lane and if there is more than one how are they utilized? Do the servers work in parallel where a customer completes a transaction by visiting a single server or does one server take orders and handle payment while the other prepares and serves the order. Many structural problems in the model come from poor or incorrect assumptions. If possible the workings of the actual system should be closely observed to understand how it operates. The systems structure and operation should also be verified with users of the actual system.\nSection::::Validation.:Validation of model assumptions.:Data assumptions.\nThere must be a sufficient amount of appropriate data available to build a conceptual model and validate a model. Lack of appropriate data is often the reason attempts to validate a model fail. Data should be verified to come from a reliable source. A typical error is assuming an inappropriate statistical distribution for the data. The assumed statistical model should be tested using goodness of fit tests and other techniques. Examples of goodness of fit tests are the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test and the chi-square test. Any outliers in the data should be checked.\nSection::::Validation.:Validating input-output transformations.\nThe model is viewed as an input-output transformation for these tests. The validation test consists of comparing outputs from the system under consideration to model outputs for the same set of input conditions. Data recorded while observing the system must be available in order to perform this test. The model output that is of primary interest should be used as the measure of performance. For example, if system under consideration is a fast food drive through where input to model is customer arrival time and the output measure of performance is average customer time in line, then the actual arrival time and time spent in line for customers at the drive through would be recorded. The model would be run with the actual arrival times and the model average time in line would be compared with the actual average time spent in line using one or more tests.\nSection::::Validation.:Validating input-output transformations.:Hypothesis testing.\nStatistical hypothesis testing using the t-test can be used as a basis to accept the model as valid or reject it as invalid.\nThe hypothesis to be tested is\nversus\nThe test is conducted for a given sample size and level of significance or \u03b1. To perform the test a number \"n\" statistically independent runs of the model are conducted and an average or expected value, E(Y), for the variable of interest is produced. Then the test statistic, \"t\" is computed for the given \u03b1, \"n\", E(Y) and the observed value for the system \u03bc\nIf \nreject H, the model needs adjustment.\nThere are two types of error that can occur using hypothesis testing, rejecting a valid model called type I error or \"model builders risk\" and accepting an invalid model called Type II error, \u03b2, or \"model user's risk\". The level of significance or \u03b1 is equal the probability of type I error. If \u03b1 is small then rejecting the null hypothesis is a strong conclusion. For example, if \u03b1 = 0.05 and the null hypothesis is rejected there is only a 0.05 probability of rejecting a model that is valid. Decreasing the probability of a type II error is very important. The probability of correctly detecting an invalid model is 1 - \u03b2. The probability of a type II error is dependent of the sample size and the actual difference between the sample value and the observed value. Increasing the sample size decreases the risk of a type II error.\nSection::::Validation.:Validating input-output transformations.:Hypothesis testing.:Model accuracy as a range.\nA statistical technique where the amount of model accuracy is specified as a range has recently been developed. The technique uses hypothesis testing to accept a model if the difference between a model's variable of interest and a system's variable of interest is within a specified range of accuracy. A requirement is that both the system data and model data be approximately Normally Independent and Identically Distributed (NIID). The t-test statistic is used in this technique. If the mean of the model is \u03bc and the mean of system is \u03bc then the difference between the model and the system is D = \u03bc - \u03bc. The hypothesis to be tested is if D is within the acceptable range of accuracy. Let L = the lower limit for accuracy and U = upper limit for accuracy. Then\nversus\nis to be tested.\nThe operating characteristic (OC) curve is the probability that the null hypothesis is accepted when it is true. The OC curve characterizes the probabilities of both type I and II errors. Risk curves for model builder's risk and model user's can be developed from the OC curves. Comparing curves with fixed sample size tradeoffs between model builder's risk and model user's risk can be seen easily in the risk curves. If model builder's risk, model user's risk, and the upper and lower limits for the range of accuracy are all specified then the sample size needed can be calculated.\nSection::::Validation.:Validating input-output transformations.:Confidence intervals.\nConfidence intervals can be used to evaluate if a model is \"close enough\" to a system for some variable of interest. The difference between the known model value, \u03bc, and the system value, \u03bc, is checked to see if it is less than a value small enough that the model is valid with respect that variable of interest. The value is denoted by the symbol \u03b5. To perform the test a number, \"n\", statistically independent runs of the model are conducted and a mean or expected value, E(Y) or \u03bc for simulation output variable of interest Y, with a standard deviation \"S\" is produced. A confidence level is selected, 100(1-\u03b1). An interval, [a,b], is constructed by\nwhere \nis the critical value from the t-distribution for the given level of significance and"], "wikipedia-26502065": ["Model validation can be based on two types of data: data that was used in the construction of the model and data that was not used in the construction. Validation based on the first type usually involves analyzing the goodness of fit of the model or analyzing whether the residuals seem to be random (i.e. residual diagnostics). Validation based on the second type usually involves analyzing whether the model's predictive performance deteriorates non-negligibly when applied to pertinent new data.\n\nValidation based on only the first type (data that was used in the construction of the model) is often inadequate. An extreme example is illustrated in Figure\u00a01. The figure displays data (black dots) that was generated via a straight line + noise. The figure also displays a curvy line, which is a polynomial chosen to fit the data perfectly. The residuals for the curvy line are all zero. Hence validation based on only the first type of data would conclude that the curvy line was a good model. Yet the curvy line is obviously a poor model: interpolation, especially between \u22125 and \u22124, would tend to be highly misleading; moreover, any substantial extrapolation would be bad. \n\nThus, validation is usually not based on only considering data that was used in the construction of the model; rather, validation usually also employs data that was not used in the construction. In other words, validation usually includes testing some of the model's predictions.\n\nA model can be validated only relative to some application area. A model that is valid for one application might be invalid for some other applications. As an example, consider the curvy line in Figure\u00a01: if the application only used inputs from the interval [0,\u00a02], then the curvy line might well be an acceptable model.\n\nWhen doing a validation, there are three notable causes of potential difficulty, according to the \"Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences\". The three causes are these: lack of data; lack of control of the input variables; uncertainty about the underlying probability distributions and correlations. The usual methods for dealing with difficulties in validation include the following: checking the assumptions made in constructing the model; examining the available data and related model outputs; applying expert judgment. Note that expert judgment commonly requires expertise in the application area. \n\nExpert judgment can sometimes be used to assess the validity of a prediction \"without\" obtaining real data: e.g. for the curvy line in Figure\u00a01, an expert might well be able to assess that a substantial extrapolation will be invalid. Additionally, expert judgment can be used in Turing-type tests, where experts are presented with both real data and related model outputs and then asked to distinguish between the two.\n\nFor some classes of statistical models, specialized methods of performing validation are available. As an example, if the statistical model was obtained via a regression, then specialized analyses for regression model validation exist and are generally employed.\n\nResidual diagnostics comprise analyses of the residuals to determine whether the residuals seem to be effectively random. Such analyses typically requires estimates of the probability distributions for the residuals. Estimates of the residuals' distributions can often be obtained by repeatedly running the model, i.e. by using repeated stochastic simulations (employing a pseudorandom number generator for random variables in the model).\n\nIf the statistical model was obtained via a regression, then regression-residual diagnostics exist and may be used; such diagnostics have been well studied."], "wikipedia-15935860": ["The validation process can involve analyzing the goodness of fit of the regression, analyzing whether the regression residuals are random, and checking whether the model's predictive performance deteriorates substantially when applied to data that were not used in model estimation.\n\nSection::::Goodness of fit.\nOne measure of goodness of fit is the \"R\" (coefficient of determination), which in ordinary least squares with an intercept ranges between 0 and 1. However, an \"R\" close to 1 does not guarantee that the model fits the data well: as Anscombe's quartet shows, a high \"R\" can occur in the presence of misspecification of the functional form of a relationship or in the presence of outliers that distort the true relationship.\nOne problem with the \"R\" as a measure of model validity is that it can always be increased by adding more variables into the model, except in the unlikely event that the additional variables are exactly uncorrelated with the dependent variable in the data sample being used. This problem can be avoided by doing an F-test of the statistical significance of the increase in the \"R\", or by instead using the adjusted \"R\"2.\n\nSection::::Analysis of residuals.\nThe residuals from a fitted model are the differences between the responses observed at each combination of values of the explanatory variables and the corresponding prediction of the response computed using the regression function. Mathematically, the definition of the residual for the \"i\" observation in the data set is written\nwith \"y\" denoting the \"i\" response in the data set and \"x\" the vector of explanatory variables, each set at the corresponding values found in the \"i\" observation in the data set.\nIf the model fit to the data were correct, the residuals would approximate the random errors that make the relationship between the explanatory variables and the response variable a statistical relationship. Therefore, if the residuals appear to behave randomly, it suggests that the model fits the data well. On the other hand, if non-random structure is evident in the residuals, it is a clear sign that the model fits the data poorly. The next section details the types of plots to use to test different aspects of a model and gives the correct interpretations of different results that could be observed for each type of plot.\n\nSection::::Analysis of residuals.:Graphical analysis of residuals.\nA basic, though not quantitatively precise, way to check for problems that render a model inadequate is to conduct a visual examination of the residuals (the mispredictions of the data used in quantifying the model) to look for obvious deviations from randomness. If a visual examination suggests, for example, the possible presence of heteroskedasticity (a relationship between the variance of the model errors and the size of an independent variable's observations), then statistical tests can be performed to confirm or reject this hunch; if it is confirmed, different modeling procedures are called for.\nDifferent types of plots of the residuals from a fitted model provide information on the adequacy of different aspects of the model.\nBULLET::::1. sufficiency of the functional part of the model: scatter plots of residuals versus predictors\nBULLET::::2. non-constant variation across the data: scatter plots of residuals versus predictors; for data collected over time, also plots of residuals against time\nBULLET::::3. drift in the errors (data collected over time): run charts of the response and errors versus time\nBULLET::::4. independence of errors: lag plot\nBULLET::::5. normality of errors: histogram and normal probability plot\nGraphical methods have an advantage over numerical methods for model validation because they readily illustrate a broad range of complex aspects of the relationship between the model and the data.\n\nSection::::Analysis of residuals.:Quantitative analysis of residuals.\nNumerical methods also play an important role in model validation. For example, the lack-of-fit test for assessing the correctness of the functional part of the model can aid in interpreting a borderline residual plot. One common situation when numerical validation methods take precedence over graphical methods is when the number of parameters being estimated is relatively close to the size of the data set. In this situation residual plots are often difficult to interpret due to constraints on the residuals imposed by the estimation of the unknown parameters. One area in which this typically happens is in optimization applications using designed experiments. Logistic regression with binary data is another area in which graphical residual analysis can be difficult.\nSerial correlation of the residuals can indicate model misspecification, and can be checked for with the Durbin\u2013Watson statistic. The problem of heteroskedasticity can be checked for in any of several ways.\n\nSection::::Out-of-sample evaluation.\nCross-validation is the process of assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. If the model has been estimated over some, but not all, of the available data, then the model using the estimated parameters can be used to predict the held-back data. If, for example, the out-of-sample mean squared error, also known as the mean squared prediction error, is substantially higher than the in-sample mean square error, this is a sign of deficiency in the model. \nA development in medical statistics is the use of out-of-sample cross validation techniques in meta-analysis. It forms the basis of the \"validation statistic, Vn\", which is used to test the statistical validity of meta-analysis summary estimates. Essentially it measures a type of normalized prediction error and its distribution is a linear combination of \"\u03c7\" variables of degree 1."], "wikipedia-4639454": ["Qualification includes the following steps:\nBULLET::::- Design qualification (DQ)- Demonstrates that the proposed design (or the existing design for an off-the-shelf item) will satisfy all the requirements that are defined and detailed in the User Requirements Specification (URS).

A picture is then taken of the palate to record the location of contact and, if another palatogram is to be taken, the mouth is washed out and the tongue repainted. A particularly low cost method that is often used in fieldwork, it can be difficult to collect large amounts of data.\nElectropalatography involves the use of a custom-fitted artificial palate containing electrodes that measure contact. While able to record multiple contacts, the artificial palate may obstruct or interfere with articulation, and each subject requires a custom-fitted palate.\nSection::::Alternative methods.:Video fluoroscopy.\nVideo fluoroscopy uses x-ray radiation to produce moving pictures of the mouth during articulation or swallowing. It is considered the gold standard in studies of dysphagia because of its ability to take videos of the entire digestive tract during swallowing events. It is often used to study and treat aspiration of food, what parts of the digestive tract are malfunctioning during swallowing, and positions in which swallowing is easiest. Only limited data is able to be collected as sessions are typically limited to three minutes due to the hazards of radiation exposure. and it does not allow for fine grain analysis of tongue movements.\nSection::::Alternative methods.:X-ray microbeam.\nSimilar to video fluoroscopy, X-ray microbeam studies use radiation to study movements of articulators. Gold pellets, 2 to 3 mm in size, are placed in and around the mouth similar to the coils used in EMA. Radiation exposure is limited by using computer software to focus narrow x-ray beams, about 6mm, on the pellets and track them as they move. Like EMA, x-ray microbeam studies are limited by the placement of the pellets.

Computer simulations are good at portraying and comparing theoretical scenarios, but in order to accurately model actual case studies they have to match what is actually happening today. A base model should be created and calibrated so that it matches the area being studied. The calibrated model should then be verified to ensure that the model is operating as expected based on the inputs. Once the model has been verified, the final step is to validate the model by comparing the outputs to historical data from the study area. This can be done by using statistical techniques and ensuring an adequate R-squared value. Unless these techniques are employed, the simulation model created will produce inaccurate results and not be a useful prediction tool.\nModel calibration is achieved by adjusting any available parameters in order to adjust how the model operates and simulates the process. For example, in traffic simulation, typical parameters include look-ahead distance, car-following sensitivity, discharge headway, and start-up lost time. These parameters influence driver behavior such as when and how long it takes a driver to change lanes, how much distance a driver leaves between his car and the car in front of it, and how quickly a driver starts to accelerate through an intersection. Adjusting these parameters has a direct effect on the amount of traffic volume that can traverse through the modeled roadway network by making the drivers more or less aggressive. These are examples of calibration parameters that can be fine-tuned to match characteristics observed in the field at the study location. Most traffic models have typical default values but they may need to be adjusted to better match the driver behavior at the specific location being studied.\nModel verification is achieved by obtaining output data from the model and comparing them to what is expected from the input data. For example, in traffic simulation, traffic volume can be verified to ensure that actual volume throughput in the model is reasonably close to traffic volumes input into the model. Ten percent is a typical threshold used in traffic simulation to determine if output volumes are reasonably close to input volumes. Simulation models handle model inputs in different ways so traffic that enters the network, for example, may or may not reach its desired destination. Additionally, traffic that wants to enter the network may not be able to, if congestion exists. This is why model verification is a very important part of the modeling process.\nThe final step is to validate the model by comparing the results with what is expected based on historical data from the study area. Ideally, the model should produce similar results to what has happened historically. This is typically verified by nothing more than quoting the R-squared statistic from the fit. This statistic measures the fraction of variability that is accounted for by the model. A high R-squared value does not necessarily mean the model fits the data well. Another tool used to validate models is graphical residual analysis. If model output values drastically differ from historical values, it probably means there is an error in the model. Before using the model as a base to produce additional models, it is important to verify it for different scenarios to ensure that each one is accurate. If the outputs do not reasonably match historic values during the validation process, the model should be reviewed and updated to produce results more in line with expectations.

Simulation of transportation systems started over forty years ago, and is an important area of discipline in traffic engineering and transportation planning today. Various national and local transportation agencies, academic institutions and consulting firms use simulation to aid in their management of transportation networks.\nSimulation in transportation is important because it can study models too complicated for analytical or numerical treatment, can be used for experimental studies, can study detailed relations that might be lost in analytical or numerical treatment and can produce attractive visual demonstrations of present and future scenarios.\nTo understand simulation, it is important to understand the concept of system state, which is a set of variables that contains enough information to describe the evolution of the system over time. System state can be either discrete or continuous. Traffic simulation models are classified according to discrete and continuous time, state, and space.\nSimulation methods in transportation can employ a selection of theories, including probability and statistics, differential equations and numerical methods.\n- Monte Carlo method\nOne of the earliest discrete event simulation models is the Monte Carlo simulation, where a series of random numbers are used to synthesise traffic conditions.\n- Cellular automata model\nThis was followed by the cellular automata model that generates randomness from deterministic rules.\n- Discrete event and continuous-time simulation\nMore recent methods use either discrete event simulation or continuous-time simulation.

Hence, the modeling is done on the subsystem level without having the coupled problem in mind. Furthermore, the coupled simulation is carried out by running the subsystems in a black-box manner. During the simulation the subsystems will exchange data. Co-simulation can be considered as the joint simulation of the already well-established tools and semantics; when they are simulated with their suitable solvers. Co-simulation proves its advantage in validation of multi-domain and cyber physical system by offering a flexible solution which allows consideration of multiple domains with different time steps, at the same time. As the calculation load is shared among simulators, co-simulation also enables the possibility of large scale system assessment.\n\nThe partitioning procedure identifies the process of spatial separation of the coupled problem into multiple partitioned subsystems. Information is exchanged through either ad-hoc interfaces or via intermediate buffer governed by a master algorithm. Master algorithm (where exists) is responsible for instantiating the simulators and for orchestrating the information exchange (simulator-simulator or simulator-orchestrator).\n\nCo-simulation coupling methods can be classified into operational integration and formal integration, depending on abstraction layers. In general, operational integration is used in co-simulation for a specific problem and aims for interoperability at dynamic and technical layers (i.e. signal exchange). On the other hand, formal integration allows interoperability in semantic and syntactic level via either model coupling or simulator coupling. Formal integration often involves a master federate to orchestrate the semantic and syntactic of the interaction among simulators.\n\nThere exist two principal communication patterns for master algorithms. The Gauss-Seidel and the Jacobi variants. The names of these two methods are derived from the structural similarities to the numerical methods by the same name.\n\nFor signals co-simulation can be performed with a standardized interface called Functional Mock-up Interface.\n\nAgent-based model is a modeling approach of complex systems.

Examples of aggregates in micro- and macroeconomics relative to less aggregated counterparts are:\nBULLET::::- Food vs. apples\nBULLET::::- Price level and real GDP vs. the price and quantity of apples\nBULLET::::- Capital stock vs. the value of computers of a certain type and the value of steam shovels\nBULLET::::- Money supply vs. paper currency\nBULLET::::- General unemployment rate vs. the unemployment rate of civil engineers\nStandard theory uses simple assumptions to derive general, and commonly accepted, results such as the law of demand to explain market behavior.

The processing facility has the following choices to manipulate the rock mass: reduce rock size, remove fines, reduce moisture content add commercial gravel and sand to blend it with the recyled tunnel debries. The main role in processing tunnel rock is crushing the rocks into smaller sizes. Rock crushing is divided into two methods based on compression or impact resulting in different type of fragmentation of the material. Crushers are used in the aggregate and mineral industry and can also be divided into stationary and mobile plants. Setup of the crushers, feed size and speeds plays a major role in production of high quality construction aggregates. In Tunnel boring machine (TBM) tunneling mechanical screening (scalping screener) is normally the first stage of the processing of tunnel rock. The screener removes rock particles below 16 or 20 mm diameter. This is to remove the high amounts of fines which is created when TBM tunneling in hard rock. To much fines in concrete aggregates is unwanted. If a tunnel project want to create concrete aggregates as 0/8 mm or 0/4 mm fractions it requires a more advance processing facility. Classification covers the size control of particles < 1mm. Conventional screeners and crushers are not applicable below this size. A range of methods can be used for classification, though all built on certain fundamentals. These are utilizing the natural gravitational force and the particles corresponding behavior to separate the particles into fractions or dividing a liquid from particles (dewatering/clarifying). One type of classifier is the Air classifier. Classification accuracy will be of relevance as concrete aggregates do have boundary limits according to Particle-size distribution (grading) on Filler (materials) in the sand fraction. Particles in this size range do also tend to cluster together. These phenomena are called agglomeration and is unfortunate in terms of concrete batching. Removing fines is often done with water involved, this requires a water treatment plant to clean the water. This can be done with sedimentation tanks and filter press, requiring quite a lot of space.

As an example, consider the curvy line in Figure\u00a01: if the application only used inputs from the interval [0,\u00a02], then the curvy line might well be an acceptable model."], "wikipedia-239140": ["Validity is the extent to which a concept, conclusion or measurement is well-founded and likely corresponds accurately to the real world. The word \"valid\" is derived from the Latin validus, meaning strong. This should not be confused with notions of certainty nor necessity. The validity of a measurement tool (for example, a test in education) is considered to be the degree to which the tool measures what it claims to measure. Validity is based on the strength of a collection of different types of evidence (e.g. face validity, construct validity, etc.) described in greater detail below.\n\nIn psychometrics, validity has a particular application known as test validity: \"the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores\" (\"as entailed by proposed uses of tests\").\n\nIt is generally accepted that the concept of scientific validity addresses the nature of reality in terms of statistical measures and as such is an epistemological and philosophical issue as well as a question of measurement. The use of the term in logic is narrower, relating to the truth of inferences made from premises. In logic, and therefore as the term is applied to any epistemological claim, validity refers to the consistency of an argument flowing from the premises to the conclusion; as such, the truth of the claim in logic is not only reliant on validity. Rather, an argumentative claim is true if and only if it is both valid and sound. This means the argument flows without contradiction from the premises or the conclusion, and all of the premises and the conclusion correspond to known facts. As such, \"scientific or statistical validity\" is not a deductive claim that is necessarily truth preserving, but is an inductive claim that remains true or false in an undecided manner. This is why \"scientific or statistical validity\" is a claim that is qualified as being either strong or weak in its nature, it is never necessary nor certainly true. This has the effect of making claims of \"scientific or statistical validity\" open to interpretation as to what, in fact, the facts of the matter mean. \n\nValidity is important because it can help determine what types of tests to use, and help to make sure researchers are using methods that are not only ethical, and cost-effective, but also a method that truly measures the idea or constructs in question."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. **Yes**  \n2.

In his 1948 article \"The Structure and Function of Communication in Society\", Lasswell wrote:\n[A] convenient way to describe an act of communication is to answer the following questions:\nBULLET::::- Who\nBULLET::::- Says What\nBULLET::::- In Which Channel\nBULLET::::- To Whom\nBULLET::::- With What Effect?\n\nThe model organizes the \"scientific study of the process of communication\". The main focus of the model is broken down by each element of communication: who' refers to the communicator who formulates the message; 'what' is the content of message; 'channel' indicates the medium of transmission; 'whom' describes either an individual recipient or the audience of mass communication; 'effect' is the outcome of the message...\" The movement of the message travels from the communicator to the audience. Although this model represents a one-way flow of communication, the \"effect\" also refers to feedback in public relations. The model can be used in pedagogical settings to teach students major elements of a communication process and as a starting point for developing hypotheses.\n\nLasswell stated that the \"Who\" referred to \"control analysis\", the \"Says What\" referred to \"content analysis\", the \"In Which Channel\" referred to \"media analysis\", the \"To Whom\" referred to \"audience analysis\", and the \"With What Effect\" referred to \"effect analysis\"."], "wikipedia-14765980": ["Hatley\u2013Pirbhai modeling is a system modeling technique based on the input\u2013process\u2013output model (IPO model), which extends the IPO model by adding user interface processing and maintenance and self-testing processing.\nThe five components\u2014inputs, outputs, user interface, maintenance, and processing\u2014are added to a system model template to allow for modeling of the system which allows for proper assignment to the processing regions. This modeling technique allows for creation of a hierarchy of detail of which the top level of this hierarchy should consist of a context diagram. The context diagram serves the purpose of \"establish[ing] the information boundary between the system being implemented and the environment in which the system is to operate.\" Further refinement of the context diagram requires analysis of the system designated by the shaded rectangle through the development of a system functional flow block diagram.

In Jainism and Hinduism, this is closely related to the concept of ahimsa, nonviolence toward other beings. In Jainism, all matter is endowed with sentience; there are five degrees of sentience, from one to five. Water, for example, is a sentient being of the first order, as it is considered to possess only one sense, that of touch. Man is considered a sentient being of the fifth order. According to Buddhism, sentient beings made of pure consciousness are possible. In Mahayana Buddhism, which includes Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, the concept is related to the Bodhisattva, an enlightened being devoted to the liberation of others. The first vow of a Bodhisattva states: \"Sentient beings are numberless; I vow to free them.\"\nSentience in Buddhism is the state of having senses. In Buddhism, there are six senses, the sixth being the subjective experience of the mind. Sentience is simply awareness prior to the arising of Skandha. Thus, an animal qualifies as a sentient being.\nIn the philosophies of animal welfare and rights, sentience implies the ability to experience pleasure and pain. Additionally, it has been argued, as in the documentary \"Earthlings\": \nAnimal-welfare advocates typically argue that any sentient being is entitled, at a minimum, to protection from unnecessary suffering, though animal-rights advocates may differ on what rights (e.g., the right to life) may be entailed by simple sentience. Sentiocentrism describes the theory that sentient individuals are the center of moral concern.\nThe laws of several states include certain invertebrates such as cephalopods (octopuses, squids) and decapod crustaceans (lobsters, crabs) in the scope of animal protection laws, implying that these animals are also judged capable of experiencing pain and suffering.\nIn science fiction, an alien, android, robot, hologram, or computer described as \"sentient\" is usually treated as a fully human character, with similar rights, qualities, and capabilities as any other character; it is not human, but in this work of fiction it has genuine \"personhood\". \"Sentience\", in this context, is a hypothetical essential human property that brings many other qualities associated with personhood with it, such as will, desire, intelligence, autonomy, humor, aesthetic appreciation and so on.

Nor is there any radical separation between that which is named and the naming.\" Said another way, a knower (as \"subject\") and what they know (as \"object\" whether human, tangible, or intangible) are inseparable and must be understood as such to live a truly satisfying life .\n\nThe discourse of transactionalist problem-solving is applied to a vast array of academic and professional discourses including educational philosophy in the humanities; social psychology, political science, and political anthropology in the social sciences; and occupational science in the health sciences; cognitive science, zoology, and quantum mechanics in the natural sciences; and transactional competence and leadership-as-practice in business."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The idea can be applied in various technological fields. UIL assumes that human users of a network are among the smartest but also most unpredictable units of that network. Furthermore, human users often have a certain set of (input) values that they sense (more or less observe, but also acoustic or haptic feedback is imaginable: imagine a gas pedal in a car giving some resistance, like for a speedomat). Both elements of smart decision-making and observed values can help towards improving the bigger objective.\nThe input values are meant to encourage/discourage human users to behave in certain ways that improve the overall performance of the system. One example of a historic implementation related to UIL has appeared in electric power networks where a price chart is introduced to users of electrical power. This price chart differentiates the values of electricity based on off-peak, mid-peak and on-peak periods, for instance. Faced with a non-homogenous pattern of pricing, human users respond by changing their power consumption accordingly that eventually leads to the overall improvement of access to electrical power (reduce peak hour consumption). Recently, UIL has been also introduced for wireless telecommunications (cellular networks).\nWireless resources including the bandwidth (frequency) are an increasingly scarce resource and the while current demand on wireless network is below the supply in most of the times (potentials capacity of the wireless links based on technology limitations), the rapid and exponential increase in demand will render wireless access an increasingly expensive resource in a matter of few years. While usual technological responses to this perspective such as innovative new generations of cellular systems, more efficient resource allocations, cognitive radio and machine learning are certainly necessary, it seems that they ignore a major resource in the system, namely the users. Wireless users can be encouraged to change their \"wireless behavior\" by introducing incentives, e.g., differentiated pricing. In addition, the increasing concern for the environment and the considerable yet invisible environmental effects of wireless use can be tapped into in order to convince \"greener\" user to change their wireless behavior in order to reduce their carbon footprint.\nUIL used in wireless communications is referred to as the Smart Grid of Communications. It aims for avoiding a location of bad link adaptation or excess use during the busy hour."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. **Yes**  \n\n2.

The Medici's direct hand in the affairs of the Feste de' Magi, Florence as a symbol for the Holy Land, and San Marco as the final destination and the symbol of Bethlehem surely served to adulate the Medici position. For the Medici, the festival was more of a political instrument than anything else. The Medici's reign over San Marco and Cosimo's patronage were not just expressions of the Dominican Observance, but a foothold for political development as well. The saints play an integral role in the structure and program of the altarpiece. The two patron physician saints, Saints Cosmas and Damian, are the most commented on subjects of the painting as the intercessors between the Virgin and Child. Saint Cosmas's representation pays homage to Cosimo de' Medici since it has been identified as a portrait of Cosimo himself. On the far left, Saint Lawrence, representing Cosimo's brother Lawrence, too glances out towards the viewer as an invitation into the holy space of the Virgin and Child. He also represents Cosmas' deceased brother, Lorenzo. Next to Saint Lawrence is Saint John the Evangelist standing for both Cosimo's father, Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici and Cosimo's own son, Giovanni de' Medici. The right side of the painting features Saint Dominic, closest to the Virgin, and Saint Peter the Martyr, closest to the viewer, as the 2nd Dominican saint depicted.

However, if the concepts are highly specialized, niche, or original to the presenter, Wikipedia may not cover them.", "wikipedia-1247287": ["Greene begins with the key question: \"what is reality?\", or more specifically, \"what is spacetime?\" He sets out to describe the features he finds both exciting and essential to forming a full picture of the reality painted by modern science. In almost every chapter, Greene introduces basic concepts and then slowly builds to a climax, usually a scientific breakthrough. Greene then attempts to connect with his reader by posing simple analogies to help explain the meaning of a scientific concept without oversimplifying the theory behind it.\n\nChapter 1, Roads to Reality, introduces what is to come later in the book, such as discussions revolving around classical physics, quantum mechanics, and cosmological physics.\n\nChapter 2, \"The Universe and the Bucket\", features space as its key point. The question posed by Greene is this: \"Is space a human abstraction, or is it a physical entity?\" The key thought experiment is a spinning bucket of water, designed to make one think about what creates the force felt inside the bucket when it is spinning. The ideas of Isaac Newton, Ernst Mach, and Gottfried Leibniz on this thought experiment are discussed in detail.\n\nChapter 3, \"Relativity and the Absolute\", focuses on spacetime. The question now becomes: \"Is spacetime an Einsteinian abstraction or a physical entity?\" In this chapter, concepts of both special relativity and general relativity are discussed, as well as their importance to the meaning of spacetime.\n\nIn chapter 4, \"Entangling Space\", Greene explores the revolution of the quantum mechanical era, focusing on what it means for objects to be separate and distinct in a universe dictated by quantum laws. This chapter studies quantum mechanics, including the concepts of probability waves and interference patterns, particle spin, the photon double slit experiment, and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The reader is also informed of challenges posed to quantum mechanics by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen.\n\nChapter 5, \"The Frozen River\", deals with the question, \"Does time flow?\" One key point in this chapter deals with special relativity. Observers moving relative to each other have different conceptions of what exists at a given moment, and hence they have different conceptions of reality. The conclusion is that time does not flow, as all things simultaneously exist at the same time.\n\nChapter 6, \"Chance and the Arrow\", asks, \"Does time have an arrow?\" The reader discovers that the laws of physics apply moving both forward in time and backward in time. Such a law is called time-reversal symmetry. One of the major subjects of this chapter is entropy. Various analogies are given to illustrate how entropy works and its apparent paradoxes. The climax of the chapter is the co-relation between entropy and gravity, and that the beginning of the Universe must be the state of minimum entropy.\n\nChapter 7, \"Time and the Quantum\", gives insights into time's nature in the quantum realm. Probability plays a major role in this chapter because it is an inescapable part of quantum mechanics. The double slit experiment is revisited to reveal things about the past. Many other experiments are presented in this chapter, such as the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment. Other major issues are brought to the reader's attention, such as quantum mechanics and experience, as well as quantum mechanics and the measurement problem. Finally, this chapter addresses the important subject of decoherence and its relevance towards the macroscopic world.\n\nChapter 8, \"Of Snowflakes and Spacetime\", tells the reader that the history of the universe is in fact the history of symmetry. Symmetry and its importance to cosmic evolution becomes the focus of this chapter. Again, general relativity is addressed as a stretching fabric of spacetime. Cosmology, symmetry, and the shape of space are put together in a new way.\n\nChapter 9, \"Vaporizing the Vacuum\", introduces the theoretical idea of the Higgs boson. This chapter focuses on the critical first fraction of a second after the Big Bang, when the amount of symmetry in the universe was thought to have changed abruptly by a process known as symmetry breaking. This chapter also brings into play the theory of grand unification and entropy is also revisited.\n\nChapter 10, \"Deconstructing the Bang\", makes inflationary cosmology the main point. General relativity and the discovery of dark energy (repulsive gravity) are taken into account, as well as the cosmological constant. Certain problems that arise due to the standard Big Bang theory are addressed, and new answers are given using inflationary cosmology. Such problems include the horizon problem and the flatness problem. Matter distribution throughout the cosmos is also discussed, including the concepts of dark matter and dark energy.\n\nChapter 11, \"Quanta in the Sky with Diamonds\", continues with the topic of inflation, and the arrow of time is also discussed again. The chapter addresses three main developments: the formation of structures such as galaxies, the amount of energy required to spawn the universe we now see, and the origin of time's arrow.\n\nChapter 12, \"The World on a String\", informs the reader of the structure of the fabric of space according to string theory. New concepts are introduced, including the Planck length and the Planck time, and ideas from \"The Elegant Universe\" are revisited. The reader will learn how string theory could fill the gaps between general relativity and quantum mechanics.\n\nChapter 13, \"The Universe on a Brane\", expands on ideas from chapter 12, particularly on M-theory, of which string theory is a branch. This chapter is devoted to speculations on space and time. The insights of a number of physicists, including Edward Witten and Paul Dirac, are presented. The focus of the chapter becomes gravity and its involvement with extra dimensions. Near the end of the chapter, a brief section is devoted to the cyclic model.\n\nChapter 14, \"Up in the Heavens and Down on the Earth\", is about various experiments with space and time. Previous theories are brought back from previous chapters, such as Higgs theory, supersymmetry, and string theory. Future planned experiments are described in an attempt to verify many of the theoretical concepts discussed, including the constituents of dark matter and dark energy, the existence of the Higgs boson, and the verification of extra spatial dimensions.\n\nChapter 15, \"Teleporters and Time Machines\", is about traveling through space and time using intriguing methods.

The language of the story or requirement is used to directly guide development of the feature \u2013 even naming the modules and function calls. As a consequence, the feature implementation tends to closely represent the customer's desire with little extraneous or unneeded functionality. The language of the source code also corresponds closely to the customer's stories.\n\nPresenter first is often applied in graphical user interface applications. It is equally well applied to the development of command-line interfaces. Further, a slight variation of the approach has been used effectively in embedded software; here the integral design pattern is known as model\u2013conductor\u2013hardware and the approach is termed \"conductor first\".\n\nWhen used in GUI applications, this approach allows the presentation logic and business logic of the application to be developed in a test first manner decoupled from on-screen widgets.

In this theory, our lives are as if on a stage, setting us individuals as actors on that stage as a way to understand human motives and relations. Burke discusses two important ideas \u2013 that life is drama, and the ultimate motive of rhetoric is the purging of guilt. Burke recognized guilt as the base of human emotions and motivations for action. As cited in \"A Note on Burke on \"Motive\",\" the author recognized the importance of \"motive\" in Burke's work. And in \"Kenneth Burke's concept of motives in rhetorical theory,\" the authors mentioned that Burke believes that when guilty \"combined with other constructs, describes the totality of the compelling force within an event which explains why the event took place.\"\nTo understand people's movement and intentions, the theorist sets up the Five Dramatistic Pentad strategy for viewing life, not as life itself, by comparing each social unit involved in human activities as five elements of drama \u2013 act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose, to answer the empirical question of how persons explain their actions, and to find the ultimate motivations of human activities.\nSection::::Background and Assumptions.\nSection::::Background and Assumptions.:Background.\nWhy use \"drama\" as the metaphor? According to West, there are three basic reasons that drama is a useful metaphor to the idea of Dramatism.\nBULLET::::1. Drama indicates a wide range of human experience.\nBULLET::::2. There are typical genres that drama follows, which is similar to communications in human lives.\nBULLET::::3. Drama is closely related to audiences, which shows the struggles of audiences and also provides suggestions.\nIt is possible because Burke believes that Drama has recognizable genres. Humans use language in patterned discourses, and texts move us with recurring patterns underlying those texts. And drama has certain audiences, which means rhetoric plays a crucial role when humans deal with experiences. Language strategies are central to Burke's dramatistic approach.\nSection::::Background and Assumptions.:Assumptions.\nBecause of the complexity and extension of Burke's thinking, it is difficult to label the ontology behind his theory. However, some basic assumptions can still be extracted to support the understanding of dramatism.\nBULLET::::1. Some of what we do is motivated by animality and some of it by symbolicity. Human's drinking water is to satisfy the thirst, which is an animal need; while the action of reading papers is influenced by symbols. Burke's position is that both animal nature and symbols motivate us. For him, of all the symbols, language is the most important. Brummett , shares a smilier idea in his book \"Landmark Essays on Kenneth Burke\", that \u201cteeters between the realizations that some of what we do is motivated by animality and some of it by symbolicity (p. xii).\"\nBULLET::::2. When we use language, we are used by it as well. Burke held a concept of linguistic relativity similar to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Words set our concepts and opinions, which means people cannot see beyond what their words lead them to believe. This assumption suggests that language exerts a determining influence over people, which means meanwhile people's propositions are often restricted to be polarized by language, because some language cannot express much nuance of opinion.\nBULLET::::3. We humans are choice makers. Agency (sociology) is another key point of dramatism. \"The essence of agency is choice.\" Social actors have the ability of acting out of choices.\nSection::::Key Concepts.\nSection::::Key Concepts.:1. Dramatistic pentad.\nSection::::Key Concepts.:1. Dramatistic pentad.:The Dramatistic Pentad.\nThe Dramatistic Pentad is an instrument used as a set of relational or functional principles that could help us understand what he calls the \u2018cycle cluster of terms\u2019 people use to attribute motive. This pentad is a dissolution to drama. It is parallel with Aristotle's four causes and has a similar correlation to journalists catchism: who, what, when, where, why, and how. This is done through the five key elements of human drama \u2013 act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. The Pentad is a simple tool for seeing and understanding the complexity of a situation. It reveals the nuances and complications of language as symbolic action, which in turn, opens up our perspective. \nBULLET::::- Act: \"What\", what has done. According to Burke, \"the act\" of the Pentad is which \u201cnames what took place, in thought or deed.\u201d\nBULLET::::- Scene: \"When\" and \"Where\". According to Burke, \"the scene\" is defined as \u201cthe background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.\u201d\nBULLET::::- Agent: \"by Whom\", who did it. Burke defines the \"agent\" as \u201cwhat person or kind of person performed the act.\u201d\nBULLET::::- Agency: \"How\", which is associated with methods and technologies. Burke defines the \"agency\" as \u201cwhat instrument or instruments he used.\u201d\nBULLET::::- Purpose: \"Why\", why it happened. This is associate with the motive behind the behavior, which is the main focus of the analysis.\nBULLET::::- \"Attitude\": How to prepare for an act\nIn the 1969 edition of \"Grammar\", Burke added a new element, Attitude, thereby making the pentad a hexad. Attitude means \"the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act.\" \nSection::::Key Concepts.:1. Dramatistic pentad.:The Dramatistic Pentad.:Example of the usage of pentad.\nDavid Ling used the pentad elements to evaluate Senator Edward Kennedy's speech in 1969 to persuade the audiences to see him as a victim of his family curse instead of the one who should be responsible for an accident which caused death of a woman. From Kennedy's statement, Ling recognized several elements from the pentad: \"the scene (the event surrounding the death of the woman), the agent (Kennedy), the act (Kennedy's failure to report immediately the accident), the agency (whatever methods to make such a report), the purpose (to fulfill his legal and moral responsibilities). \" Kennedy denied his relationship with the dead woman, described his survival as a fate, and described the hardness of rescuing the woman at the scene. He pivoted the fact and described it as a circumstance that he couldn't control.\nSection::::Key Concepts.:1. Dramatistic pentad.:The Dramatistic Ratios.\nDramatistic ratios is the \"proportions of one element relative to another in the Dramatism Pentad\", which can be used to find the dominant element in the interaction.\nAny complete statement about motives will offer some kind of answers to the five questions above. While it is important to understand each element of the Pentad on its own, it is more important to understand how the elements work together. This is called a \"ratio\", and there are ten possible ratios within the Pentad. Burke maintained that analyzing the ratios of a speaker's presentation would expose the resources of ambiguity people might exploit to interpret complex problems. The most common ratios used by Burke are Scene-Act and Scene-Agent. When engaged in a dramatistic study, he notes, \"the basic unit of action would be defined as 'the human body in conscious or purposive motion'\", which is an agent acting in a situation.\nSection::::Key Concepts.:2. Identification.\nIdentification is the basic function of sociality, using both positive and negative associations. When there is overlap between two people in terms of their substance, they have identification. On the other hand, division is the lack of overlap between two people in matters of essence. According to Burke, identification is an inevitable, thus both beneficial and detrimental characteristic of language in human relations. Identification has the following features:\nSection::::Key Concepts.:2. Identification.:The chief notion of a \"new rhetoric\".\nExamining Aristotle's principles of rhetoric, Burke points out that the definition of the \"old rhetoric\" is, in essence, persuasion. Correspondingly, Burke proposes a new rhetoric, which discusses several issues, but mainly focuses on the notion of identification. In comparison with \"old\" rhetoric, which stresses on deliberate design, \"new\" rhetoric may include partially \"unconscious\" factors in its appeal.\nBurke's concept of new rhetoric has also been expanded in various academic disciplines. For example, in 2015 philosophers Rutten & Soetaert used the new rhetoric concept to study changing attitudes in regards to education as a way to better understand if Burke's ideas can be applied to this arena.\nBurke's new rhetoric has also been used to understand the women's equality movement, specifically in regards to the education of women and sharing of knowledge through print media. Academic Amlong deconstructed print medias of the 1800s addressing human rights as an aspect of educating women about the women's rights movement.\nSection::::Key Concepts.:2. Identification.:Generated when two people's substances overlap.\nBurke asserts that all things have substance, which he defines as the general nature of something. Identification is a recognized common ground between two people's substances, regarding physical characteristics, talents, occupation, experiences, personality, beliefs, and attitudes. The more substance two people share, the greater the identification. It is used to overcome human division.\nSection::::Key Concepts.:2. Identification.:Can be falsified to result in homophily.\nSometimes the speaker tries to falsely identify..."], "wikipedia-628450": ["Activity theory (AT; ) is an umbrella term for a line of eclectic social sciences theories and research with its roots in the Soviet psychological activity theory pioneered by Lev Vygotsky , Alexei Leont'ev and Sergei Rubinstein. These scholars sought to understand human activities as systemic and socially situated phenomena and to go beyond paradigms of reflexology (the teaching of Vladimir Bekhterev and his followers) and classical conditioning (the teaching of Ivan Pavlov and his school), psychoanalysis and behaviorism. It became one of the major psychological approaches in the former USSR, being widely used in both theoretical and applied psychology, and in education, professional training, ergonomics, social psychology and work psychology.\nActivity theory is more of a descriptive meta-theory or framework than a predictive theory. It considers an entire work/activity system (including teams, organizations, etc.) beyond just one actor or user. It accounts for environment, history of the person, culture, role of the artifact, motivations, and complexity of real-life activity. One of the strengths of AT is that it bridges the gap between the individual subject and the social reality\u2014it studies both through the mediating activity. The unit of analysis in AT is the concept of object-oriented, collective and culturally mediated human activity, or \"activity system\". This system includes the object (or objective), subject, mediating artifacts (signs and tools), rules, community and division of labor. The motive for the activity in AT is created through the tensions and contradictions within the elements of the system. According to ethnographer Bonnie Nardi, a leading theorist in AT, activity theory \"focuses on practice, which obviates the need to distinguish 'applied' from 'pure' science\u2014understanding everyday practice in the real world is the very objective of scientific practice. ... The object of activity theory is to understand the unity of consciousness and activity.\" Sometimes called \"Cultural-Historical Activity Theory\", this approach is particularly useful for studying a group that exists \"largely in virtual form, its communications mediated largely through electronic and printed texts.\"\nAT is particularly useful as a lens in qualitative research methodologies (e.g., ethnography, case study). AT provides a method of understanding and analyzing a phenomenon, finding patterns and making inferences across interactions, describing phenomena and presenting phenomena through a built-in language and rhetoric. A particular activity is a goal-directed or purposeful interaction of a subject with an object through the use of tools. These tools are exteriorized forms of mental processes manifested in constructs, whether physical or psychological. AT recognizes the internalization and externalization of cognitive processes involved in the use of tools, as well as the transformation or development that results from the interaction."], "wikipedia-6518342": ["Formative assessment, formative evaluation, formative feedback, or assessment for learning, including \"diagnostic testing\", is a range of formal and informal assessment procedures conducted by teachers during the learning process in order to modify teaching and learning activities to improve student attainment. It typically involves qualitative feedback (rather than scores) for both student and teacher that focuses on the details of content and performance. It is commonly contrasted with summative assessment, which seeks to monitor educational outcomes, often for purposes of external accountability.\n\nFormative assessment serves several purposes:\nBULLET::::- to provide feedback for teachers to modify subsequent learning activities and experiences;\nBULLET::::- to identify and remediate group or individual deficiencies;\nBULLET::::- to move focus away from achieving grades and onto learning processes, in order to increase self efficacy and reduce the negative impact of extrinsic motivation;\nBULLET::::- to improve students' metacognitive awareness of how they learn.\nBULLET::::- \"frequent, ongoing assessment allows both for fine-tuning of instruction and student focus on progress.\""], "wikipedia-6157683": ["In philosophy, a theory of everything or ToE is an ultimate, all-encompassing explanation or description of nature or reality. Adopting the term from physics, where the search for a theory of everything is ongoing, philosophers have discussed the viability of the concept and analyzed its properties and implications. Among the questions to be addressed by a philosophical theory of everything are: \"Why is reality understandable?\" \"Why are the laws of nature as they are?\" \"Why is there anything at all?\"\n\nThe \"system building\" style of metaphysics attempts to answer \"all\" the important questions in a coherent way, providing a complete picture of the world. Plato and Aristotle could be said to be early examples of comprehensive systems. In the early modern period (17th and 18th centuries), the system-building \"scope\" of philosophy is often linked to the rationalist \"method\" of philosophy, that is the technique of deducing the nature of the world by pure \"a priori\" reason. Examples from the early modern period include Leibniz's monadology, Descartes's dualism, and Spinoza's monism. Hegel's absolute idealism and Whitehead's process philosophy were later systems. At present, work is underway on the structural-systematic philosophy (SSP), to which the following books are devoted: Lorenz B. Puntel, \"Structure and Being\" (2008; translation of \"Struktur und Sein\", 2006) and \"Being and God\" (2011; translation of \"Sein und Gott\", 2010) and Alan White, \"Toward a Philosophical Theory of Everything\" (2014). The SSP makes no claims to finality; it aims to be the best systematic philosophy currently available.\n\nOther philosophers do not believe philosophy should aim so high. Some scientists think a more mathematical approach than philosophy is needed for a ToE, for instance Stephen Hawking wrote in \"A Brief History of Time\" that even if we had a ToE, it would necessarily be a set of equations.
