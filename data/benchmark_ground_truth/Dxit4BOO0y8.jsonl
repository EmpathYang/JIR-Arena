Early mouse cursor tracking systems began by logging click events only (coordinates and timestamp) and using these events to assess what information users were interested in. However, it was soon realized that click data provide an incomplete picture of user interaction. Click data informed researchers of a users' primary focus of attention, or their end choice. However, a mouse click is often preceded by several interactions such as scrolling, hovers, movements, etc. and thus can lead to a better overall understanding of the user's thought process.

Targeted advertising is focused on certain traits and the consumers who are likely to have a strong preference will receive the message instead of those who have no interest and whose preferences do not match a product's attribute. This eliminates wastage.\n\nGoogle uses its display network to track what users are looking at and to gather information about them. When a user goes onto a website that uses the google display network it will send a cookie to Google, showing information on the user, what he or she searched, where they are from, found by the IP address, and then builds a profile around them, allowing google to easily target ads to the user more specifically. For example, if a user went onto promotional companies' websites often, that sell promotional pens, Google will gather data from the user such as age, gender, location, and other demographic information as well as information on the websites visited, the user will then be put into a category of promotional products, allowing Google to easily display ads on websites the user visits relating to promotional products. these types of adverts are also called behavioral advertisements as they track the website behavior of the user and displays ads based on previous pages or searched terms.", "Behavioral targeting is centred around the activity/actions of users, and is more easily achieved on web pages. Information from browsing websites can be collected from data mining, which finds patterns in users search history. Advertisers using this method believe it produces ads that will be more relevant to users, thus leading consumers be more likely influenced by them. If a consumer was frequently searching for plane ticket prices, the targeting system would recognise this and start showing related adverts across unrelated websites, such as airfare deals on Facebook. Its advantage is that it can target individual's interests, rather than target groups of people whose interests may vary.\nWhen a consumer visits a web site, the pages they visit, the amount of time they view each page, the links they click on, the searches they make, and the things that they interact with, allow sites to collect that data, and other factors, to create a 'profile' that links to that visitor's web browser. As a result, site publishers can use this data to create defined audience segments based upon visitors that have similar profiles.\nWhen visitors return to a specific site or a network of sites using the same web browser, those profiles can be used to allow marketers and advertisers to position their online ads and messaging in front of those visitors who exhibit a greater level of interest and intent for the products and services being offered. Behavioral targeting has emerged as one of the main technologies used to increase the efficiency and profits of digital marketing and advertisements, as media providers are able to provide individual users with highly relevant advertisements. On the theory that properly targeted ads and messaging will fetch more consumer interest, publishers can charge a premium for behaviorally targeted ads and marketers can achieve", "Behavioral advertising is the most common form of targeting used online. Internet cookies are sent back and forth between an internet server and the browser, that allows a user to be identified or to track their progressions. Cookies provide detail on what pages a consumer visits, the amount of time spent viewing each page, the links clicked on; and searches and interactions made. From this information, the cookie issuer gathers an understanding of the user's browsing tendencies and interests generating a profile. Analysing the profile, advertisers are able to create defined audience segments based upon users with similar returned similar information, hence profiles. Tailored advertising is then placed in front of the consumer based upon what organisations working on behalf of the advertisers assume are the interests of the consumer. These advertisements have been formatted so as to appear on pages and in front of users that it would most likely appeal to based on their profiles. For example, under behavioral targeting if a user is known to have recently visited a number of automotive shopping and comparison sites based on the data recorded by cookies stored on the user's computer, the user can then be served automotive related advertisements when visiting other sites.", "The user's preferences and interests are visible through their clickstream and their behavioral profile is generated."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. Superseding the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements pertaining to the processing of personal data of individuals (formally called \"data subjects\" in the GDPR) inside the EEA, and applies to any enterprise established in the EEA or\u2014regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship\u2014that is processing the personal information of data subjects inside the EEA.\n\nControllers of personal data must put in place \"appropriate technical and organisational measures\" to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using pseudonymization or full anonymization where appropriate), and use the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the datasets are not publicly available without explicit, informed consent, and cannot be used to identify a subject without additional information (which must stored separately). No personal data may be processed unless this processing is done under a lawful basis specified by the regulation, or unless the data controller or processor has received an unambiguous and individualized affirmation of consent from the data subject. The data subject has the right to revoke this consent at any time.\n\nA processor of personal data must clearly disclose any data collection, declare the lawful basis and purpose for data processing, and state how long data is being retained and if it is being shared with any third parties or outside of the EEA. Data subjects have the right to request a portable copy of the data collected by a processor in a common format, and the right to have their data erased under certain circumstances. Public authorities, and businesses whose core activities centre around regular or systematic processing of personal data, are required to employ a \"data protection officer\" (DPO), who is responsible for managing compliance with the GDPR. Businesses must report any data breaches within 72 hours if they have an adverse effect on user privacy. In some cases, violators of the GDPR may be fined up to \u20ac20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater.", "A data subject must be able to transfer personal data from one electronic processing system to and into another, without being prevented from doing so by the data controller. Data that has been sufficiently anonymised is excluded, but data that has been only de-identified but remains possible to link to the individual in question, such as by providing the relevant identifier, is not. In practice however providing such identifiers can be challenging, such as in the case of Apple's Siri, where voice and transcript data is stored with a personal identifier which the manufacturer restricts access to, or in online behavioural targeting, which relies heavily on device fingerprints that can be challenging to capture, send and verify.\n\nTo be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the data controller must implement measures which meet the principles of data protection by design and by default. Article 25 requires data protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Such measures include pseudonymising personal data, by the controller, as soon as possible (Recital 78). It is the responsibility and the liability of the data controller to implement effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities even if the processing is carried out by a data processor on behalf of the controller (Recital 74).\n\nWhen data is collected, data subjects must be clearly informed about the extent of data collection, the legal basis for processing of personal data, how long data is retained, if data is being transferred to a third-party and/or outside the EU, and any automated decision-making that is made on a solely algorithmic basis.

The GDPR\u2019s protections can be found \u2013 albeit in weaker, less prescriptive forms \u2013 in U.S. privacy laws and in Federal Trade Commission settlements with companies.\nDespite having had at least two years to prepare and do so, many companies and websites changed their privacy policies and features worldwide directly prior to GDPR's implementation, and customarily provided email and other notifications discussing these changes. This was criticised for resulting in a fatiguing number of communications, while experts noted that some reminder emails incorrectly asserted that new consent for data processing had to be obtained for when the GDPR took effect (any previously-obtained consent to processing is valid as long as it met the regulation's requirements). Phishing scams also emerged using falsified versions of GDPR-related emails, and it was also argued that some GDPR notice emails may have actually been sent in violation of anti-spam laws. In March 2019, a provider of compliance software found that many websites operated by EU member state governments contained embedded tracking from ad technology providers.\nResearch indicates that approximately 25% of software vulnerabilities have GDPR implications. Since Article 33 emphasizes breaches, not bugs, security experts advise companies to invest in processes and capabilities to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, including Coordinated vulnerability disclosure processes.\nOn the effective date, some international websites began to block EU users entirely (including Instapaper, Unroll.me, and Tribune Publishing-owned newspapers, such as the \"Chicago Tribune\" and the \"Los Angeles Times\") or redirect them to stripped-down versions of their services (in the case of National Public Radio and \"USA Today\") with limited functionality and/or no advertising, in order to remove their liabilities. Some companies, such as Klout, and several online video games, ceased operations entirely to coincide with its implementation, citing the GDPR as a burden on their continued operations, especially due to the business model of the former.

However, specific details on web tracking may need supplementary sources for deeper analysis.", "wikipedia-38104075": ["The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individual citizens of the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. Superseding the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements pertaining to the processing of personal data of individuals (formally called \"data subjects\" in the GDPR) inside the EEA, and applies to any enterprise established in the EEA or\u2014regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship\u2014that is processing the personal information of data subjects inside the EEA.\n\nControllers of personal data must put in place \"appropriate technical and organisational measures\" to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using pseudonymization or full anonymization where appropriate), and use the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the datasets are not publicly available without explicit, informed consent, and cannot be used to identify a subject without additional information (which must stored separately). No personal data may be processed unless this processing is done under a lawful basis specified by the regulation, or unless the data controller or processor has received an unambiguous and individualized affirmation of consent from the data subject. The data subject has the right to revoke this consent at any time.\n\nA processor of personal data must clearly disclose any data collection, declare the lawful basis and purpose for data processing, and state how long data is being retained and if it is being shared with any third parties or outside of the EEA. Data subjects have the right to request a portable copy of the data collected by a processor in a common format, and the right to have their data erased under certain circumstances. Public authorities, and businesses whose core activities centre around regular or systematic processing of personal data, are required to employ a \"data protection officer\" (DPO), who is responsible for managing compliance with the GDPR. Businesses must report any data breaches within 72 hours if they have an adverse effect on user privacy. In some cases, violators of the GDPR may be fined up to \u20ac20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater.", "A data subject must be able to transfer personal data from one electronic processing system to and into another, without being prevented from doing so by the data controller. Data that has been sufficiently anonymised is excluded, but data that has been only de-identified but remains possible to link to the individual in question, such as by providing the relevant identifier, is not. In practice however providing such identifiers can be challenging, such as in the case of Apple's Siri, where voice and transcript data is stored with a personal identifier which the manufacturer restricts access to, or in online behavioural targeting, which relies heavily on device fingerprints that can be challenging to capture, send and verify.\nBoth data being 'provided' by the data subject and data being 'observed', such as about behaviour, are included. In addition, the data must be provided by the controller in a structured and commonly used standard electronic format. The right to data portability is provided by Article 20 of the GDPR.\nWhen data is collected, data subjects must be clearly informed about the extent of data collection, the legal basis for processing of personal data, how long data is retained, if data is being transferred to a third-party and/or outside the EU, and any automated decision-making that is made on a solely algorithmic basis. Data subjects must be informed of their privacy rights under the GDPR, including their right to revoke consent to data processing at any time, their right to view their personal data and access an overview of how it is being processed, their right to obtain a portable copy of the stored data, the right to erasure of data under certain circumstances, the right to contest any automated decision-making that was made on a solely algorithmic basis, and the right to file complaints with a Data Protection Authority. As such, the data subject must also be provided with contact details for the data controller and their designated data protection officer, where applicable.\nData protection impact assessments (Article 35) have to be conducted when specific risks occur to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Risk assessment and mitigation is required and prior approval of the data protection authorities is required for high risks.\nArticle 25 requires data protection to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Privacy settings must therefore be set at a high level by default, and technical and procedural measures should be taken by the controller to make sure that the processing, throughout the whole processing lifecycle, complies with the regulation. Controllers should also implement mechanisms to ensure that personal data is not processed unless necessary for each specific purpose.\nA report by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security elaborates on what needs to be done to achieve privacy and data protection by default. It specifies that encryption and decryption operations must be carried out locally, not by remote service, because both keys and data must remain in the power of the data owner if any privacy is to be achieved. The report specifies that outsourced data storage on remote clouds is practical and relatively safe if only the data owner, not the cloud service, holds the decryption keys.\nThe GDPR refers to pseudonymisation as a process that is required when data is stored (as an alternative to the other option of complete data anonymisation) to transform personal data in such a way that the resulting data cannot be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information. An example is encryption, which renders the original data unintelligible and the process cannot be reversed without access to the correct decryption key. The GDPR requires for the additional information (such as the decryption key) to be kept separately from the pseudonymised data.\nAnother example of pseudonymisation is tokenisation, which is a non-mathematical approach to protecting data at rest that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes, referred to as tokens. While the tokens have no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value, they allow for specific data to be fully or partially visible for processing and analytics while sensitive information is kept hidden. Tokenisation does not alter the type or length of data, which means it can be processed by legacy systems such as databases that may be sensitive to data length and type. This also requires much fewer computational resources to process and less storage space in databases than traditionally-encrypted data.\nPseudonymisation is recommended to reduce the risks to the concerned data subjects and also to help controllers and processors to meet their data protection obligations (Recital 28).\nArticle 33 states the data controller is under a legal obligation to notify the supervisory authority without undue delay unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the individuals. There is a maximum of 72 hours after becoming aware of the data breach to make the report. Individuals have to be notified if a high risk of an adverse impact is determined (Article 34). In addition, the data processor will have to notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach (Article 33).\nHowever, the notice to data subjects is not required if the data controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption (Article 34)."], "wikipedia-59758426": ["The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation that specifies standards for data protection and electronic privacy in the European Economic Area, and the rights of European citizens to control the processing and distribution of personally-identifiable information."], "wikipedia-3421940": ["The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was set into place on 14 April 2016, but the current date of enforcement is set to be on 25 May 2018.

The concept became widely known as the \"tragedy of the commons\" over a century later due to an article written by the American ecologist and philosopher Garrett Hardin in 1968. In this modern economic context, commons is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as atmosphere, oceans, rivers, fish stocks, roads and highways, or even an office refrigerator.", "Libertarians and classical liberals cite the tragedy of the commons as an example of what happens when Lockean property rights to homestead resources are prohibited by a government. They argue that the solution to the tragedy of the commons is to allow individuals to take over the property rights of a resource, that is, to privatize it.\nIn England, this solution was attempted in the Inclosure Acts.\nSection::::Solutions.:Governmental solutions.:Regulation.\nIn a typical example, governmental regulations can limit the amount of a common good that is available for use by any individual. Permit systems for extractive economic activities including mining, fishing, hunting, livestock raising and timber extraction are examples of this approach. Similarly, limits to pollution are examples of governmental intervention on behalf of the commons. This idea is used by the United Nations Moon Treaty, Outer Space Treaty and Law of the Sea Treaty as well as the UNESCO World Heritage Convention which involves the international law principle that designates some areas or resources the Common Heritage of Mankind.\nIn Hardin's essay, he proposed that the solution to the problem of overpopulation must be based on \"mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon\" and result in \"relinquishing the freedom to breed\". Hardin discussed this topic further in a 1979 book, \"Managing the Commons,\" co-written with John A. Baden. He framed this prescription in terms of needing to restrict the \"reproductive right\", to safeguard all other rights. Several countries have a variety of population control laws in place.\nGerman historian Joachim Radkau thought Hardin advocates strict management of common goods via increased government involvement or international regulation bodies. An asserted impending \"tragedy of the commons\" is frequently warned of as a consequence of the adoption of policies which restrict private property and espouse expansion of public property."], "wikipedia-8884816": ["The CC\u2013PP Game is used to explain how individuals utilize public goods, specifically scarce natural resources.

According to Lloyd, \"If a person puts more cattle into his own field, the amount of the subsistence which they consume is all deducted from that which was at the command, of his original stock; and if, before, there was no more than a sufficiency of pasture, he reaps no benefit from the additional cattle, what is gained in one way being lost in another. But if he puts more cattle on a common, the food which they consume forms a deduction which is shared between all the cattle, as well that of others as his own, in proportion to their number, and only a small part of it is taken from his own cattle\".\nThe template of the tragedy of the commons can be used to understand myriad problems, including various forms of resource depletion.

This research has continued through the 2000s and to the present. The general findings in the research are that the correlation is not one to one, but there is a relationship between eye and mouse movements, which, in turn suggests mouse movements can in fact be used to determine a user's focus of attention. More recent research has shown that the correlation depends strongly on the user behavior at that time, such as whether the user is reading with the mouse, moving it to perform a click, or leaving it idle. Furthermore, the mouse position actually correlates better with past eye-gaze positions, meaning that people will typically look somewhere before moving their mouse there about 700ms later. Generally, tracking mouse positions can lead to a vast improvement to understanding the user compared with relying on mouse clicks only. In other words, click data informed researchers of a users' primary focus of attention, or their end choice. However, looking at all of the mouse movements can inform the researcher to other options that were of interest to the user but were not selected by clicking, which can lead to better overall understanding of the user's thought process."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

For example, one such form of this tracking uses audio beacons, or inaudible sounds, emitted by one device and recognized through the microphone of the other device.\nThis form of tracking is utilized primarily by technology companies and advertisers who use this information to piece together a cohesive profile of the user. These profiles inform and predict the type of advertisements the user receives.\nOne such tactic for cross-device tracking is called browser fingerprinting, and occurs when browsers, which are modifiable to the users\u2019 tastes, produce a unique signal that companies or advertisers can use to single out the user. Browser fingerprinting has been a cause for concern because of its effectiveness and also since it does not allow for users to opt-out of the tracking.\nAnother tactic used by Google is called AdID and works on smartphones in tandem with cookies on a user\u2019s computer to track behavior across devices.\nNow, cross-device tracking has evolved into a new, radical form of surveillance technology which enables users to be tracked across multiple devices, including smartphones, TVs, and personal computers through the use of audio beacons, or inaudible sound, emitted by one device and recognized through the microphone of the other device, usually a smartphone.\nApplications such as Silverpush, Shopkick, and Lisnr are part of an \u201cultrasonic side-channel\u201d in which the app, often unbeknownst to the user, intercepts ultrasonic signals emitted from the user\u2019s environment, such as from a TV, to track which advertisements the user has heard and how long the person listened to them.\nBULLET::::- Silverpush\u00ad\u00ad\u2013\u2013the leading company utilizing this technology\u2013\u2013patented software enabling them to track TV ads based on audio stream above\nBULLET::::- Shopkick, another popular application, gives discounts to users who shop at stores which emit these ultrasonic beacons, allowing them to create a profile of the user\nBULLET::::- Lisnr utilizes a user\u2019s location data in tandem with ultrasonic beacons to give users coupons related to their activities", "down on Nomi, a company that scans the MAC addresses of customers\u2019 phones in stores.

The FTC has also cracked down on companies like Compete, a browser toolbar, because it decrypted users\u2019 personal information on the internet, putting users at risk. Lastly, in cases during which deception is used to engage in surveillance, the FTC has investigated private investigators, who surveil individuals on another person\u2019s behalf.

Dynamic remarketing can improve the targeted advertising as the ads are able to include the products or services that the consumers have previously viewed on the advertisers' website within the ads.\n\nGoogle uses its display network to track what users are looking at and to gather information about them. When a user goes onto a website that uses the google display network it will send a cookie to Google, showing information on the user, what he or she searched, where they are from, found by the IP address, and then builds a profile around them, allowing google to easily target ads to the user more specifically. For example, if a user went onto promotional companies' websites often, that sell promotional pens, Google will gather data from the user such as age, gender, location, and other demographic information as well as information on the websites visited, the user will then be put into a category of promotional products, allowing Google to easily display ads on websites the user visits relating to promotional products. these types of adverts are also called behavioral advertisements as they track the website behavior of the user and displays ads based on previous pages or searched terms.\n\nSocial media targeting is a form of targeted advertising, that uses general targeting attributes such as geotargeting, behavioral targeting, socio-psychographic targeting, and gathers the information that consumers have provided on each social media platform. According to the media users' view history, customers who are interested in the stuff will be automatically targeted by the advertisementa of certain products or service. For example, on Facebook if a consumer has liked clothing pages they will receive ads based on those page likes and the area they have said they live in, this allows advertisers to target very specific consumers as they can specify cities and interests to their needs. Social media also creates profiles of the consumer and only needs to look one place, one the users' profile to find all interests and 'likes'.\n\nE.g. Facebook lets advertisers target using broad characteristics like Gender, Age, and Location. Furthermore, they allow more narrow targeting based on Demographics, Behavior, and Interests (see a comprehensive list of Facebook's different types of targeting options).\n\nThe Facebook recruitment advertisement is offers wider and cost-effective research compared with newspaper advertisement. For instance, the recruitment was conducted by the United States in 2015 to recruit survey participant about smokers. The company recruited smokers through people's profile information, such as location, area of interest, ages, and occupation. They yielded 56,621 viewed within the 18-day campaign. The 1.97% of viewer(1121) clicked the advertisement to the recruitment poster at a cost of $1.51 per a survey, 37.7% of participants(423) finished the full survey. Also, when people were recruited it took way less time because company already have collected people's information through Facebook. On the other hand, the newspaper recruited 30 participants in 3-day advertisement, but only 10 out of 30 participants completed the survey. The cost for recruitment was $40.80 per one complete survey.

The terms \"mouse cursor tracking\" and \"demographics\" can be explained using Wikipedia or similar sources.  \n\n- **Mouse cursor tracking** refers to recording the movement and behavior of a user's mouse (or touchpad) on a screen, such as speed, clicks, and hover patterns.  \n- **Demographics** are statistical data about groups of people, such as age, gender, or location.  \n\nWikipedia can help clarify how cursor tracking might predict demographics by analyzing behavioral patterns (e.g., younger users may move the mouse faster). However, deeper technical details may require additional sources.", "wikipedia-33924304": ["Mouse tracking (also known as cursor tracking) is the use of software to collect users' mouse cursor positions on the computer. This goal is to automatically gather richer information about what people are doing, typically to improve the design of an interface. Often this is done on the Web and can supplement eye tracking in some situations.\n\nMore recently, the term mouse tracking has been expanded even more to develop a much broader area of research in helping understand the human-computer interaction (HCI). This development began with eye tracking. While eye tracking has been around since the 1800s, it was not used in HCI until the 1980, primarily to help answer questions about how users search for commands in computer menus and to develop systems to help disabled users. More recently, eye tracking has been used in usability testing on web pages to understand a user's point of focus as well as test the usability of different features of a site, such as dropdown menus. This information can influence Web design so it meets the researcher's goals yet is user friendly.\n\nThe problem with using eye tracking in usability testing is the required hardware and then expense. Additionally, eye tracking is limited to small sample sizes and abnormal browsing environments. Mouse tracking, on the other hand, is inexpensive and the data can be collected from any computer. It is in this capacity that mouse tracking was re-invented in HCI research. Eye tracking researchers in the late 1990s noticed patterns between the eye and mouse movements. Based on these findings, researchers who had been tracking click data realized there might be more to learn from the mouse. In 2001 Mon-Chu Chen, John Anderson, and Myeong-Ho Sohn at Carnegie Mellon University, began explicitly investigating whether tracking mouse movements could be used as a proxy for tracking eye movements. This research has continued through the 2000s and to the present. The general findings in the research are that the correlation is not one to one, but there is a relationship between eye and mouse movements, which, in turn suggests mouse movements can in fact be used to determine a user's focus of attention. More recent research has shown that the correlation depends strongly on the user behavior at that time, such as whether the user is reading with the mouse, moving it to perform a click, or leaving it idle. Furthermore, the mouse position actually correlates better with past eye-gaze positions, meaning that people will typically look somewhere before moving their mouse there about 700ms later. Generally, tracking mouse positions can lead to a vast improvement to understanding the user compared with relying on mouse clicks only. In other words, click data informed researchers of a users' primary focus of attention, or their end choice. However, looking at all of the mouse movements can inform the researcher to other options that were of interest to the user but were not selected by clicking, which can lead to better overall understanding of the user's thought process."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The impact of context effects is considered to be part of top-down design. The concept is supported by the theoretical approach to perception known as constructive perception. Context effects can impact our daily lives in many ways such as word recognition, learning abilities, memory, and object recognition. It can have an extensive effect on marketing and consumer decisions. For example, research has shown that the comfort level of the floor that shoppers are standing on while reviewing products can affect their assessments of product's quality, leading to higher assessments if the floor is comfortable and lower ratings if it is uncomfortable. Because of effects such as this, context effects are currently studied predominantly in marketing.\n\nWhen context effects occur, individuals are using environmental cues perceived while examining the stimuli in order to help analyze it. In other words, individuals often make relative decisions that are influenced by the environment or previous exposure to objects. These decisions may be greatly influenced by these external forces and alter the way individuals view an object. For example, research has shown that people rank television commercials as either good or bad in relation to their enjoyment levels of the show during which the commercials are presented. The more they like or dislike the show the more likely they are to rate the commercials shown during the show more positively or negatively (respectively).

The above studies demonstrate that certain cognitive and motor control mechanisms are embodied and reflected, to some extent, in our mouse cursor movements and online interactions.

This additive Gaussian noise is also applied to the time offsets, to ensure that the distorted trajectory has no duplicated times. The amount of adversarial noise applied to each programmatic event ranges randomly from 0 to $\\sigma$. We ensure that distorted points (both coordinates and time) are always positive values, in line with regular mouse movement data. In this experiment, we study the impact of $\\sigma$ in classification performance. Theoretically, a random classifier should achieve an AUC score of $0.5$ for a two-class classification problem. Therefore, we expect to see a degradation in classification performance with regard to the previous experiments. Given that the BiGRU outperformed the RF model and relies only on raw mouse movements, we only challenge the BiGRU model in these experiments.

Indeed, by scrambling both spatial and temporal information from a mouse cursor trajectory we are effectively signaling a seemingly arbitrary and jittery movement. To validate further the validity of this adversarial noise, we re-trained our BiGRU model with distorted mouse data, using the same configuration from our previous experiments (\\autoref{sssec:rnn_model}).

With every click or online interaction, digital footprints are created and logged, providing a detailed record of a person's online activity that can be used for market segmentation, targeted advertising, but also for more privacy-invasive applications like user profiling. Early mouse cursor tracking systems began by logging click events only (coordinates and timestamp) and using these events to assess what information users were interested in. However, it was soon realized that click data provide an incomplete picture of user interaction. Click data informed researchers of a users' primary focus of attention, or their end choice. However, a mouse click is often preceded by several interactions such as scrolling, hovers, movements, etc. and thus can lead to a better overall understanding of the user's thought process.

However, a survey of people with many different religious beliefs indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, and another study, conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that most people would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it. Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion. Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on science, has stated that the Catholic Church would be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly.\nContact with extraterrestrial intelligence would not be completely inconsequential for religion. The Peters study showed that most non-religious people, and a significant minority of religious people, believe that the world could face a religious crisis, even if their own beliefs were unaffected. Contact with extraterrestrial intelligence would be most likely to cause a problem for western religions, in particular traditionalist Christianity, because of the geocentric nature of western faiths. The discovery of extraterrestrial life would not contradict basic conceptions of God, however, and seeing that science has challenged established dogma in the past, for example with the theory of evolution, it is likely that existing religions will adapt similarly to the new circumstances. Douglas Vakoch argues that it is not likely that the discovery of extraterrestrial life will impact religious beliefs. In the view of Musso, a global religious crisis would be unlikely even for Abrahamic faiths, as the studies of himself and others on Christianity, the most \"anthropocentric\" religion, see no conflict between that religion and the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence. In addition, the cultural and religious values of extraterrestrial species would likely be shared over centuries if contact is to occur by radio, meaning that rather than causing a huge shock to humanity, such information would be viewed much as archaeologists and historians view ancient artifacts and texts.\nFunes speculates that a decipherable message from extraterrestrial intelligence could initiate an interstellar exchange of knowledge in various disciplines, including whatever religions an extraterrestrial civilization may host. Billingham further suggests that an extremely advanced and friendly extraterrestrial civilization might put an end to present-day religious conflicts and lead to greater religious toleration worldwide. On the other hand, Jill Tarter puts forward the view that contact with extraterrestrial intelligence might eliminate religion as we know it and introduce humanity to an all-encompassing faith. Vakoch doubts that humans would be inclined to adopt extraterrestrial religions, telling \"ABC News\" \"I think religion meets very human needs, and unless extraterrestrials can provide a replacement for it, I don't think religion is going to go away,\" and adding, \"if there are incredibly advanced civilizations with a belief in God, I don't think Richard Dawkins will start believing.\"", "Extraterrestrial technology could have profound impacts on the nature of human culture and civilization.

Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.\n\nMichaud suggests that humanity could be impacted by an influx of extraterrestrial science and technology in the same way that medieval European scholars were impacted by the knowledge of Arab scientists. Humanity might at first revere the knowledge as having the potential to advance the human species, and might even feel inferior to the extraterrestrial species, but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and more intimate knowledge of the science, technology, and other cultural developments of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.\n\nThe discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence would have various impacts on biology and astrobiology. The discovery of extraterrestrial life in any form, intelligent or non-intelligent, would give humanity greater insight into the nature of life on Earth and would improve the conception of how the tree of life is organized. Human biologists could learn about extraterrestrial biochemistry and observe how it differs from that found on Earth. This knowledge could help human civilization to learn which aspects of life are common throughout the universe and which are specific to Earth.\n\nSection::::Further implications of contact.:Ecological and biological-warfare impacts.\nAn extraterrestrial civilization might bring to Earth pathogens or invasive life forms that do not harm its own biosphere. Alien pathogens could decimate the human population, which would have no immunity to them, or they might use terrestrial livestock or plants as hosts, causing indirect harm to humans. Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them.\n\nOn the other hand, pathogens and invasive species of extraterrestrial origin might differ enough from terrestrial organisms in their biology to have no adverse effects. Furthermore, pathogens and parasites on Earth are generally suited to only a small and exclusive set of environments, to which extraterrestrial pathogens would have had no opportunity to adapt.\n\nIf an extraterrestrial civilization bearing malice towards humanity gained sufficient knowledge of terrestrial biology and weaknesses in the immune systems of terrestrial biota, it might be able to create extremely potent biological weapons.

To validate further the validity of this adversarial noise, we re-trained our BiGRU model with distorted mouse data, using the same configuration from our previous experiments (\\autoref{sssec:rnn_model}). Now each mouse sequence is distorted according to a random uniform distribution $\\sigma \\sim \\mathcal{U}(0,1)$, which means that some coordinates are preserved ($\\sigma=0$) whereas others are more distorted ($\\sigma=1$). The results are shown in \\autoref{tbl:adversarial-retrain}. As can be observed, the model achieves worse performance than the model trained on the original, non-distorted data, sometimes by a large margin. This was especially so for the age classifier. We conclude that the proposed adversarial noise technique is a robust countermeasure against the neural net used as profiling mechanism via mouse cursor tracking."], "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/12": ["Several works have investigated closely the utility of mouse cursor data in web search~\\cite{Arapakis:2016:PUE:2911451.2911505, 8010344, Liu:2015:DUD:2766462.2767721}\nand web page usability evaluation~\\cite{Arroyo:2006:CPE:1125451.1125529, Atterer:2006:KUM:1135777.1135811, Leiva:2011:RWD:2037373.2037467},\ntwo of the most prominent use cases of this technology.\nMouse biometrics is another active research area that has recently shown how to identify an individual\nby analyzing their mouse movements in controlled settings~\\cite{Kratky18_biom, Lu17_biom}.\nThe construct of attention has nowadays become the common currency on the Web.\nObjective measurements of attentional processes are increasingly sought after by the media industry,\nto explain or predict user behavior.\nWith every click or online interaction, digital footprints are created and logged,\nproviding a detailed record of a person's online activity that can be used for market segmentation, targeted advertising,\nbut also for more privacy-invasive applications like user profiling.\nEarly mouse cursor tracking systems began by logging click events only (coordinates and timestamp)\nand using these events to assess what information users were interested in.\nHowever, it was soon realized that click data provide an incomplete picture of user interaction.\nClick data informed researchers of a users' primary focus of attention, or their end choice.\nHowever, a mouse click is often preceded by several interactions such as scrolling, hovers, movements, etc.\nand thus can lead to a better overall understanding of the user's thought process.\nThis way, mouse cursor tracking systems began to incorporate such fine-grained within-page interactions to create richer user models.\nIn what follows, we review research efforts that have focused on mouse cursor analysis\nto infer user interest, visual attention, emotions, and demographic variables like gender or age, on a desktop setting."], "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/35": ["Our analysis corroborates this account and demonstrates that, through a very simple machine learning implementation, we can infer people's gender or age inadvertently. We do not argue, however, that mouse tracking should be removed from any website, as it may be a valuable data source for various application scenarios. Rather, we find it disconcerting that currently there is no way for end-users to opt-out easily. The work presented here serves a dual purpose. First, it aims at raising awareness on the emerging privacy threats in the online world and exposes some of the unaccounted ---yet sizeable risks--- of tracking technologies. Even when dealing with a seemingly harmless browser activity logging practice, such as the collection of mouse cursor coordinates, a third party can mine this data to uncover personally identifiable information about the users. Second, with this work we intend to give control back to the users over their (mouse) data. We are certainly not the first ones in aiming at this goal, though, to the best of our knowledge, our proposed adversarial noise technique is the first countermeasure against user profiling based on mouse cursor tracking.

Yes  \n2. Wikipedia pages on topics like \"Random sampling,\" \"Random assignment,\" or \"Randomized controlled trials\" often explain common randomization methods (e.g., random number generators, lottery systems, or algorithmic shuffling). While the exact method for this specific query might not be detailed, Wikipedia could provide general principles of randomization applicable to distributing queries among participants.", "wikipedia-6838326": ["Ghost Leg (), known in Japan as or in Korea as Sadaritagi (\uc0ac\ub2e4\ub9ac\ud0c0\uae30, literally \"ladder climbing\"), is a method of lottery designed to create random pairings between two sets of any number of things, as long as the number of elements in each set is the same. This is often used to distribute things among people, where the number of things distributed is the same as the number of people. For instance, chores or prizes could be assigned fairly and randomly this way.\nIt consists of vertical lines with horizontal lines connecting two adjacent vertical lines scattered randomly along their length; the horizontal lines are called \"legs\". The number of vertical lines equals the number of people playing, and at the bottom of each line there is an item - a thing that will be paired with a player. The general rule for playing this game is: choose a line on the top, and follow this line downwards. When a horizontal line is encountered, follow it to get to another vertical line and continue downwards. Repeat this procedure until reaching the end of the vertical line. Then the player is given the thing written at the bottom of the line.\nIf the elements written above the Ghost Leg are treated as a sequence, and after the Ghost Leg is used, the same elements are written at the bottom, then the starting sequence has been transformed to another permutation. Hence, Ghost Leg can be treated as a kind of permuting operator.\nSection::::Process.\nAs an example, consider assigning roles in a play to actors.\nBULLET::::1. To start with, the two sets are enumerated horizontally across a board. The actors' names would go on top, and the roles on the bottom. Then, vertical lines are drawn connecting each actor with the role directly below it.\nBULLET::::2. The names of the actors and/or roles are then concealed so that people do not know which actor is on which line, or which role is on which line.\nBULLET::::3. Next, each actor adds a leg to the board. Each leg must connect two adjacent vertical lines, and must not touch any other horizontal line.\nBULLET::::4. Once this is done, a path is traced from top of each vertical line to the bottom. As you follow the line down, if you come across a leg, you must follow it to the adjacent vertical line on the left or right, then resume tracing down. You continue until you reach the bottom of a vertical line, and the top item you started from is now paired with the bottom item you ended on.\nAnother process involves creating the ladder beforehand, then concealing it. Then people take turns choosing a path to start from at the top. If no part of the amidakuji is concealed, then it is possible to fix the system so that you are guaranteed to get a certain pairing, thus defeating the idea of random chance."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

In practice, the training dataset often consist of pairs of an input vector (or scalar) and the corresponding output vector (or scalar), which is commonly denoted as the \"target\" (or \"label\"). The current model is run with the training dataset and produces a result, which is then compared with the \"target\", for each input vector in the training dataset. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation.\n\nSuccessively, the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second dataset called the validation dataset. The validation dataset provides an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tuning the model's hyperparameters (e.g. the number of hidden units in a neural network). Validation datasets can be used for regularization by early stopping: stop training when the error on the validation dataset increases, as this is a sign of overfitting to the training dataset.\n\nFinally, the test dataset is a dataset used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a \"final\" model fit on the training dataset.

In a prediction problem, a model is usually given a dataset of \"known data\" on which training is run (\"training dataset\"), and a dataset of \"unknown data\" (or \"first seen\" data) against which the model is tested (called the validation dataset or \"testing set\"). The goal of cross-validation is to test the model's ability to predict new data that was not used in estimating it, in order to flag problems like overfitting or selection bias and to give an insight on how the model will generalize to an independent dataset (i.e., an unknown dataset, for instance from a real problem).\nOne round of cross-validation involves partitioning a sample of data into complementary subsets, performing the analysis on one subset (called the \"training set\"), and validating the analysis on the other subset (called the \"validation set\" or \"testing set\").

These quantum routines can be employed for learning algorithms that translate into an unstructured search task, as can be done, for instance, in the case of the k-medians and the k-nearest neighbors algorithms. Another application is a quadratic speedup in the training of perceptron.\nSome research groups have recently explored the use of quantum annealing hardware for training Boltzmann machines and deep neural networks. The standard approach to training Boltzmann machines relies on the computation of certain averages that can be estimated by standard sampling techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Another possibility is to rely on a physical process, like quantum annealing, that naturally generates samples from a Boltzmann distribution.

The training data involved the pre-processing of the image which maps them to normalized 2-dimensional vectors to represent the images as the states of a qubit. The two entries of the vector are the vertical and horizontal ratio of the pixel intensity of the image. Once the vectors are defined on the feature space, the quantum support vector machine was implemented to classify the unknown input vector. The readout avoids costly quantum tomography by reading out the final state in terms of direction (up/down) of the NMR signal.\nUsing non-linear photonics to implement an all-optical linear classifier, a perceptron model was capable of learning the classification boundary iteratively from training data through a feedback rule. A core building block in many learning algorithms is to calculate the distance between two vectors: this was first experimentally demonstrated for up to eight dimensions using entangled qubits in a photonic quantum computer in 2015.\nRecently, based on a neuromimetic approach, a novel ingredient has been added to the field of quantum machine learning, in the form of a so-called quantum memristor, a quantized model of the standard classical memristor.

To detect a novel type of fraud may require the use of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.\nSome important studies with unsupervised learning with respect to fraud detection should be mentioned. For example, Bolton and Hand use Peer Group Analysis and Break Point Analysis applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts. Peer Group Analysis detects individual objects that begin to behave in a way different from objects to which they had previously been similar. Another tool Bolton and Hand develop for behavioural fraud detection is Break Point Analysis. Unlike Peer Group Analysis, Break Point Analysis operates on the account level. A break point is an observation where anomalous behaviour for a particular account is detected. Both the tools are applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts.\nAlso, Murad and Pinkas focus on behavioural changes for the purpose of fraud detection and present three-level-profiling. Three-level-profiling method operates at the account level and points to any significant deviation from an account's normal behaviour as a potential fraud. In order to do this, 'normal' profiles are created based on data without fraudulent records (semi supervised). In the same field, also Burge and Shawe-Taylor use behaviour profiling for the purpose of fraud detection.

Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.\nDecision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning.\nSupport vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.\nA Bayesian network, belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG).\nA genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s."], "wikipedia-44108758": ["Quantum-enhanced machine learning refers to quantum algorithms that solve tasks in machine learning, thereby improving and often expediting classical machine learning techniques. Such algorithms typically require one to encode the given classical data set into a quantum computer to make it accessible for quantum information processing. Subsequently, quantum information processing routines are applied and the result of the quantum computation is read out by measuring the quantum system. For example, the outcome of the measurement of a qubit reveals the result of a binary classification task. While many proposals of quantum machine learning algorithms are still purely theoretical and require a full-scale universal quantum computer to be tested, others have been implemented on small-scale or special purpose quantum devices.\n\nSection::::Machine learning with quantum computers.:Linear algebra simulation with quantum amplitudes.\nA number of quantum algorithms for machine learning are based on the idea of \"amplitude encoding\", that is, to associate the amplitudes of a quantum state with the inputs and outputs of computations. Since a state of formula_1qubits is described by formula_2 complex amplitudes, this information encoding can allow for an exponentially compact representation. Intuitively, this corresponds to associating a discrete probability distribution over binary random variables with a classical vector. The goal of algorithms based on amplitude encoding is to formulate quantum algorithms whose resources grow polynomially in the number of qubits formula_1, which amounts to a logarithmic growth in the number of amplitudes and thereby the dimension of the input.\nMany quantum machine learning algorithms in this category are based on variations of the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations (colloquially called HHL, after the paper's authors) which, under specific conditions, performs a matrix inversion using an amount of physical resources growing only logarithmically in the dimensions of the matrix. One of these conditions is that a Hamiltonian which entrywise corresponds to the matrix can be simulated efficiently, which is known to be possible if the matrix is sparse or low rank. For reference, any known classical algorithm for matrix inversion requires a number of operations that grows at least quadratically in the dimension of the matrix.\nQuantum matrix inversion can be applied to machine learning methods in which the training reduces to solving a linear system of equations, for example in least-squares linear regression, the least-squares version of support vector machines, and Gaussian processes.\nA crucial bottleneck of methods that simulate linear algebra computations with the amplitudes of quantum states is state preparation, which often requires one to initialise a quantum system in a state whose amplitudes reflect the features of the entire dataset. Although efficient methods for state preparation are known for specific cases, this step easily hides the complexity of the task.\n\nSection::::Machine learning with quantum computers.:Quantum machine learning algorithms based on Grover search.\nAnother approach to improving classical machine learning with quantum information processing uses amplitude amplification methods based on Grover's search algorithm, which has been shown to solve unstructured search problems with a quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms. These quantum routines can be employed for learning algorithms that translate into an unstructured search task, as can be done, for instance, in the case of the k-medians and the k-nearest neighbors algorithms. Another application is a quadratic speedup in the training of perceptron.\nAmplitude amplification is often combined with quantum walks to achieve the same quadratic speedup. Quantum walks have been proposed to enhance Google's PageRank algorithm as well as the performance of reinforcement learning agents in the projective simulation framework.\n\nSection::::Machine learning with quantum computers.:Quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning.\nReinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning distinct from supervised and unsupervised learning, which also admits quantum enhancements. In quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning, a quantum agent interacts with a classical environment and occasionally receives rewards for its actions, which allows the agent to adapt its behavior\u2014in other words, to learn what to do in order to gain more rewards. In some situations, either because of the quantum processing capability of the agent, or due to the possibility to probe the environment in superpositions, a quantum speedup may be achieved. Implementations of these kinds of protocols in superconducting circuits and in systems of trapped ions have been proposed.\n\nSection::::Machine learning with quantum computers.:Quantum annealing.\nQuantum annealing is an optimization technique used to determine the local minima and maxima of a function over a given set of candidate functions. This is a method of discretizing a function with many local minima or maxima in order to determine the observables of the function. The process can be distinguished from Simulated annealing by the Quantum tunneling process, by which particles tunnel through kinetic or potential barriers from a high state to a low state. Quantum annealing starts from a superposition of all possible states of a system, weighted equally. Then the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation guides the time evolution of the system, serving to affect the amplitude of each state as time increases. Eventually, the ground state can be reached to yield the instantaneous Hamiltonian of the system.\n\nSection::::Machine learning with quantum computers.:Quantum sampling techniques.\nSampling from high-dimensional probability distributions is at the core of a wide spectrum of computational techniques with important applications across science, engineering, and society. Examples include deep learning, probabilistic programming, and other machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.\nA computationally hard problem, which is key for some relevant machine learning tasks, is the estimation of averages over probabilistic models defined in terms of a Boltzmann distribution. Sampling from generic probabilistic models is hard: algorithms relying heavily on sampling are expected to remain intractable no matter how large and powerful classical computing resources become. Even though quantum annealers, like those produced by D-Wave Systems, were designed for challenging combinatorial optimization problems, it has been recently recognized as a potential candidate to speed up computations that rely on sampling by exploiting quantum effects.\nSome research groups have recently explored the use of quantum annealing hardware for training Boltzmann machines and deep neural networks. The standard approach to training Boltzmann machines relies on the computation of certain averages that can be estimated by standard sampling techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Another possibility is to rely on a physical process, like quantum annealing, that naturally generates samples from a Boltzmann distribution. The objective is to find the optimal control parameters that best represent the empirical distribution of a given dataset.\nThe D-Wave 2X system hosted at NASA Ames Research Center has been recently used for the learning of a special class of restricted Boltzmann machines that can serve as a building block for deep learning architectures. Complementary work that appeared roughly simultaneously showed that quantum annealing can be used for supervised learning in classification tasks. The same device was later used to train a fully connected Boltzmann machine to generate, reconstruct, and classify down-scaled, low-resolution handwritten digits, among other synthetic datasets. In both cases, the models trained by quantum annealing had a similar or better performance in terms of quality. The ultimate question that drives this endeavour is whether there is quantum speedup in sampling applications. Experience with the use of quantum annealers for combinatorial optimization suggests the answer is not straightforward.\nInspired by the success of Boltzmann machines based on classical Boltzmann distribution, a new machine learning approach based on quantum Boltzmann distribution of a transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian was recently proposed. Due to the non-commutative nature of quantum mechanics, the training process of the quantum Boltzmann machine can become nontrivial. This problem was, to some extent, circumvented by introducing bounds on the quantum probabilities, allowing the authors to train the model efficiently by sampling. It is possible that a specific type of quantum Boltzmann machine has been trained in the D-Wave 2X by using a learning rule analogous to that of classical Boltzmann machines.\nQuantum annealing is not the only technology for sampling. In a prepare-and-measure scenario, a universal quantum computer prepares a thermal state, which is then sampled by measurements. This can reduce the time required to train a deep restricted Boltzmann machine, and provide a richer and more comprehensive framework for deep learning than classical computing. The same quantum methods also permit efficient training of full Boltzmann machines", "Quantum analogues or generalizations of classical neural nets are often referred to as quantum neural networks. The term is claimed by a wide range of approaches, including the implementation and extension of neural networks using photons, layered variational circuits or quantum Ising-type models. Quantum neural networks are often defined as an expansion on Deutsch's model of a quantum computational network. Within this model, nonlinear and irreversible gates, dissimilar to the Hamiltonian operator, are deployed to speculate the given data set. Such gates make certain phases unable to be observed and generate specific oscillations. Quantum neural networks apply the principals quantum information and quantum computation to classical neurocomputing. Current research shows that QNN can exponentially increase the amount of computing power and the degrees of freedom for a computer, which is limited for a classical computer to its size. A quantum neural network has computational capabilities to decrease the number of steps, qubits used, and computation time. The wave function to quantum mechanics is the neuron for Neural networks. To test quantum applications in a neural network, quantum dot molecules are deposited on a substrate of GaAs or similar to record how they communicate with one another. Each quantum dot can be referred as an island of electric activity, and when such dots are close enough (approximately 10\u00b120\u00a0nm) electrons can tunnel underneath the islands. An even distribution across the substrate in sets of two create dipoles and ultimately two spin states, up or down. These states are commonly known as qubits with corresponding states of |0 and |1 in Dirac notation.", "The training data involved the pre-processing of the image which maps them to normalized 2-dimensional vectors to represent the images as the states of a qubit. The two entries of the vector are the vertical and horizontal ratio of the pixel intensity of the image. Once the vectors are defined on the feature space, the quantum support vector machine was implemented to classify the unknown input vector. The readout avoids costly quantum tomography by reading out the final state in terms of direction (up/down) of the NMR signal.\nUsing non-linear photonics to implement an all-optical linear classifier, a perceptron model was capable of learning the classification boundary iteratively from training data through a feedback rule. A core building block in many learning algorithms is to calculate the distance between two vectors: this was first experimentally demonstrated for up to eight dimensions using entangled qubits in a photonic quantum computer in 2015.\nRecently, based on a neuromimetic approach, a novel ingredient has been added to the field of quantum machine learning, in the form of a so-called quantum memristor, a quantized model of the standard classical memristor. This device can be constructed by means of a tunable resistor, weak measurements on the system, and a classical feed-forward mechanism. An implementation of a quantum memristor in superconducting circuits has been proposed, and an experiment with quantum dots performed. A quantum memristor would implement nonlinear interactions in the quantum dynamics which would aid the search for a fully functional quantum neural network."], "wikipedia-61373032": ["For example, Bayesian methods and concepts of algorithmic learning can be fruitfully applied to tackle quantum state classification, Hamiltonian learning, and the characterization of an unknown unitary transformation.

Deep learning uses multiple layers of ANN and other techniques to progressively extract information from an input.

These types of networks are able to learn translation invariant patterns, which are patterns that are not dependent on location. CNNs are able to learn these patterns in a hierarchy, meaning that earlier convolutional layers will learn smaller local patterns while later layers will learn larger patterns based on the previous patterns. A CNN's ability to learn visual data has made it a commonly used tool for deep learning in games.\nSection::::Overview of relevant machine learning techniques.:Recurrent neural network.\nRecurrent neural networks are a type of ANN that are designed to process sequences of data in order, one part at a time rather than all at once. An RNN runs over each part of a sequence, using the current part of the sequence along with memory of previous parts of the current sequence to produce an output. These types of ANN are highly effective at tasks such as speech recognition and other problems that depend heavily on temporal order. There are several types of RNNs with different internal configurations; the basic implementation suffers from a lack of long term memory due to the vanishing gradient problem, thus it is rarely used over newer implementations.\nSection::::Overview of relevant machine learning techniques.:Recurrent neural network.:Long short-term memory.\nA long short-term memory (LSTM) network is a specific implementation of a RNN that is designed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem seen in simple RNNs, which would lead to them gradually \"forgetting\" about previous parts of an inputted sequence when calculating the output of a current part. LSTMs solve this problem with the addition of an elaborate system that uses an additional input/output to keep track of long term data. LSTMs have achieved very strong results across various fields, and were used by several monumental deep learning agents in games.\nSection::::Overview of relevant machine learning techniques.:Reinforcement learning.\nReinforcement learning is the process of training an agent using rewards and/or punishments. The way an agent is rewarded or punished depends heavily on the problem; such as giving an agent a positive reward for winning a game or a negative one for losing. Reinforcement learning is used heavily in the field of machine learning and can be seen in methods such as Q-learning, policy search, Deep Q-networks and others. It has seen strong performance in both the field of games and robotics.\nSection::::Overview of relevant machine learning techniques.:Neuroevolution.\nNeuroevolution involves the use of both neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.

Specifically, a rule-learning program to uncover indicators of fraudulent behaviour from a large database of customer transactions is implemented.\nCahill et al. (2000) design a fraud signature, based on data of fraudulent calls, to detect telecommunications fraud. For scoring a call for fraud its probability under the account signature is compared to its probability under a fraud signature. The fraud signature is updated sequentially, enabling event-driven fraud detection.\nLink analysis comprehends a different approach. It relates known fraudsters to other individuals, using record linkage and social network methods.\nThis type of detection is only able to detect frauds similar to those which have occurred previously and been classified by a human. To detect a novel type of fraud may require the use of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.\nSection::::Machine learning and data mining.:Unsupervised learning.\nIn contrast, unsupervised methods don't make use of labelled records.\nSome important studies with unsupervised learning with respect to fraud detection should be mentioned. For example, Bolton and Hand use Peer Group Analysis and Break Point Analysis applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts. Peer Group Analysis detects individual objects that begin to behave in a way different from objects to which they had previously been similar. Another tool Bolton and Hand develop for behavioural fraud detection is Break Point Analysis. Unlike Peer Group Analysis, Break Point Analysis operates on the account level. A break point is an observation where anomalous behaviour for a particular account is detected. Both the tools are applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts.\nAlso, Murad and Pinkas focus on behavioural changes for the purpose of fraud detection and present three-level-profiling. Three-level-profiling method operates at the account level and points to any significant deviation from an account's normal behaviour as a potential fraud. In order to do this, 'normal' profiles are created based on data without fraudulent records (semi supervised). In the same field, also Burge and Shawe-Taylor use behaviour profiling for the purpose of fraud detection.

For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify human-meaningful items such as digits or letters or faces.\nSection::::Overview.\nMost modern deep learning models are based on artificial neural networks, specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)s, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines.\nIn deep learning, each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation. In an image recognition application, the raw input may be a matrix of pixels; the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges; the third layer may encode a nose and eyes; and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level \"on its own\". (Of course, this does not completely obviate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.)\nThe \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial \"credit assignment path\" (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. No universally agreed upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth  2. CAP of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. Beyond that more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP  2) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning features.\nDeep learning architectures are often constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance.\nFor supervised learning tasks, deep learning methods obviate feature engineering, by translating the data into compact intermediate representations akin to principal components, and derive layered structures that remove redundancy in representation.", "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.

The DNN finds the correct mathematical manipulation to turn the input into the output, whether it be a linear relationship or a non-linear relationship. The network moves through the layers calculating the probability of each output. For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name \"deep\" networks.\nDNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives. The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network.", "DNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back. At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or \"weights\", to connections between them. The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. If the network didn\u2019t accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights. That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data.\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs), in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling. Long short-term memory is particularly effective for this use.\nConvolutional deep neural networks (CNNs) are used in computer vision. CNNs also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR)."], "wikipedia-38870173": ["Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process.

The most popular network architecture of this type is Siamese networks.", "The hierarchical architecture of the biological neural system inspires deep learning architectures for feature learning by stacking multiple layers of learning nodes. These architectures are often designed based on the assumption of distributed representation: observed data is generated by the interactions of many different factors on multiple levels. In a deep learning architecture, the output of each intermediate layer can be viewed as a representation of the original input data. Each level uses the representation produced by previous level as input, and produces new representations as output, which is then fed to higher levels. The input at the bottom layer is raw data, and the output of the final layer is the final low-dimensional feature or representation."], "wikipedia-46207323": ["Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning, and is both difficult and expensive. The need for manual feature engineering can be obviated by automated feature learning.\nFeature engineering is an informal topic, but it is considered essential in applied machine learning.\nSection::::Features.\nA feature is an attribute or property shared by all of the independent units on which analysis or prediction is to be done. Any attribute could be a feature, as long as it is useful to the model.\nThe purpose of a feature, other than being an attribute, would be much easier to understand in the context of a problem. A feature is a characteristic that might help when solving the problem.\nSection::::Importance of features.\nThe features in your data are important to the predictive models you use and will influence the results you are going to achieve. The quality and quantity of the features will have great influence on whether the model is good or not.\nYou could say the better the features are, the better the result is. This isn't entirely true, because the results achieved also depend on the model and the data, not just the chosen features. That said, choosing the right features is still very important. Better features can produce simpler and more flexible models, and they often yield better results.\nSection::::The process of feature engineering.\nThe process of feature engineering is:\nBULLET::::1. Brainstorming or Testing features;\nBULLET::::2. Deciding what features to create;\nBULLET::::3. Creating features;\nBULLET::::4. Checking how the features work with your model;\nBULLET::::5. Improving your features if needed;\nBULLET::::6. Go back to brainstorming/creating more features until the work is done.\nSection::::Feature relevance.\nDepending on a feature it could be strongly relevant (i.e., the feature has information that doesn't exist in any other feature), relevant, weakly relevant (some information that other features include) or irrelevant. It is important to create a lot of features. Even if some of them are irrelevant, you can't afford missing the rest. Afterwards, feature selection can be used in order to prevent overfitting.\nSection::::Feature explosion.\nFeature explosion can be caused by feature combination or feature templates, both leading to a quick growth in the total number of features.\nBULLET::::- Feature templates - implementing features templates instead of coding new features\nBULLET::::- Feature combinations - combinations that cannot be represented by the linear system\nThere are a few solutions to help stop feature explosion such as: regularization, kernel method, feature selection.\nSection::::Automated Feature Engineering.\nAutomation of feature engineering has become an emerging topic of research in academia. In 2015, researchers at MIT presented the Deep Feature Synthesis algorithm and demonstrated its effectiveness in online data science competitions where it beat 615 of 906 human teams. Deep Feature Synthesis is available as an open source library called Featuretools. That work was followed by other researchers including IBM's OneBM and Berkeley's ExploreKit. The researchers at IBM state that feature engineering automation \"helps data scientists reduce data exploration time allowing them to try and error many ideas in short time. On the other hand, it enables non-experts, who are not familiar with data science, to quickly extract value from their data with a little effort, time, and cost.\"\nCommercial tools have emerged from new machine learning focused startups including H20.ai, Feature Labs and Xpanse AI."], "wikipedia-42129549": ["OpenNN (Open Neural Networks Library) is a software library written in the C++ programming language which implements neural networks, a main area of deep learning research.

This deep architecture allows the design of neural networks with universal approximation properties. Additionally, it allows multiprocessing programming by means of OpenMP, in order to increase computer performance.\n\nOpenNN contains data mining algorithms as a bundle of functions. These can be embedded in other software tools, using an application programming interface, for the integration of the predictive analytics tasks.

Multilayer perceptrons usually refer to fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The \"fully-connectedness\" of these networks makes them prone to overfitting data. Typical ways of regularization include adding some form of magnitude measurement of weights to the loss function. However, CNNs take a different approach towards regularization: they take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble more complex patterns using smaller and simpler patterns. Therefore, on the scale of connectedness and complexity, CNNs are on the lower extreme.\nThey are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.\nConvolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. Individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the receptive field. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field.\nCNNs use relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms. This means that the network learns the filters that in traditional algorithms were hand-engineered. This independence from prior knowledge and human effort in feature design is a major advantage.\nThey have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, medical image analysis, and natural language processing."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. **Yes**  \n2. arXiv contains numerous papers that provide definitions and explanations of \"neural networks,\" \"feature engineering,\" and \"deep learning libraries\" in introductory or review articles.

In compiler theory, the technique used to discover data dependencies among statements (or instructions) is called dependence analysis.\nThere are three types of dependencies: data, name, and control.\nSection::::Data dependencies.\nAssuming statement formula_1 and formula_2, formula_2 depends on formula_1 if:\nformula_5\nwhere:\nBULLET::::- formula_6 is the set of memory locations read by formula_7 and\nBULLET::::- formula_8 is the set of memory locations written by formula_9\nBULLET::::- and there is a feasible run-time execution path from formula_1 to formula_2\nThis Condition is called Bernstein Condition, named by A. J. Bernstein.\nThree cases exist:\nBULLET::::- Anti-dependence: formula_12, formula_13 and formula_1 reads something before formula_2 overwrites it\nBULLET::::- Flow (data) dependence: formula_16, formula_17 and formula_1 writes before something read by formula_2\nBULLET::::- Output dependence: formula_20, formula_13 and both write the same memory location.\nSection::::Data dependencies.:Flow dependency.\nA Flow dependency, also known as a data dependency or true dependency or read-after-write (RAW), occurs when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction:\nInstruction 3 is truly dependent on instruction 2, as the final value of C depends on the instruction updating B. Instruction 2 is truly dependent on instruction 1, as the final value of B depends on the instruction updating A. Since instruction 3 is truly dependent upon instruction 2 and instruction 2 is truly dependent on instruction 1, instruction 3 is also truly dependent on instruction 1. Instruction level parallelism is therefore not an option in this example.\nSection::::Data dependencies.:Anti-dependency.\nAn anti-dependency, also known as write-after-read (WAR), occurs when an instruction requires a value that is later updated. In the following example, instruction 2 anti-depends on instruction 3 \u2014 the ordering of these instructions cannot be changed, nor can they be executed in parallel (possibly changing the instruction ordering), as this would affect the final value of A.\nAn anti-dependency is an example of a \"name dependency\". That is, renaming of variables could remove the dependency, as in the next example:\nA new variable, B2, has been declared as a copy of B in a new instruction, instruction N. The anti-dependency between 2 and 3 has been removed, meaning that these instructions may now be executed in parallel. However, the modification has introduced a new dependency: instruction 2 is now truly dependent on instruction N, which is truly dependent upon instruction 1. As flow dependencies, these new dependencies are impossible to safely remove.\nSection::::Data dependencies.:Output dependency.\nAn output dependency, also known as write-after-write (WAW), occurs when the ordering of instructions will affect the final output value of a variable. In the example below, there is an output dependency between instructions 3 and 1 \u2014 changing the ordering of instructions in this example will change the final value of A, thus these instructions cannot be executed in parallel.\nAs with anti-dependencies, output dependencies are \"name dependencies\". That is, they may be removed through renaming of variables, as in the below modification of the above example:\nA commonly used naming convention for data dependencies is the following: Read-after-Write or RAW (flow dependency), Write-After-Read or WAR (anti-dependency), or Write-after-Write or WAW (output dependency)."], "wikipedia-33171840": ["In the case of network activity, the analysis is based on partial correlations, which are becoming ever more widely used to investigate complex systems. In simple words, the partial (or residual) correlation is a measure of the effect (or contribution) of a given node, say \"j\", on the correlations between another pair of nodes, say \"i\" and \"k\". Using this concept, the dependency of one node on another node, is calculated for the entire network. This results in a directed weighted adjacency matrix, of a fully connected network. Once the adjacency matrix has been constructed, different algorithms can be used to construct the network, such as a threshold network, Minimal Spanning Tree (MST), Planar Maximally Filtered Graph (PMFG), and others.\n\nTo be more specific, the partial correlations of the pair, given \"j\" is the correlations between them after proper subtraction of the correlations between \"i\" and \"j\" and between \"k\" and \"j\". Defined this way, the difference between the correlations and the partial correlations provides a measure of the influence of node \"j\" on the correlation. Therefore, we define the influence of node \"j\" on node \"i\", or the dependency of node \"i\" on node \"j- D(i,j)\", to be the sum of the influence of node \"j\" on the correlations of node \"i\" with all other nodes.\n\nNext, we define the total influence of node \"j\" on node \"i\", or the dependency \"D(i,j)\" of node \"i\" on node \"j\" to be: \nformula_15\nAs defined,\"D(i,j)\" is a measure of the average influence of node \"j\" on the correlations \"C(i,k)\" over all nodes \"k\" not equal to \"j\". The node activity dependencies define a dependency matrix \"D\" whose \"(i,j)\" element is the dependency of node \"i\" on node \"j\". It is important to note that while the correlation matrix C is a symmetric matrix, the dependency matrix D is nonsymmetrical \u2013 formula_16 since the influence of node \"j\" on node \"i\" is not equal to the influence of node \"i\" on node \"j\". For this reason, some of the methods used in the analyses of the correlation matrix (e.g. the PCA) have to be replaced or are less efficient. Yet there are other methods, as the ones used here, that can properly account for the non-symmetric nature of the dependency matrix."], "wikipedia-35269346": ["BULLET::::- Random sequences.

More intricate ways of ending a message such as ciphertext stealing or residual block termination avoid the need for padding.\n\nA disadvantage of padding is that it makes the plain text of the message susceptible to padding oracle attacks. Padding oracle attacks allow the attacker to gain knowledge of the plain text without attacking the block cipher primitive itself. Padding oracle attacks can be avoided by making sure that an attacker cannot gain knowledge about the removal of the padding bytes. This can be accomplished by verifying a message authentication code (MAC) or digital signature \"before\" removal of the padding bytes, or by switching to a streaming mode of operation."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2. The concept of 'padding sequences' is a common preprocessing technique in machine learning, particularly for models handling variable-length inputs (e.g., in NLP or time-series analysis). arXiv papers on topics like sequence modeling, transformers, or RNNs often explain padding as the process of adding dummy tokens (usually zeros) to shorter sequences to ensure uniform length across a batch. This is necessary because many models require fixed-length inputs for efficient parallel processing. Padding allows batches of sequences to be processed simultaneously while preserving the original data's structure.", "arxiv-2403.06372": ["When training sequential models, padding is a widely adopted technique for two main reasons: 1) The vast majority of models can only handle fixed-length sequences; 2) Batching-based training needs to ensure that the sequences in each batch have the same length.

This information could help address the query.", "wikipedia-922505": ["A receiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity, recall or \"probability of detection\" in machine learning. The false-positive rate is also known as the fall-out or \"probability of false alarm\" and can be calculated as (1 \u2212 specificity). It can also be thought of as a plot of the power as a function of the Type I Error of the decision rule (when the performance is calculated from just a sample of the population, it can be thought of as estimators of these quantities). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity as a function of fall-out.\n\nSometimes, the ROC is used to generate a summary statistic.

Gender HCI investigates whether these differences need to be taken into account in the design of software and hardware.\n\n1. \"Reward Expectations of Gendered Computers.\"\n- In one experiment, subjects worked on a task with a computerized partner that was named James or Julie. The task was gender-neutral, meaning that it was not directly relevant to being a man or woman. The results showed that subjects behaved the same way toward a computer named James or Julie. Despite these similarities in behavior, subjects estimated that a computer named James would cost them significantly more than one named Julie. The findings show gender shape user perceptions of their computers, which lack the human features that define the characteristic of gender.\n\n2. \"Confidence-related findings.\"\n- For spreadsheet problem-solving tasks, (1) female end users had significantly lower self-efficacy than males and (2) women with low self-efficacy were significantly less likely to work effectively with problem-solving features available in the software. In contrast, males\u2019 self-efficacy did not impact their effectiveness with these features.\n- In a study of the computer attitudes and self-efficacy of 147 college students, gender differences existed in self-efficacy for complex tasks (such as word processing and spreadsheet software), but not simpler tasks. Also, male students had more experience working with computers and reported more encouragement from parents and friends.\n\n3. \"Software feature related findings.\"\n- In spreadsheet problem-solving tasks, female end users were significantly slower to try out unfamiliar features. Females significantly more often agreed with the statement, \"I was afraid I would take too long to learn the [untaught feature].\" Even if they tried it once, females were significantly less likely to adopt new features for repeated use. For females, unlike for males, self-efficacy predicted the amount of effective feature usage. There was no significant difference in the success of the two genders or in learning how the features worked, implying that females\u2019 low self-efficacy about their usage of new features was not an accurate assessment of their problem-solving potential, but rather became a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n4. \"Behavior related findings.\"\n- In spreadsheet problem-solving tasks, tinkering (playfully experimenting) with features was adopted by males more often than females. While males were comfortable with this behavior, some did it to excess. For females, the amount of tinkering predicted success. Pauses after any action were predictive of better understanding for both genders.\n- Males viewed machines as a challenge, something to be mastered, overcome, and be measured against. They were risk-takers, and they demonstrated this by eagerly trying new techniques and approaches. Females rejected the image of the male hacker as alienating and depersonalizing. Their approach to computers was \"soft;\" tactile, artistic, and communicative.\n\n5. \"Hardware interface findings.\"\n- Larger displays helped reduce the gender gap in navigating virtual environments. With smaller displays, males\u2019 performance was better than females\u2019. With larger displays, females\u2019 performance improved and males\u2019 performance was not negatively affected.\n\n6. \"Video games findings.\"\n- Several findings were reported about girls\u2019 interests that relate to video games, with interpretations for the video game software industry.\n- Several researchers explored what girls seek in video games, and implications for video game designers. Among the implications were collaboration vs. competition preferences, and use of non-violent rewards versus death and destruction as rewards. These works argue both sides of the question as to whether or not to design games specifically for girls.\n\n7. \"Other related findings about gender and computers.\"\n- In a study of the way people interacted with conversational software agents in relation to the sex of the agent, the female virtual agent received many more violent and sexual overtures than either the male one or the gender-free one (a robot).\n- In the home, where many appliances are programmable to some extent, different categories of appliance were found to be more likely to be programmed by men (e.g. entertainment devices) and by women (e.g. kitchen appliances). There is often one member of a household who assumes responsibility for programming a particular device, with a \"domestic economy\" accounting for this task.\n- Males and females had different perceptions for whether a web page would be appropriate for his/her home country, and further, females more often than males preferred more information on all web pages viewed during a study.\n- Women who entered mathematics, science, and technology careers had high academic and social self-efficacy. Their self-efficacy was based on vicarious experiences and verbal persuasion of significant people around them.\n- Factors affecting low retention of women in computer science majors in college included women\u2019s lower previous experience in computing compared to men, their low self-perceived ability, discouragement by the dominant male peer culture, and lack of encouragement from faculty."], "wikipedia-24131652": ["Activities heavily associated with violence are overwhelmingly shaped by understandings of gender and gender roles. War, for example, in contemporary understandings is divided between civilian and combatants with a general understanding that men make up the vast majority of combatants and women and young children the majority of civilians. In cases like the Srebenica massacre, in which 8,000 men and male children were killed, the basis of their murder was a gendered understanding that they had the potential of being, or becoming combatants in the Bosnian war.\n\nViolence against women is a major concern in the Asian regions, especially the prevalence of marital violence varies considerably across South Asian countries. For married women aged 15\u201349 years, physical or sexual violence within marriage has been experienced by 20% in the Maldives, 26% in Pakistan, 28% in Nepal, 38% in India and 53% in Bangladesh.\n\nGendered violence in the Middle East greatly targets women and is justified by political and religious laws. Acts of gendered violence take the form of forced early marriage, rape, and domestic violence. Gendered violence can also be found in instances where Shariah, Islamic law, is used to justify killing women in order to preserve male honor.\n\nGendered violence continues to be an ongoing issue in the European region with high rates of sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, domestic violence and conflict. Within the European Union research suggests that one-third of all women over fifteen years old have experienced some form of physical or sexual violence.\n\nGendered violence exists in North America in forms such as stalking, intimate partner violence, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and sexual assault. Overall, women in North America are victims of sexual violence far more than men. Studies indicate that 82% of sexual assault survivors are women, while 98% of offenders are men.\n\nA major cause of gendered violence in Central and South America comes from a high prevalence of gang affiliations and memberships. Women who try to leave gangs will often be threatened by other members and will stay in affiliation because they receive very little help from authorities.\n\nThe prevalence of violence against women is very severe in Africa where around one third of African women report experiencing domestic violence both physical and sexual. Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is considered a form of gender based violation that has a great influence on women and girls\u2019 bodies. More than 200 million girls and women alive today have been subjected to FGM in 30 countries in Africa and the Middle East."], "wikipedia-9116382": ["Japanese has no grammatical gender or number.

Japanese custom has also dictated that women are expected to use a polite form of language (\"keigo\") in more situations than men. This expectation has diminished more among urban young female Japanese in the past decade.\nThe major issues with regard to gendered language in Japanese refer to overall speech patterns. There exists a \"woman's language\" (\"onna kotoba\") . Women's speech has different sentence endings from that of men, especially in non-polite speech. (Polite speech tends to be less differentiated, with male speech becoming more similar to female.) A good example is the gender-neutral use of \"watashi\" or \"watakushi\" for \"I\" in polite speech. In informal speech, women are still more likely to use \"watashi\" or \"atashi\", while men use \"boku\", \"ore\" or \"washi\". Women's speech is characterized by sentences ending with \"wa\" (rising intonation) and by dropping the verbs \"da\" or \"desu\" (meaning \"is\"). Male speech never drops the word \"da\" in a sentence. The differences are quite intricate, but very persistent, and there is little or no movement in Japan to change male/female speech patterns, since changes can sound awkward or confusing. However, some historians note that over time Japanese usage as a whole is shifting toward the feminine forms. Before recent times, men never used words like \"kane\" (\"money\") with the honorific prefix \"o-\". Today \"okane\" is standard Japanese and is used by men in non-polite situations, something unthinkable a hundred years ago."], "wikipedia-1305554": ["Psychological sex differences refer to emotional, motivational or cognitive differences between the sexes. Examples include a greater male tendencies toward violence, or that the female brain appears to have a strong affinity for empathy.\n\nMany different studies have been conducted on sex differences in the play behavior of young children, often yielding conflicting results. One study conducted on nineteen-month-old children revealed a male preference for stereotypically \"masculine\" toys, and a female preference for stereotypically \"feminine\" toys, with males showing more variance in play behavior. A study of thirteen-month-old children supported the theory that males and females typically prefer toys typed to their gender, but instead found females showing more variance instead of males. An additional study found that a gendered divide in regards to toys may express itself as early as nine-months of age. Despite these apparent differences, a study of toddlers showed that both boys and girls were equally active when playing, and both sexes preferred toys that allowed them to express this.\n\nThe specific cause of this sex difference has also been investigated. A study with 112 boys and 100 girls found that the difference in play behavior appeared to be semi-correlated with fetal testosterone. Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and thus exposed to high androgen levels during pregnancy tend to play more with male-typical toys and less with female-typical ones. However, some have argued that the characteristics of the condition itself could also result in those girls preferring different types of toys.\n\nOne study also claimed that one-day-old girls gaze longer at a face, whereas suspended mechanical mobiles, rather than a face, keep boys' attention for longer, though this study has been criticized as having methodological flaws. \n\nPsychological theories exist regarding the development and expression of gender differences in human sexuality. A number of these theories are consistent in predicting that men should be more approving of casual sex (sex happening outside a stable, committed relationship such as marriage) and should also be more promiscuous (have a higher number of sexual partners) than women:\n\nA sociobiological approach applies evolutionary biology to human sexuality, emphasizing reproductive success in shaping patterns of sexual behavior. According to sociobiologists, since women's parental investment in reproduction is greater than men's, owing to human sperm being much more plentiful than eggs, and the fact that women must devote considerable energy to gestating their offspring, women will tend to be much more selective in their choice of mates than men. It may not be possible to accurately test sociobiological theories in relation to promiscuity and casual sex in contemporary (U.S.) society, which is quite different from the ancestral human societies in which most natural selection for sexual traits has occurred.\n\nNeoanalytic theories are based on the observation that mothers, as opposed to fathers, bear the major responsibility for childcare in most families and cultures; both male and female infants therefore form an intense emotional attachment to their mother, a woman. According to feminist psychoanalytic theorist Nancy Chodorow, girls tend to preserve this attachment throughout life and define their identities in relational terms, whereas boys must reject this maternal attachment in order to develop a masculine identity. In addition, this theory predicts that women's economic dependence on men in a male-dominated society will tend to cause women to approve of sex more in committed relationships providing economic security, and less so in casual relationships.\n\nThe Sexual Strategies Theory by David Buss and David P. Schmitt is an evolutionary psychology theory regarding female and male short-term and long-term mating strategies which they argued are dependent on several different goals and vary depending on the environment. Terri D. Conley et al. has argued that other empirical evidence support smaller or non-existing gender differences and social theories such as stigma, socialization, and double standards.\n\nAccording to social learning theory, sexuality is influenced by people's social environment. This theory suggests that sexual attitudes and behaviors are learned through observation of role models such as parents and media figures, as well as through positive or negative reinforcements for behaviors that match or defy established gender roles. It predicts that gender differences in sexuality can change over time as a function of changing social norms, and also that a societal double standard in punishing women more severely than men (who may in fact be rewarded) for engaging in promiscuous or casual sex will lead to significant gender differences in attitudes and behaviors regarding sexuality.\n\nSuch a societal double standard also figures in social role theory, which suggests that sexual attitudes and behaviors are shaped by the roles that men and women are expected to fill in society, and script theory, which focuses on the symbolic meaning of behaviors; this theory suggests that social conventions influence the meaning of specific acts, such as male sexuality being tied more to individual pleasure and macho stereotypes (therefore predicting a high number of casual sexual encounters) and female sexuality being tied more to the quality of a committed relationship.", "One female advantage is in verbal fluency where they have been found to perform better in vocabulary, reading comprehension, speech production and essay writing. Males have been specifically found to perform better on spatial visualization, spatial perception, and mental rotation. Researchers had then recommended that general models such as fluid and crystallized intelligence be divided into verbal, perceptual and visuospatial domains of g, because when this model is applied then females excel at verbal and perceptual tasks while males on visuospatial tasks. There are however also differences in the capacity of males and females in performing certain tasks, such as rotation of objects in space, often categorized as \"spatial ability\". Although females have lesser performance in spatial abilities, they have better performance in processing speed involving letters, digits and rapid naming tasks, object location memory, verbal memory, and also verbal learning. Most studies have found no sex differences in short term memory, the rate of memory decline due to aging, or memory of visual stimuli. Females have been found to have an advantage in recalling auditory and olfactory stimuli, experiences, faces, names, and the location of objects in space. However, males show an advantage in recalling \"masculine\" events. A study examining sex differences in performance on the California Verbal Learning Test found that males performed better on Digit Span Backwards and on reaction time, while females were better on short-term memory recall and Symbol-Digit Modalities Test. Females have also demonstrated to have better verbal memory. Cross-cultural research has shown gender differences on the tests measuring sociability and emotionality. For example, on the scales measured by the Big Five personality traits women consistently report higher Neuroticism, agreeableness, warmth (an extraversion facet) and openness to feelings, and men often report higher assertiveness (a facet of extraversion) and openness to ideas as assessed by the NEO-PI-R. Gender differences in personality traits are largest in prosperous, healthy, and egalitarian cultures in which women have more opportunities that are equal to those of men. Males on average tend to show higher levels of assertiveness and self-esteem compared to females.", "males in extraversion, anxiety, trust, and, especially, tender-mindedness (e.g., nurturance). Women have also been found to be more punishment sensitive and men higher in sensation seeking and behavioural risk-taking. Deficits in effortful control also showed a very modest effect size in the male direction.\nA meta-analysis of scientific studies concluded that men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people. When interests were classified by RIASEC type Holland Codes (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional), men showed stronger Realistic and Investigative interests, and women showed stronger Artistic, Social, and Conventional interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering, science, and mathematics interests.\nCurrent literature find that women demonstrate more empathy across studies. Women perform better than men in tests involving emotional interpretation, such as understanding facial expressions, and empathy.\nA review published in the journal \"Neuropsychologia\" found that women are better at recognizing facial effects, expression processing and emotions in general. Men were only better at recognizing specific behaviour which includes anger, aggression and threatening cues. A 2006 meta-analysis by researcher Rena A Kirkland from the \"North American Journal of Psychology\" found significant sex differences favouring females in \"Reading of the mind\" test. \"Reading of the mind\" test is an ability measure of theory of mind or cognitive empathy in which Kirkland's analysis involved 259 studies across 10 countries. Another 2014 meta-analysis in the journal of \"Cognition and Emotion\", found overall female advantage in non-verbal emotional recognition across 215 samples.\nWhen measured with an affect intensity measure, women reported greater intensity of both positive and negative affect than men. Women also reported a more intense and more frequent experience of affect, joy, and love but also experienced more embarrassment, guilt, shame, sadness, anger, fear, and distress. Experiencing pride was more frequent and intense for men than for women. In imagined frightening situations, such as being home alone and witnessing a stranger walking towards your house, women reported greater fear. Women also reported more fear in situations that involved \"a male's hostile and aggressive behavior\" (281) In anger-eliciting situations, women communicated more intense feelings of anger than men. Women also reported more intense feelings of anger in relation to terrifying situations, especially situations involving a male protagonist.\nWomen cry more than men in wealthier, more democratic, and feminine countries.\nMeta-analysis on sex differences of moral orientation have found that women tend towards a more \"care\" based morality while men tend towards a more \"justice\" based morality. This is usually based on the fact that men have a more slight utilitarian reasoning while women have more deontological reasoning which is largely because of greater female affective response and rejection of harm-based behaviours. A meta-analysis published in the 2013 journal of \"Ethics and Behaviour\" after reviewing 19 primary studies also found women have greater moral sensitivity than men.\nChildhood conduct disorder and adult antisocial personality disorder as well as substance use disorders are more common in men. Many mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders are more common in women. One explanation is that men tend to externalize stress while women tend to internalize it.", "Women have higher rates of anxiety and depression (internalizing disorders) and men have higher rates of substance abuse and antisocial disorders (externalizing disorders). It is believed that divisions of power and the responsibilities set upon each sex are critical to this predisposition. Namely, women earn less money than men do, they tend to have jobs with less power and autonomy, and women are more responsive to problems of people in their social networks. These three differences can contribute to women's predisposition to anxiety and depression. It is suggested that socializing practices that encourage high self-regard and mastery would benefit the mental health of both women and men.\n\nWomen had significantly higher prevalence rates of agoraphobia and simple phobia; however, there were no differences found between men and women in social phobia. The most common phobias for both women and men involved spiders, bugs, mice, snakes, and heights. The biggest differences between men and women in these disorders were found on the agoraphobic symptoms of \"going out of the house alone\" and \"being alone\", and on two simple phobic symptoms, involving the fear of \"any harmless or dangerous animal\" and \"storms\", with relatively more women having both phobias.\n\nIt was found that lifetime prevalence of traumatic events was a little higher in men than in women. However, following exposure to a traumatic event, the risk for PTSD was two times higher in women. It is believed this difference is due to the greater risk women have of developing PTSD after a traumatic event that involved assaultive violence. In fact, the probability of a woman developing PTSD following assaultive violence was 36% compared to 6% of men.\n\nWomen and men are both equally likely at developing symptoms of schizophrenia, but the onset occurs earlier for men. It has been suggested that sexually dimorphic brain anatomy, the differential effects of estrogens and androgens, and the heavy exposure of male adolescents to alcohol and other toxic substances can lead to this earlier onset in men. It is believed that estrogens have a protective effect against the symptoms of schizophrenia. Although, it has been shown that other factors can contribute to the delayed onset and symptoms in women, estrogens have a large effect, as can be seen during a pregnancy. In pregnancy, estrogen levels are rising in women, so women who have had recurrent acute episodes of schizophrenia did not usually break down. However, after pregnancy, when estrogen levels have dropped, women tend to suffer from postpartum psychoses. Also, psychotic symptoms are exacerbated when, during the menstrual cycle, estrogen levels are at their lowest. In addition, estrogen treatment has yielded beneficial effects in patients with schizophrenia.\n\nPathological gambling has been known to have a higher prevalence rate, 2:1, in men to women. Male gamblers were more likely to report problems with strategic forms of gambling (blackjack or poker), and female gamblers were more likely to report problems with nonstrategic forms, such as slots or bingo. Male gamblers were also more likely to report a longer duration of gambling than women. Female gamblers were more likely to report receiving mental health treatment that was not related to gambling. Male gamblers were more likely to report a drug problem or being arrested on account of gambling.\n\nThere are also differences regarding gender and suicide. Males in Western societies are much more likely to die from suicide despite females having more suicide attempts.\n\nFemales tend to have a greater basal capacity to exert inhibitory control over undesired or habitual behaviors than males and respond differently to modulatory environmental contextual factors. For example, listening to music tends to significantly improve the rate of response inhibition in females, but reduce the rate of response inhibition in males. A 2010 meta-analyses found that women have small, but persistent, advantages in punishment sensitivity and effortful control across cultures. A 2014 review found that In humans, women discount more steeply than men, but sex differences on measures of impulsive action depend on tasks and subject samples.", "In the cerebral cortex, it has been observed that there is greater \"intra\"-lobe neural communication in male brains and greater \"inter\"-lobe (between the left and right hemispheres of the cerebral cortex) neural communication in female brains. In the cerebellum, the region of the brain that plays an important role in motor functions, males showed higher connectivity between hemispheres, and females showed higher connectivity within hemispheres. This potentially provides a neural basis for previous studies that showed sex-specific difference in certain psychological functions. Females on average outperform males on emotional recognition and nonverbal reasoning tests, while males outperform females on motor and spatial cognitive tests. Fundamental sex differences in genetics, hormones and brain structure and function may manifest as distal cultural phenomena (e.g., males as primary combatants in warfare, the primarily female readership of romance novels, etc.)."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Gender-based pricing exists in many industries, including insurance, dry cleaning, hairdressing, nightclubs, clothing, and personal care products. The legality of gender-based price discrimination in matching markets has been of debate in the United States and European Union since the 1990s. The debate is centered around whether gender-based pricing is a form of gender discrimination. In other words, instead of prices being based on a market-based analysis of the effects on competition, gender-based pricing may instead reinforce negative stereotypes about both women and men in matching markets.\nGender-based price disparities have been found in personal care products, retail sales, and consumer service prices. They also exist in the pricing of insurance, such as health insurance and car insurance. Other studies suggest that gender-based price disparities often occur when negotiating and purchasing new cars.\nDiscount prices based on gender may also be a type of gender-based price discrimination. A common gender-based price discount is a \"ladies' night\" promotion, in which female patrons pay less for alcoholic drinks or a lower cover charge than male patrons do.\nConsumption taxes on certain products but not others have also been viewed a form of gender-based price disparity. For example, in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, tampons are often subjected to a consumption tax, while related products such as condoms, lubricant, and several other medical items are exempt from the tax.\nSection::::Gendered price disparities.:Personal care industry.:Personal care services.\nWhile studies have shown significant price disparities in personal care products between men and women, gendered price disparities across personal care services has been inconsistent. A recent study titled \"Cost of Doing Femininity\" examined two areas of personal care services that had directly comparable prices between men and women: hair salons and dry cleaners. The study found that only 15 out of 100 randomly selected hair salons had the same prices for both men and women, and none of the salons charged women less than men. Dry cleaning prices depended on the type and amount of fabric, with more embellishments corresponding with higher prices. This price factor, however, tended to negatively impact women more often than men because women's garments are more likely to be embroidered or be made of delicate fabric.\nSection::::Gendered price disparities.:Personal care industry.:Personal care products.\nGendered price disparities in personal care products are more apparent than in personal care services and across other industries. By and large, the price disparities in personal care products are notably higher than in other industries and cost women around 13 percent more than men. This disparity is especially significant considering women purchase these products more regularly than men. Prices for hair products, followed by razors, cost the most for women - typically costing women almost 50 percent more than men.\nSection::::Gendered price disparities.:Hair care industry.\nPrice disparities in hair salon services between men and women are thought to be justifiable because women's hair is often longer and more complicated to maintain and cut. In recent years, however, this stereotype has changed. Men are often experimenting with their hair, including hair loss treatment and hair color. While women may still spend a considerable amount for hair color and other treatments, many women prefer basic haircuts. Additionally, salon-quality hair styling tools are readily available and easy to use at home.\nGendered price disparities for hair salon services have also been documented in different locations across the United States and Europe. The California Assembly Office of Research conducted a survey of five large California cities and found that forty percent of the hair salons charged women, on average, five dollars more than men for a standard haircut. Gendered price disparities in haircut prices also has been found in New York City: Of 199 hair salons examined, nearly 48 percent of hair-cutters charged women more than men for a simple haircut.\nSection::::Gendered price disparities.:Vehicle insurance.\nThe price disparities between men and women in the vehicle insurance market is one of the few instances where men typically pay more than women for identical products and services. Unlike in the markets for retail or personal care products, however, these gender-based price differences can be rationally explained. Because men are believed in general to behave in more risky behaviors than women (driving at excessive speeds, driving recklessly, driving under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, etc.), the cost of insuring men is greater than the cost of insuring women, and this cost difference is reflected in insurance rates calculated in part on the gender of the insured.\nDespite vehicle insurance typically costing men more, there is some research to suggest that women actually pay more under the fixed annual pricing system because men drive more miles and are involved in twice as many accidents.\nSection::::Gendered price disparities.:Car price negotiations.\nFor most Americans, new car purchases are their largest consumer investment after buying a home. In 1991, Harvard Law Professor Ian Ayres examined whether the process of negotiating for a new car disadvantaged women and minorities. The study was conducted in the Chicago area and involved 180 price negotiations at 90 dealerships. The study's testers included individuals of different races and genders and each was instructed to use the same negotiation strategy. Each tester entered a car dealership and bargained to purchase a new car. The results of the study concluded that white males received significantly better prices than non-whites and women.\nSection::::Gendered price disparities.:Health insurance.\nWhile men engage in more risky health-related behaviors (smoking, drinking excessively, etc.), this is not reflected in the health insurance market, as women tend to pay more than men. Although the Affordable Care Act made gender-based differences in premium prices illegal, this disparity has continued to exist. One explanation for this is that women make more use of the health care services made available to them by their insurance. For example, women tend to use maternity care or take their children to the doctor."], "wikipedia-3411777": ["BULLET::::- Low-level processing (visual and auditory acuity, gender, age, mood, \u2026)"], "wikipedia-9844735": ["BULLET::::- Biases in perceptions of gendered computerized partners\nBULLET::::- The effects of confidence and self-efficacy on both genders\u2019 interactions with software.\nBULLET::::- The design of gender-specific software, such as video games created for women.\nBULLET::::- The design of display screen sizes and how they affect both genders.\nBULLET::::- The design of gender-neutral problem-solving software.\nBULLET::::1. \"Reward Expectations of Gendered Computers.\"\nBULLET::::- In one experiment, subjects worked on a task with a computerized partner that was named James or Julie.

The violence against women is a very serious issue that can be attributed to the death. For example, India recorded over 40,000 dowry-related deaths between 2011 and 2015. In Nepal and Bangladesh, the Asia Foundation points out that gender-based violence is the first or second cause of international homicides in these countries. One of the most noteworthy acts of historical violence against women was the institutionalization of \"comfort women\", the tens of thousands of young women\u2014a majority from Korea\u2014who were forced into sex slavery for the Japanese military during World War II.\n\nGendered violence in the Middle East greatly targets women and is justified by political and religious laws. Acts of gendered violence take the form of forced early marriage, rape, and domestic violence. Gendered violence can also be found in instances where Shariah, Islamic law, is used to justify killing women in order to preserve male honor. In Yemen, for example, 400 women were subjected to honor killings between 1996 and 1998. Ways in which women are held to a code of honor include the practice of wearing scarves (hijab) and refraining from using makeup, failure to do so can potentially result in physical and verbal harassment or loss of jobs. Scholars of Shariah make it justifiable to rape, beat, and sell non-Muslim women and girls.\n\nGendered violence exists in North America in forms such as stalking, intimate partner violence, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and sexual assault. Overall, women in North America are victims of sexual violence far more than men. Studies indicate that 82% of sexual assault survivors are women, while 98% of offenders are men. Additionally, women in North America are more likely than men to experience forms of sexual violence before the age of eighteen. Forms of intimate partner violence is experienced at a higher rate by women; this is not limited to sexual violence but included stalking and severe physical violence as well.\n\nA major cause of gendered violence in Central and South America comes from a high prevalence of gang affiliations and memberships. In the past, criminal gangs were viewed through a male-dominant perception but new research suggests recruitment and involvement of women in gangs is rapidly increasing. It used to be the case that women would support partners who were gang members, but now women are being used to commit crimes that were traditionally for men because their essence of innocence deters police. Despite women carrying out masculine roles within gangs, they are still the primary target of violence and face constant abuse by their partners.\n\nThe prevalence of violence against women is very severe in Africa where around one third of African women report experiencing domestic violence both physical and sexual.

Family members are also distinguihed by whether they are maternal or paternal and also by relative age. \nWhen the pronouns are used, speakers rely on context or the naming of the actor as man or woman or thing to specify who or what is being referred to. \nThe Ewe use a system of giving the first name to a child, based on the day of the week that the child was born and the gender it was assigned at birth. \nSection::::Other natural languages.:Basque.\nThe Basque language is largely gender-free. Most nouns have no gender, though there are different words for females and males in some cases (\"ama\", \"mother\"; \"aita\", \"father\"; \"guraso\", \"parent\"). Some words are differentiated according to gender, like in the English language (\"akt+oresa\", \"act+ress\"; \"akt+ore\", \"act+or\"), but they are not the main rule. For animals, there are particles (\"oil+o\", \"hen\"; \"oil+ar\", \"cock\"; \"hartz eme\", \"female bear\"; \"hartz arra\", \"male bear\") or different words (\"behi\", \"cow\"; \"zezen\", \"bull\").\nWhile there are no gender-specific pronouns, Basque verbs can agree allocutively with the gender in the intimate singular second person (this provides no information since the listener already knows the gender): \"hik dun\", \"you (female) have it\"; \"hik duk\", \"you (male) have it\". The verb is marked for addressee's gender, if they are intimate singular, whether or not they are referred to in the clause.\nNon-sexism supporters propose substituting those forms by the more formal ones: \"zuk duzu\" \"you have it\".\nIn earlier stages, the relation between \"hik\" and \"zuk\" was like that of \"you\" and \"thou\" in early modern English. Some Basque dialects already avoid \"hik\" as too disrespectful.\nSection::::Other natural languages.:Swahili.\nSwahili is a Bantu language spoken in many parts of Africa such as Kenya and Tanzania. It is largely gender neutral in specific nouns. Words such as actor/actress (mwigaji wa hadithi) and waiter/waitress (mtumishi mezani) are gender neutral among most others in the language. The words he, him, she, her translate to a single word in Swahili, yeye.\nThere are gender specific words for man/woman (mwanadamu/wanawake) and mother/father (mama/baba), so it is not completely gender neutral, although a vast majority of the words do not distinguish between male or female. The language does not have a grammatical gender either.\nSection::::Other natural languages.:Chinese.\nThe Chinese language or languages/topolects are largely gender-neutral, and possess few linguistic gender markers.\nComprehension of written and spoken Chinese is almost wholly dependent on word order, as it has no inflections for gender, tense, or case. There are also very few derivational inflections; instead, the language relies heavily on compounding to create new words. A Chinese word is thus inherently gender-neutral, but any given word can be preceded by an adjective/root indicating masculinity or femininity. For example, the word for \"doctor\" is \"y\u012bsh\u0113ng\" (\u91ab\u751f or \u533b\u751f) and can only be made gender-specific by adding the root for \"male\" or \"female\" to the front of it; thus to specify a male doctor, one would need to prefix \"n\u00e1n\" \u7537 (male), as in \"n\u00e1ny\u012bsh\u0113ng\" (\u7537\u91ab\u751f or \u7537\u533b\u751f). Under normal circumstances, both male and female doctors would simply be referred to as \"y\u012bsh\u0113ng\" (\u91ab\u751f or \u533b\u751f\uff09.\nSpoken Mandarin Chinese also has only one third-person pronoun, \"t\u0101\" for all referents (though \"-men\" \u5011 / \u4eec can be added as a plural suffix). \"T\u0101\" can mean \"he\", \"she\", or \"it\". However, the different meanings of \"t\u0101\" are written with different characters: \"\u4ed6\", containing the human radical \"\u4ebb\", from \"\u4eba\", meaning person, for \"he\" or a person of undetermined gender; \"\u5979\", containing the feminine radical \"\u5973\", for \"she\"; and \"\u5b83\" for \"it\"; \"\u7942\" containing the spirit radical \"\u793b\", from \"\u793a\", for deities; \"\u7260\" containing the cow radical \"\u725c\", from \"\u725b\", for animals.\nThe character for \"she\", containing the \"woman\" radical (glyphic element of a character's composition), was invented in the early twentieth century due to western influence; prior to this, the character indicating \"he\" today was used for both genders\u00a0\u2014 it contains the \"person\" radical, which, as noted above, is not gender-specific.\nSection::::Other natural languages.:Chinese.:Cantonese.\nIn written Cantonese, the third-person singular pronoun is \"keui\", written as \u4f62; it may be used to refer to people of either gender because Chinese does not have gender roles as English in third-person pronouns. The practice of replacing the \"\u4ebb\" radical with \"\u5973\" (forming the character \u59d6) to specifically indicate the female gender may also be seen occasionally in informal writing; however, this is neither widely accepted nor grammatically or semantically required, and the character \u59d6 has a separate meaning in standard Chinese.\nSection::::Other natural languages.:Pipil.\nPipil, like other Uto-Aztecan languages, is a gender-neutral language. The word \"yaja\" is gender-neutral and means both \"she\" and \"he\". Even though, the preffix \"siwa\" can be added to the end of some words (mostly family roles) to make them feminine, these nouns are in their basic form gender-neutral: \"piltzin\" (boy, son), \"siwapiltzin\" (daughter). This is rather common. Nevertheless, most of the professions are gender-neutral: \"tamachtiani\" (teacher), \"tisewiani\" (fireman or firewoman, firefighter), \"tapajtiani\" (medic, doctor), \"takwikani\" (singer), \"tasumani\" (soldier), \"mutaluani\" (runner), even \"tajkwiluani\" (writer). Some exceptions concerning gender would be \"siwateutzin\" (goddess) and \"siwataktuani\" (queen).\nThe only definite article in Pipil is the word \"ne\", denoting person(s) or thing(s) already mentioned, under discussion, implied, or otherwise presumed familiar to the listener or reader.\n\"Ne\" can be used with both singular and plural nouns, with nouns of any gender, and with nouns that start with any letter. This is different from many other languages, which have different articles in those situations.\nSection::::Other natural languages.:Quechuan.\nQuechuan languages, spoken in the central Andes, are agglutinative using only suffixes, but have no gender suffix.\nWith the exception of \"mama\" and \"tata\", and \"wallpa\" and \"k'anka\" (hen and rooster), no nouns are gender-specific. In Southern Quechuan, \"qhari\" (man) and \"warmi\" (woman) are very seldom used along with a noun referring to a person, as in \"warmi wawa\" and \"qhari wawa\" for daughter and son. For animals \"urqu\" and \"china\" serve the same purpose, as in \"urqu khuchi\" and \"china khuchi\" for pig and sow.\nNo pronouns distinguish gender, the third singular \"pay\" being he/she/it.\nSection::::Other natural languages.:Dravidian languages.\nDravidian languages have a gender-neutral form for the third-person plural, which is also used for the third-person singular in all formal communication. Most job titles are derived from this form as they are mostly used in a formal context. They are thus gender-free. It is commonly used to address also, people of higher status, age or stature.\nSection::::Constructed languages.\nSection::::Constructed languages.:Esperanto.\nEsperanto follows the pattern of more natural languages in assigning the male genders to specific roles (family member, aristocracy, etc.), and further deriving the female term from that. The generic form of nouns is the same as the male form and different from the female form\u2014for example, ' means \"doctor(s)\" (male or unspecified sex), while ' means \"female doctor\". Some words, like \"\" (father), are intrinsically masculine, but there is no root word to express \"a parent\".\nThe prefix \"ge-\" may be used for groups of mixed sex, for example, \"\" (male and female doctors). Reformers have used \"ge-\" to create explicitly sex-neutral singulars such as \"gepatro\", \"a parent\". Though not generally adopted, this usage has appeared in some authoritative reference", "Explicitly marked feminine forms such as ' may be used to emphasize the noun's female character, but unmarked forms are also commonly used for females. Reformers have proposed morphologically well-formed but rarely used forms like ' (literally \"man-doctor\") and neologisms like \"-i\u0109-\" (') to emphasize maleness. The first form is somewhat insufficient because ' traditionally means \"man, male\", but does not really show any male lexeme or morpheme, ' meaning \"woman\". This is discussed about, some people prefer ' for \"man, male\" as opposed to \"\".\nConcerning pronouns there is much discussion: \"\u015di\" is clearly female, like English \"she\". For male persons \"li\" is used and for (not personified) animals as well as for inanimate objects \"\u011di\". It is not clear however what form to use when a person of unknown sex is spoken of. It is officially accepted, though very rarely practiced, to use \"\u011di\" in this case. Also \"li\" is officially accepted to refer to both sexes, what of course causes some opposition. There are some suggestions for neologisms like \"\u015dli\" or \"ri\". On the other hand, some people consider \"li\" to be sex-neutral, and recommend a new only-male pronoun, e.\u00a0g. \"hi\".\nArguments about the character and implications of \"gendered\" or \"sexist\" features in Esperanto closely parallel those raised for other, particularly European languages.\nSection::::Constructed languages.:Ido.\nIn Ido, only two couples of nouns are gender-specific: viro-muliero (man-woman) and patro-matro (father-mother). Other nouns referring to people, and all nouns referring to animals can equally be used to refer to a male or female: doktoro (a doctor), frato (a brother or a sister, i.e.: a sibling), hundo (a dog). And even the two pairs of words above have related nouns that are ambiguous about gender: homo (a human being), adulto (an adult person), genitoro (a parent).\nWhen it is necessary to specify the gender, the suffixes \"-in\" for females, and \"-ul\" for males is inserted right before the final \"-o\" of any noun referring to either human beings or animals. Thus, from frato (sibling) the words fratino (a sister) and fratulo (a brother) can be obtained. However these forms are to be used only if the gender is relevant for the context, as in the following examples:\nBULLET::::- \"El esas mea sola fratino.\" (She is my only sister [implying I may have brothers])\nBULLET::::- \"El esas mea sola frato.\" (She is my only sibling)\nBULLET::::- \"Me ne prizas doktorini.\" (I don't like female doctors [implying I prefer male doctors])\nBULLET::::- \"Me ne prizas doktori.\" (I don't like doctors [male or female])\nAs for pronouns, they are not gender-specific in the first or second persons, singular and plural. In the third person singular, there are four pronouns (the U between brackets can be used or left out, mostly according to personal choice): il(u) (he), el(u) (she), ol(u) (it, when it refers back to an actual inanimate noun, and not in sentences as \"It's raining\"), and additionally lu, which can be used instead of any of the other three pronouns, whether it be for stylistic purposes, personal choice, or to refer to an indefinite being (usually human or animal) that can be thought of indifferently as male or female. For example:\nMea kapo doloras. Me advokos doktoro e lu decidez quon me agos\nSince I don't know whether a male or female doctor will come, I cannot use here il(u) or el(u). And I definitely cannot use ol(u) since I know for a fact that the doctor who comes is going to be a human being.\nNow if instead of \"a\" doctor, I decided to call \"my\" doctor (therefore, knowing whether it will be a man or a woman), I could use any of the following:\n1.- Mea kapo doloras. Me advokos mea doktoro ed il decidez quon me agos\n2.- Mea kapo doloras. Me advokos mea doktoro ed el decidez quon me agos\n3.- Mea kapo doloras. Me advokos mea doktoro e lu decidez quon me agos\nIn sentence number 1, the doctor is a man, so the masculine pronoun is used. In sentence number 2, the doctor is a woman, so the noun is referred back with a feminine pronoun. But in sentence number 3, even though I know if the doctor is a man or a woman, it is perfectly possible to still dodge the definition by using the always available gender-neutral pronoun lu. Notice however that doktoro is never marked for gender in these sentences, since the doctor will be called in his/her professional capacity, and not for being a man or a woman. Actually, saying Me advokos mea doktorino (or mea doktorulo) implies I have a choice between a male and a female doctor, and I have decided on either of them.\nIn the third person plural, all of these pronouns have a correlative: ili, eli, and oli (only if a group of men, women or inanimate things or concepts respectively is referred). And li if no gender-specificity is required or even possible (for example, if the pronoun refers to a group including both men and women). In practice, the first three pronouns are usually avoided unless a point wants to be made as to the gender of the people referred, or in complex sentences, where gender information is given to clarify the meaning. For example:\n\"La matri e sua filii recevis la premio quan eli decidis\".\n(\"The mothers and their children received the prize they -i.e.: the mothers, not the children- decided\", provided that the children are not all girls).\n\"Me pruntis ta libri de mea amiki, e nun me ne povas trovar oli (\"I borrowed those books from my friends, and now I can't find them \"-i.e.: the books, not the friends who are not inanimate beings that can be referred back with oli\").\nSection::::Constructed languages.:Lingua Franca Nova.\nLingua Franca Nova completely lacks grammatical gender. The word \"el\" means \"she/her\" and \"he/him\", and \"lo\" is used for \"it\". If gender is significant, one may use words such as \"la fem, la om, la xica, la xico,\" etc. (the woman, the man, the girl, the boy).\nTerms for various professions are gender neutral, as are terms for animals. If need be, \"mas\" or \"fema\" can be used as adjectives for \"male\" and \"female\", respectively. Certain traditional roles have \"-esa\" for the female, such as \"prinsesa, contesa,\" etc. Most family terms distinguish male and female by varying the final vowel, such as \"tia/tio, fia/fio, ava/avo\" etc. (aunt/uncle, daughter/son, grandmother/grandfather). Only \"madre/padre\" and \"sore/frate\" (mother/father, sister/brother) use distinct terms.\nSection::::Constructed languages.:Interlingua.\nInterlingua is an auxiliary language that was developed to have a widely international vocabulary and a very simple grammar. In Interlingua, nouns have no gender except to reflect natural sex. For example, the words \"homine\" (man) and \"femina\" (woman) are masculine and feminine, respectively, but \"persona\" (person) has no gender. Adjectives are invariable and so never have to agree in gender with the nouns they modify. There is a separate nongender pronoun (\"illo\", \"it\") and the possessive pronoun \"su\" (\"his\", \"her\" or \"its\") is gender-neutral.\nNouns such as \"professor\" and \"conductor\" denote both men and women, but specifically feminine forms such as \"professora\" \"conductora\" have been used occasionally over time. Interlingua has largely escaped charges of sexism, perhaps because the language changes easily as social values change."], "wikipedia-1305554": ["Examples include a greater male tendencies toward violence, or that the female brain appears to have a strong affinity for empathy.\nMany different studies have been conducted on sex differences in the play behavior of young children, often yielding conflicting results. One study conducted on nineteen-month-old children revealed a male preference for stereotypically \"masculine\" toys, and a female preference for stereotypically \"feminine\" toys, with males showing more variance in play behavior. A study of thirteen-month-old children supported the theory that males and females typically prefer toys typed to their gender, but instead found females showing more variance instead of males. An additional study found that a gendered divide in regards to toys may express itself as early as nine-months of age. Despite these apparent differences, a study of toddlers showed that both boys and girls were equally active when playing, and both sexes preferred toys that allowed them to express this.\nThe specific cause of this sex difference has also been investigated. A study with 112 boys and 100 girls found that the difference in play behavior appeared to be semi-correlated with fetal testosterone. Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and thus exposed to high androgen levels during pregnancy tend to play more with male-typical toys and less with female-typical ones. However, some have argued that the characteristics of the condition itself could also result in those girls preferring different types of toys.\nOne study also claimed that one-day-old girls gaze longer at a face, whereas suspended mechanical mobiles, rather than a face, keep boys' attention for longer, though this study has been criticized as having methodological flaws.\nResearch has shown that when male-typical toys are labeled as female-appropriate, young girls become significantly more likely to play with them. Certain studies have concluded that many end up treating infants and toddlers differently based on their assumed gender, even if boys and girls express the same behavior. Children raised by lesbian mothers were reported by the parents to be more androgynous in personality, suggesting that, if the reporting is accurate, upbringing could influence certain gendered traits.\nHuman-like play preferences have also been observed in guenon and rhesus macaques, though the co-author of the latter study warned about over-interpreting the data.\nPsychological theories exist regarding the development and expression of gender differences in human sexuality. A number of these theories are consistent in predicting that men should be more approving of casual sex (sex happening outside a stable, committed relationship such as marriage) and should also be more promiscuous (have a higher number of sexual partners) than women:\nA sociobiological approach applies evolutionary biology to human sexuality, emphasizing reproductive success in shaping patterns of sexual behavior. According to sociobiologists, since women's parental investment in reproduction is greater than men's, owing to human sperm being much more plentiful than eggs, and the fact that women must devote considerable energy to gestating their offspring, women will tend to be much more selective in their choice of mates than men. It may not be possible to accurately test sociobiological theories in relation to promiscuity and casual sex in contemporary (U.S.) society, which is quite different from the ancestral human societies in which most natural selection for sexual traits has occurred.\nNeoanalytic theories are based on the observation that mothers, as opposed to fathers, bear the major responsibility for childcare in most families and cultures; both male and female infants therefore form an intense emotional attachment to their mother, a woman. According to feminist psychoanalytic theorist Nancy Chodorow, girls tend to preserve this attachment throughout life and define their identities in relational terms, whereas boys must reject this maternal attachment in order to develop a masculine identity. In addition, this theory predicts that women's economic dependence on men in a male-dominated society will tend to cause women to approve of sex more in committed relationships providing economic security, and less so in casual relationships.\nThe Sexual Strategies Theory by David Buss and David P. Schmitt is an evolutionary psychology theory regarding female and male short-term and long-term mating strategies which they argued are dependent on several different goals and vary depending on the environment. Terri D. Conley et al. has argued that other empirical evidence support smaller or non-existing gender differences and social theories such as stigma, socialization, and double standards.\nAccording to social learning theory, sexuality is influenced by people's social environment. This theory suggests that sexual attitudes and behaviors are learned through observation of role models such as parents and media figures, as well as through positive or negative reinforcements for behaviors that match or defy established gender roles. It predicts that gender differences in sexuality can change over time as a function of changing social norms, and also that a societal double standard in punishing women more severely than men (who may in fact be rewarded) for engaging in promiscuous or casual sex will lead to significant gender differences in attitudes and behaviors regarding sexuality.\nSuch a societal double standard also figures in social role theory, which suggests that sexual attitudes and behaviors are shaped by the roles that men and women are expected to fill in society, and script theory, which focuses on the symbolic meaning of behaviors; this theory suggests that social conventions influence the meaning of specific acts, such as male sexuality being tied more to individual pleasure and macho stereotypes (therefore predicting a high number of casual sexual encounters) and female sexuality being tied more to the quality of a committed relationship.", "better on verbal abilities while males performed better on visuospatial abilities. One female advantage is in verbal fluency where they have been found to perform better in vocabulary, reading comprehension, speech production and essay writing. Males have been specifically found to perform better on spatial visualization, spatial perception, and mental rotation. Researchers had then recommended that general models such as fluid and crystallized intelligence be divided into verbal, perceptual and visuospatial domains of g, because when this model is applied then females excel at verbal and perceptual tasks while males on visuospatial tasks.\nThere are however also differences in the capacity of males and females in performing certain tasks, such as rotation of objects in space, often categorized as \"spatial ability\". Other traditionally male advantages, such as in the field of mathematics are less clear. Although females have lesser performance in spatial abilities, they have better performance in processing speed involving letters, digits and rapid naming tasks, object location memory, verbal memory, and also verbal learning.\nSection::::Psychological traits.:Memory.\nThe results from research on sex differences in memory are mixed and inconsistent, with some studies showing no difference, and others showing a female or male advantage. Most studies have found no sex differences in short term memory, the rate of memory decline due to aging, or memory of visual stimuli. Females have been found to have an advantage in recalling auditory and olfactory stimuli, experiences, faces, names, and the location of objects in space. However, males show an advantage in recalling \"masculine\" events. A study examining sex differences in performance on the California Verbal Learning Test found that males performed better on Digit Span Backwards and on reaction time, while females were better on short-term memory recall and Symbol-Digit Modalities Test. Females have also demonstrated to have better verbal memory.\nA study was conducted to explore regions within the brain that are activated during working memory tasks in males versus females. Four different tasks of increasing difficulty were given to 9 males and 8 females. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure brain activity. The lateral prefrontal cortices, the parietal cortices and caudates were activated in both genders. With more difficult tasks, more brain tissue was activated. The left hemisphere was predominantly activated in females' brains, whereas there was bilateral activation in males' brains.\nSection::::Psychological traits.:Aggression.\nAlthough research on sex differences in aggression show that males are generally more likely to display aggression than females, how much of this is due to social factors and gender expectations is unclear. Aggression is closely linked with cultural definitions of \"masculine\" and \"feminine\". In some situations, women show equal or more aggression than men, although less physical; for example, women are more likely to use direct aggression in private, where other people cannot see them, and are more likely to use indirect aggression in public. Men are more likely to be the targets of displays of aggression and provocation than females. Studies by Bettencourt and Miller show that when provocation is controlled for, sex differences in aggression are greatly reduced. They argue that this shows that gender-role norms play a large part in the differences in aggressive behavior between men and women. Psychologist Anne Campbell argues that females are more likely to use indirect aggression, and that \"cultural interpretations have 'enhanced' evolutionarily based sex differences by a process of imposition which stigmatises the expression of aggression by females and causes women to offer exculpatory (rather than justificatory) accounts of their own aggression\".\nAccording to the 2015 \"International encyclopedia of the social and behavioral sciences\"\", sex differences in aggression is one of the most robust and oldest findings in psychology. Past meta-analyses in the encyclopedia found males regardless of age engaged in more physical and verbal aggression while small effect for females engaging in more indirect aggression such as rumor spreading or gossiping. It also found males tend to engage in more unprovoked aggression at higher frequency than females. This replicated another 2007 meta-analysis of 148 studies in the journal of \"Child Development\" which found greater male aggression in childhood and adolescence. This analysis also conforms with the \"Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology\" which reviewed past analysis and found greater male use in verbal and physical aggression with the difference being greater in the physical type. A meta-analysis of 122 studies published in the journal of \"Aggressive Behavior\" found males are more likely to cyber-bully than females. Difference also showed that females reported more cyber bullying behaviour during mid-adolescence while males showed more cyber bullying behaviour at late adolescence.\nThe relationship between testosterone and aggression is unclear, and a causal link has not been conclusively shown. Some studies indicate that testosterone levels may be affected by environmental and social influences. The relationship is difficult to study since the only reliable measure of brain testosterone is from a lumbar puncture which is not done for research purposes and many studies have instead used less reliable measures such as blood testosterone. In humans, males engage in crime and especially violent crime more than females. The involvement in crime usually rises in the early teens to mid teens which happen at the same time as testosterone levels rise. Most studies support a link between adult criminality and testosterone although the relationship is modest if examined separately for each sex. However, nearly all studies of juvenile delinquency and testosterone are not significant. Most studies have also found testosterone to be associated with behaviors or personality traits linked with criminality such as antisocial behavior and alcoholism.\nIn species that have high levels of male physical competition and aggression over females, males tend to be larger and stronger than females. Humans have modest general body sexual dimorphism on characteristics such as height and body mass. However, this may understate the sexual dimorphism regarding characteristics related to aggression since females have large fat stores. The sex differences are greater for muscle mass and especially for upper body muscle mass. Men's skeleton, especially in the vulnerable face, is more robust. Another possible explanation, instead of intra-species aggression, for this sexual dimorphism may be that it is an adaption for a sexual division of labor with males doing the hunting. However, the hunting theory may have difficulty explaining differences regarding features such as stronger protective skeleton, beards (not helpful in hunting, but they increase the perceived size of the jaws and perceived dominance, which may be helpful in intra-species male competition), and greater male ability at interception (greater targeting ability can be explained by hunting).\nThere are evolutionary theories regarding male aggression in specific areas such as sociobiological theories of rape and theories regarding the high degree of abuse against stepchildren (the Cinderella effect). Another evolutionary theory explaining gender differences in aggression is the male warrior hypothesis, which explains that males have psychologically evolved for intergroup aggression in order to gain access to mates, resources, territory and status.\nSection::::Psychological traits.:Personality traits.\nCross-cultural research has shown gender differences on the tests measuring sociability and emotionality. For example, on the scales measured by the Big Five personality traits women consistently report higher Neuroticism, agreeableness, warmth (an extraversion facet) and openness to feelings, and men often report higher assertiveness (a facet of extraversion) and openness to ideas as assessed by the NEO-PI-R. Gender differences in personality traits are largest in prosperous, healthy, and egalitarian cultures in which women have more opportunities that are equal to those of men. Differences in the magnitude of sex differences between more or less developed world regions were due to differences between men, not women, in these respective regions. That is, men in highly developed world regions were less neurotic, extroverted, conscientious and agreeable compared to men in less developed world regions. Women, on the other hand tended not to differ in personality traits across regions. Researchers have speculated that resource poor environments (that is, countries with low levels of development) may inhibit the development of gender differences, whereas resource rich environments facilitate them. This may be because males require more resources than females in order to reach their full developmental potential. The authors argued that due to different evolutionary pressures, men may have evolved to be more risk-taking and socially dominant, whereas women evolved to be more cautious and nurturant. Hunter-gatherer societies in which humans originally evolved may have been more egalitarian than later agriculturally oriented societies. Hence, the development of gender inequalities may have acted to constrain the development of gender differences in personality that originally evolved in hunter-gatherer societies. As modern societies have become more egalitarian again it may be that innate sex differences are no longer constrained and hence manifest more fully than in less developed cultures. Currently, this hypothesis remains untested, as gender differences in modern societies have not been compared with those in hunter-gatherer societies.\nA personality trait directly linked to emotion and empathy where gender differences exist (see below) is Machiavellianism. Individuals who score high on this dimension are emotionally cool; this allows them to detach from others as well as values, and act egoistically rather than driven by affect, empathy or morality. In large samples of US college students males are on average more Machiavellian than females; in particular, males are over-represented among very high Machiavellians, while females are overrepresented among low Machiavellians. A 2014 meta-analysis by researchers Rebecca Friesdorf and Paul Conway found that men score significantly higher on narcissism than women and this finding is robust across past literature. The meta-analysis included 355 studies measuring narcissism across participants from the US, Germany, China, Netherlands, Italy, UK, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Australia and Belgium as well as measuring latent factors from 124 additional studies. The researchers noted that gender differences in narcissism is not just a measurement artifact but also represents true differences in the latent personality traits such as men's heightened sense of entitlement and authority.\nMeta-analytic studies have also found males on average to be more assertive and having higher self-esteem...", "males in extraversion, anxiety, trust, and, especially, tender-mindedness (e.g., nurturance). Women have also been found to be more punishment sensitive and men higher in sensation seeking and behavioural risk-taking. Deficits in effortful control also showed a very modest effect size in the male direction.\nA meta-analysis of scientific studies concluded that men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people. When interests were classified by RIASEC type Holland Codes (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional), men showed stronger Realistic and Investigative interests, and women showed stronger Artistic, Social, and Conventional interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering, science, and mathematics interests.\nSection::::Psychological traits.:Empathy.\nCurrent literature find that women demonstrate more empathy across studies. Women perform better than men in tests involving emotional interpretation, such as understanding facial expressions, and empathy.\nSome studies argue that this is related to the subject's perceived gender identity and gender expectations. Additionally, culture impacts gender differences in the expression of emotions. This may be explained by the different social roles women and men have in different cultures, and by the status and power men and women hold in different societies, as well as the different cultural values various societies hold. Some studies have found no differences in empathy between women and men, and suggest that perceived gender differences are the result of motivational differences. Some researchers argue that because differences in empathy disappear on tests where it is not clear that empathy is being studied, men and women do not differ in ability, but instead in how empathetic they would like to appear to themselves and others.\nA review published in the journal \"Neuropsychologia\" found that women are better at recognizing facial effects, expression processing and emotions in general. Men were only better at recognizing specific behaviour which includes anger, aggression and threatening cues. A 2006 meta-analysis by researcher Rena A Kirkland from the \"North American Journal of Psychology\" found significant sex differences favouring females in \"Reading of the mind\" test. \"Reading of the mind\" test is an ability measure of theory of mind or cognitive empathy in which Kirkland's analysis involved 259 studies across 10 countries. Another 2014 meta-analysis in the journal of \"Cognition and Emotion\", found overall female advantage in non-verbal emotional recognition across 215 samples.\nAn analysis from the journal of \"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews\" found that there are sex differences in empathy from birth which remains consistent and stable across lifespan. Females were found to have higher empathy than males while children with higher empathy regardless of gender continue to be higher in empathy throughout development. Further analysis of brain tools such as event related potentials found that females who saw human suffering had higher ERP waveforms than males. Another investigation with similar brain tools such as N400 amplitudes found higher N400 in females in response to social situations which positively correlated with self-reported empathy. Structural fMRI studies found females have larger grey matter volumes in posterior inferior frontal and anterior inferior parietal cortex areas which are correlated with mirror neurons in fMRI literature. Females were also found to have stronger link between emotional and cognitive empathy. The researchers found that the stability of these sex differences in development are unlikely to be explained by any environment influences but rather might have some roots in human evolution and inheritance.\nAn evolutionary explanation for the difference is that understanding and tracking relationships and reading others' emotional states was particularly important for women in prehistoric societies for tasks such as caring for children and social networking. Throughout prehistory, females nurtured and were the primary caretakers of children so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions. According to the \"Primary Caretaker Hypothesis\", prehistoric males did not have same selective pressure as primary caretakers so therefore this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.\nSection::::Psychological traits.:Emotion.\nWhen measured with an affect intensity measure, women reported greater intensity of both positive and negative affect than men. Women also reported a more intense and more frequent experience of affect, joy, and love but also experienced more embarrassment, guilt, shame, sadness, anger, fear, and distress. Experiencing pride was more frequent and intense for men than for women. In imagined frightening situations, such as being home alone and witnessing a stranger walking towards your house, women reported greater fear. Women also reported more fear in situations that involved \"a male's hostile and aggressive behavior\" (281) In anger-eliciting situations, women communicated more intense feelings of anger than men. Women also reported more intense feelings of anger in relation to terrifying situations, especially situations involving a male protagonist.\nEmotional contagion refers to the phenomenon of a person's emotions becoming similar to those of surrounding people. Women have been reported to be more responsive to this.\nWomen are stereotypically more emotional and men are stereotypically angrier. When lacking substantial emotion information they can base judgments on, people tend to rely more on gender stereotypes. Results from a study conducted by Robinson and colleagues implied that gender stereotypes are more influential when judging others' emotions in a hypothetical situation.\nThere are documented differences in socialization that could contribute to sex differences in emotion and to differences in patterns of brain activity. An American Psychological Association article states that, \"boys are generally expected to suppress emotions and to express anger through violence, rather than constructively\". A child development researcher at Harvard University argues that boys are taught to shut down their feelings, such as empathy, sympathy and other key components of what is deemed to be pro-social behavior. According to this view, differences in emotionality between the sexes are theoretically only socially-constructed, rather than biological. \nOn the other hand, women cry more than men in wealthier, more democratic, and feminine countries.\nContext also determines a man or woman's emotional behavior. Context-based emotion norms, such as feeling rules or display rules, \"prescribe emotional experience and expressions in specific situations like a wedding or a funeral\", independent of the person's gender. In situations like a wedding or a funeral, the activated emotion norms apply to and constrain every person in the situation. Gender differences are more pronounced when situational demands are very small or non-existent as well as in ambiguous situations. During these situations, gender norms \"are the default option that prescribes emotional behavior\" (290-1).\nScientists in the field distinguish between emotionality and the expression of emotion: Associate Professor of psychology Ann Kring said, \"It is incorrect to make a blanket statement that women are more emotional than men, it is correct to say that women show their emotions more than men.\" In two studies by Kring, women were found to be more facially expressive than men when it came to both positive and negative emotions. These researchers concluded that women and men experience the same amount of emotion, but that women are more likely to express their emotions.\nWomen are known to have anatomically differently shaped tear glands than men as well as having more of the hormone prolactin, which is present in tear glands, as adults. While girls and boys cry at roughly the same amount at age 12, by age 18, women generally cry four times more than men, which could be explained by higher levels of prolactin.\nWomen show significantly greater activity in the left amygdala when encoding and remembering emotionally disturbing pictures (such as mutilated bodies). Men and women tend to use different neural pathways to encode stimuli into memory. While highly emotional pictures were remembered best by all participants in one study, as compared to emotionally neutral images, women remembered the pictures better than men. This study also found greater activation of the right amygdala in men and the left amygdala in women. On average, women use more of the left cerebral hemisphere when shown emotionally arousing images, while men use more of their right hemisphere. Women also show more consistency between individuals for the areas of the brain activated by emotionally disturbing images.\nA 2003 worldwide survey by the Pew Research Center found that overall women stated that they were somewhat happier than men with their lives. Compared to the previous report five years earlier women more often reported progress with their lives while men were more optimistic about the future. Women were more concerned about home and family issues than men who were more concerned about issues outside the home. Men were happier than women regarding family life and more optimistic regarding the children's future.\nResearch has shown that women are more likely than men to use emoticons in text messaging.\nSection::::Psychological traits.:Ethics and moral orientation.\nMeta-analysis on sex differences of moral orientation have found that women tend towards a more \"care\" based morality while men tend towards a more \"justice\" based morality. This is usually based on the fact that men have a more slight utilitarian reasoning while women have more deontological reasoning which is largely because of greater female affective response and rejection of harm-based behaviours. A meta-analysis published in the 2013 journal of \"Ethics and Behaviour\" after reviewing 19 primary studies also found women have greater moral sensitivity than men.\nSection::::Psychological traits.:Mental health.\nChildhood conduct disorder and adult antisocial personality disorder as well as substance use disorders are more common in men. Many mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders are more common in women. One explanation is that men tend to externalize stress while women tend to internalize it. Gender differences vary to some degree for different cultures. Women are more likely than men to show unipolar depression. One 1987 study found little empirical support for several proposed explanations, including biological ones, and argued that when depressed women tend to ruminate which may lower the mood further while men tend to distract themselves with activities. This may develop from women and men being raised differently.\nMen and women do not differ on their overall rates of psychopathology; however, certain disorders are more prevalent in women, and vice versa", "Women have higher rates of anxiety and depression (internalizing disorders) and men have higher rates of substance abuse and antisocial disorders (externalizing disorders). It is believed that divisions of power and the responsibilities set upon each sex are critical to this predisposition. Namely, women earn less money than men do, they tend to have jobs with less power and autonomy, and women are more responsive to problems of people in their social networks. These three differences can contribute to women's predisposition to anxiety and depression. It is suggested that socializing practices that encourage high self-regard and mastery would benefit the mental health of both women and men.\nOne study interviewed 18,572 respondents, aged 18 and over, about 15 phobic symptoms. These symptoms would yield diagnoses based on criteria for agoraphobia, social phobia, and simple phobia. Women had significantly higher prevalence rates of agoraphobia and simple phobia; however, there were no differences found between men and women in social phobia. The most common phobias for both women and men involved spiders, bugs, mice, snakes, and heights. The biggest differences between men and women in these disorders were found on the agoraphobic symptoms of 'going out of the house alone' and 'being alone', and on two simple phobic symptoms, involving the fear of 'any harmless or dangerous animal' and 'storms', with relatively more women having both phobias. There were no differences in the age of onset, reporting a fear on the phobic level, telling a doctor about symptoms, or the recall of past symptoms.\nOne study interviewed 2,181 people in Detroit, aged 18\u201345, seeking to explain gender differences in exposure to traumatic events and in the development or emergence of post traumatic stress disorder following this exposure. It was found that lifetime prevalence of traumatic events was a little higher in men than in women. However, following exposure to a traumatic event, the risk for PTSD was two times higher in women. It is believed this difference is due to the greater risk women have of developing PTSD after a traumatic event that involved assaultive violence. In fact, the probability of a woman developing PTSD following assaultive violence was 36% compared to 6% of men. The duration of PTSD is longer in women, as well.\nWomen and men are both equally likely at developing symptoms of schizophrenia, but the onset occurs earlier for men. It has been suggested that sexually dimorphic brain anatomy, the differential effects of estrogens and androgens, and the heavy exposure of male adolescents to alcohol and other toxic substances can lead to this earlier onset in men. It is believed that estrogens have a protective effect against the symptoms of schizophrenia. Although, it has been shown that other factors can contribute to the delayed onset and symptoms in women, estrogens have a large effect, as can be seen during a pregnancy. In pregnancy, estrogen levels are rising in women, so women who have had recurrent acute episodes of schizophrenia did not usually break down. However, after pregnancy, when estrogen levels have dropped, women tend to suffer from postpartum psychoses. Also, psychotic symptoms are exacerbated when, during the menstrual cycle, estrogen levels are at their lowest. In addition, estrogen treatment has yielded beneficial effects in patients with schizophrenia.\nPathological gambling has been known to have a higher prevalence rate, 2:1, in men to women. One study chose to identify gender-related differences by examining male and female gamblers, who were using a gambling helpline. There was 562 calls placed, and of this amount, 62.1% were men, and 37.9% were women. Male gamblers were more likely to report problems with strategic forms of gambling (blackjack or poker), and female gamblers were more likely to report problems with nonstrategic forms, such as slots or bingo. Male gamblers were also more likely to report a longer duration of gambling than women. Female gamblers were more likely to report receiving mental health treatment that was not related to gambling. Male gamblers were more likely to report a drug problem or being arrested on account of gambling. There were high rates of debt and psychiatric symptoms related to gambling observed in both groups of men and women.\nThere are also differences regarding gender and suicide. Males in Western societies are much more likely to die from suicide despite females having more suicide attempts.\nThe 'extreme male brain theory' views autism and the Asperger syndrome as an extreme version of male-female differences regarding 'systemizing' and empathizing abilities. The 'imprinted brain theory' argues that autism and psychosis are contrasting disorders on a number of different variables and that this is caused by an unbalanced genomic imprinting favoring paternal genes (autism) or maternal genes (psychosis).\nSection::::Psychological traits.:Cognitive control of behavior.\nFemales tend to have a greater basal capacity to exert inhibitory control over undesired or habitual behaviors than males and respond differently to modulatory environmental contextual factors. For example, listening to music tends to significantly improve the rate of response inhibition in females, but reduce the rate of response inhibition in males. A 2010 meta-analyses found that women have small, but persistent, advantages in punishment sensitivity and effortful control across cultures. A 2014 review found that In humans, women discount more steeply than men, but sex differences on measures of impulsive action depend on tasks and subject samples.", "In the cerebral cortex, it has been observed that there is greater \"intra\"-lobe neural communication in male brains and greater \"inter\"-lobe (between the left and right hemispheres of the cerebral cortex) neural communication in female brains. In the cerebellum, the region of the brain that plays an important role in motor functions, males showed higher connectivity between hemispheres, and females showed higher connectivity within hemispheres. This potentially provides a neural basis for previous studies that showed sex-specific difference in certain psychological functions. Females on average outperform males on emotional recognition and nonverbal reasoning tests, while males outperform females on motor and spatial cognitive tests.\n\nIn the work of Szalkai et al. have computed structural (i.e., anatomical) connectomes of 96 subjects of the Human Connectome Project, and they have shown that in several deep graph-theoretical parameters, the structural connectome of women is significantly better connected than that of men. For example, women's connectome has more edges, higher minimum bipartition width, larger eigengap, greater minimum vertex cover than that of men. The minimum bipartition width (or the minimum balanced cut (see Cut (graph theory))) is a well-known measure of quality of computer multistage interconnection networks, it describes the possible bottlenecks in network communication: the higher this value is, the better is the network. The larger eigengap shows that the female connectome is a better expander graph than the connectome of males. The better expanding property, the higher minimum bipartition width and the greater minimum vertex cover show deep advantages in network connectivity in the case of female braingraph. Szalkai et al. have also shown that most of the deep graph theoretical differences remain in effect if big-brained women and small-brained men are compared: i.e., the graph theoretical differences are due to sex, and not the brain volume-differences of the subjects."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This is because manufacturers (especially manufacturers of clothing and cosmetics) specifically produce products for either a male or female market and the wants and needs of either gender are very different.

It involves targeting the gender which advertisers believe their product will appeal more to. This generally is an effective way to market because men and women have some contrasting needs and wants to each other. The market for beauty products is primarily dominated by females however some males are into these products. It is important for advertisers to realise that as society's social norm changes consumers are more likely to not be defined by past gender roles. Therefore, advertisers should be cautious when using gender as a way to demographically target their target market as a way to communicate with them as they could be excluding a whole other category of possible consumers.

It is used in analysis of urban design and planning. It is akin to but not the same as a Nolli map which denotes public space both within and outside buildings and also akin to a block pattern diagram that records public and private property as simple rectangular blocks. The earliest advocates of its use were Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter.\nAs well as \"fabrics\", a figure ground diagram comprises entities called poch\u00e9s. These are, in simple terms, groups of structures \u2014 or in even simpler terms the black figures on the diagram. A poch\u00e9 helps to define the voids between the buildings, and to emphasize their existence as defined objects in their own rights: spaces that are as much a part of the design as the buildings whose exteriors define them. Frederick Gibberd was a proponent of the reverse figure-ground diagram, where the buildings are in white and the spaces black, to focus the perception of the designer upon the space as an object. This treatment of the space is a predominant factor in figure ground theory, which holds that in urban contexts that mostly comprise vertical structures such as apartment blocks and skyscrapers, the most often neglected feature of the design is the ground plan, which figure-ground studies bring to the fore by emphasizing a two-dimensional representation that structures space.\nThe figure-ground theory of urban design and urban morphology is based upon the use of figure ground studies. It relates the amount of \"figure\" to the amount of \"ground\" in a figure-ground diagram, and approaches urban design as a manipulation of that relationship, as well as being a manipulation of the geometric shapes within the diagram. A figure-ground illustrates a mass-to-void relationship, and analysis of it identifies a \"fabric\" of urban structures. Other related theories of urban design employ different approaches. Linkage theory operates upon linkages between elements of an urban space, and manipulates those. Place theory operates upon structured systems of human needs and usage."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

Many forms of segregation distortion occur in male gamete formation, where there is differential mortality of spermatids during the process of sperm maturation or . The segregation distorter (SD) in \"Drosophila melanogaster\" is the best studied example, and it involves a nuclear envelope protein Ran-GAP and the X-linked repeat array called Responder (Rsp), where the SD allele of Ran-GAP favors its own transmission only in the presence of a Rsp allele on the homologous chromosome. SD acts to kill RSP sperm, in a post-meiotic process (hence it is not strictly speaking meiotic drive). Systems like this can have interesting rock-paper-scissors dynamics, oscillating between the SD-RSP, SD+-RSP and SD+-RSP haplotypes. The SD-RSP haplotype is not seen because it essentially commits suicide.\nWhen segregation distortion acts on sex chromosomes, they can skew the sex ratio. The SR system in \"Drosophila pseudoobscura\", for example, is on the X chromosome, and XSR/Y males produce only daughters, whereas females undergo normal meiosis with Mendelian proportions of gametes. Segregation distortion systems would drive the favored allele to fixation, except that most of the cases where these systems have been identified have the driven allele opposed by some other selective force. One example is the lethality of the t-haplotype in mice, another is the effect on male fertility of the Sex Ratio system in \"D. pseudoobscura\".", "The mouse t-allele is a classic example of a segregation distorter system that has been modeled in great detail. Heterozygotes for a t-haplotype produce 90% of their gametes bearing the t (see Segregation distorters), and homozygotes for a t-haplotype die as embryos.

The phenomenon was subsequently termed the law of associative inhibition. This paved the way for future studies as many psychologists utilised a similar experimental procedure of preparing a series of stimuli for subjects to recognise and/or recall to investigate the effects of interference. \n\nIn 1925, Erwin A. Esper presented subjects with a series of random shapes with different colours. In total there were 4 different shapes and colours, creating 16 possible shape-colour combinations. Each combination was then assigned a nonsensical name which followed the same rule. The first half of the name would be a syllable corresponding to its colour, whilst the second half would be a syllable corresponding to its shape. For example, the colour red would correspond to the syllable \u201cnas\u201d, whilst the first shape would correspond to the syllable \u201clin\u201d, creating the name \u201cnaslin\u201d for that specific combination. By presenting these combinations alongside their names to subjects to remember throughout the length of the study, they were subsequently tested by being asked to recall the name of each randomly presented combination. The results of this study found that in cases where subjects made a mistake, a common pattern emerged. Using the previous colour-shape combination as an example, when it was presented one participant\u2019s response was \u201cnasden\u201d. This response seemed to be an amalgamation of \u201cnaslin\u201d the correct answer, and the word \u201cnasdeg\u201d which interestingly was a name assigned to another colour-shape combination with a different shape, but also in red. This occurrence whereby the stimulus and its similar associate forms a variant were seen for other combinations as well and indicates the presence of associative interference.\n\nAlison M. Dyne and her peers designed a similar experiment, however instead of colours and shapes, word pairs were used to investigate whether overlapping words from different pairs would result in associative interference during recall. Participants were introduced to a study list with word pairs randomly sampled from a word pool which they were subsequently tested on. The pairs that were chosen consisted of a mix of ones which had unique words (where both words did not appear in any other pair on the list), and ones which had overlapping words (where one or both words appeared in other pairs on the list). They were then given one half of the word-pair, and asked to recall and write down the corresponding word for that specific pair.

Like many other experiments in psychology, Milgram's setup involved deception of the participants. In the experiment, subjects were told they were going to take part in a study of the effects of punishment on learning. In reality, the experiment focuses on people's willingness to obey malevolent authority. Each subject served as a teacher of associations between arbitrary pairs of words. After meeting the \"teacher\" at the beginning of the experiment, the \"learner\" (an accomplice of the experimenter) sat in another room and could be heard, but not seen. Teachers were told to give the \"learner\" electric shocks of increasing severity for each wrong answer. If subjects questioned the procedure, the \"researcher\" (again, an accomplice of Milgram) would encourage them to continue. Subjects were told to ignore the agonized screams of the learner, his desire to be untied and stop the experiment, and his pleas that his life was at risk and that he suffered from a heart condition. The experiment, the \"researcher\" insisted, had to go on. The dependent variable in this experiment was the voltage amount of shocks administered.\n\nThe other classical study on obedience was conducted at Stanford University during the 1970s. Phillip Zimbardo was the main psychologist responsible for the experiment. In the Stanford Prison Experiment, college age students were put into a pseudo prison environment in order to study the impacts of \"social forces\" on participants behavior. Unlike the Milgram study in which each participant underwent the same experimental conditions, here using random assignment half the participants were prison guards and the other half were prisoners. The experimental setting was made to physically resemble a prison while simultaneously inducing \"a psychological state of imprisonment\".\n\nThe Milgram study found that most participants would obey orders even when obedience posed severe harm to others. With encouragement from a perceived authority figure, about two-thirds of the participants were willing to administer the highest level of shock to the learner. This result was surprising to Milgram because he thought that \"subjects have learned from childhood that it is a fundamental breach of moral conduct to hurt another person against his will\". Milgram attempted to explain how ordinary people were capable of performing potentially lethal acts against other human beings by suggesting that participants may have entered into an agentic state, where they allowed the authority figure to take responsibility for their own actions.\n\nZimbardo obtained similar results as the guards in the study obeyed orders and turned aggressive.

Data-harvesting software programmed to gather e-mail addresses have become conventional features of the Internet, which among other things results in that spam e-mail messages fill networks and computers with unsolicited commercial content. With those threats in mind, privacy-invasive software may be defined as:"], "wikipedia-50018370": ["Cross-device tracking refers to technology which enables the tracking of users across multiple devices such as smartphones, television sets, smart TVs, and personal computers.\nMore specifically, cross-device tracking is a technique in which technology companies and advertisers deploy trackers, often in the form of unique identifiers, cookies, or even ultrasonic signals, to generate a profile of users across multiple devices, not simply one. For example, one such form of this tracking uses audio beacons, or inaudible sounds, emitted by one device and recognized through the microphone of the other device.\nThis form of tracking is utilized primarily by technology companies and advertisers who use this information to piece together a cohesive profile of the user. These profiles inform and predict the type of advertisements the user receives.\n\nAnother tactic used by Google is called AdID and works on smartphones in tandem with cookies on a user\u2019s computer to track behavior across devices.\n\nNow, cross-device tracking has evolved into a new, radical form of surveillance technology which enables users to be tracked across multiple devices, including smartphones, TVs, and personal computers through the use of audio beacons, or inaudible sound, emitted by one device and recognized through the microphone of the other device, usually a smartphone. In addition, cross-device tracking may presage the future of the Internet of Things (IoT), in which all types of devices\u2013\u2013such as offices, cars, and homes\u2013\u2013are seamlessly interconnected via the internet.\n\nUltrasonic tracking technologies can pose massive threats to users\u2019 privacy. There are four primary privacy concerns associated with this new form of tracking:\nBULLET::::- The first is \"media tracking\": audio from the user\u2019s television may be detected by the microphone in the user\u2019s mobile device, allowing malicious actors to gain access to what the user is watching\u2013\u2013particularly if it is salacious. Advertisers can similarly gain insight into what a user typically watches. In both scenarios, a user\u2019s real-world behavior is linked to their online identity and used for tracking.\nBULLET::::- Another form of tracking permitted by ultrasonic tracking is \"cross-device tracking\", which enables a user\u2019s profile to be connected across multiple devices based on proximity. This form of tracking, in linking different devices, can help advertisers show more targeted ads or open individuals to attacks by malicious actors.\nBULLET::::- \"Location tracking\" is yet another privacy concern. Indeed, ultrasonic signals can convey location information via a location identifier, often placed in stores or businesses.\nBULLET::::- Lastly, this new ultrasonic tracking poses a threat to users of Bitcoin and Tor because it \"deanonymizes\" users\u2019 information, since ultrasonic signals associate the user\u2019s mobile phone with the Bitcoin or Tor account.", "The increased usage of cross-device tracking by advertisers is indicative of the rise of a new era of data extraction and analysis as a form of profit, or surveillance capitalism, a term coined by Shoshana Zuboff. This form of capitalism seeks to commodify private human experience to create behavioral futures markets, in which behavior is predicted and behavioral data is harvested from the user. Zuboff suggests that this new era of surveillance capitalism eclipses Bentham's panopticon, becoming far more encroaching and invasive as, unlike a prison, there is no escape, and the thoughts, feelings, and actions of users are immediately extracted to be commodified and resold. Thus, since cross-device tracking seeks to create a profile of a user across multiple devices, big tech companies, such as Google, could use this behavioral data to make predictions about the user\u2019s future behavior without the user\u2019s awareness.\n\nAdditionally, privacy concerns surround cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons on websites today. Ultimately, five main concerns surround the usage of cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons, according to a study:\nBULLET::::- Firstly, the authors note that users lack \"anonymity\" online, with cookies utilizing unique identifiers and flash cookies enabling recognition of website visits\nBULLET::::- Another concern the authors note is \"unintended uses of cookies,\" since cookies were initially designed to benefit the user\u2019s experience and engagement online, but have since morphed into a business run by advertisers in which personal data is sold for profit\nBULLET::::- Users are likely unaware of how their personal information is being used, reflecting the \"surreptitious nature of data collection\"\nBULLET::::- Some cookies \"trespass into the web users\u2019 own resources\" and are downloaded to the user\u2019s computer often without the user\u2019s awareness\nBULLET::::- Lastly, the authors note that the \"threat of cookie sharing\" underscores how web users\u2019 personal information can become combined with other data from websites and even a social security number to create a more cohesive picture of the user", "In the case of malware, the FTC has placed pressure on companies such as CyberSpy, a self-proclaimed email attachment company that claimed to secretly record users\u2019 key presses. The FTC has also cracked down on companies like Compete, a browser toolbar, because it decrypted users\u2019 personal information on the internet, putting users at risk. Lastly, in cases during which deception is used to engage in surveillance, the FTC has investigated private investigators, who surveil individuals on another person\u2019s behalf. In addition, audio beacon technology, used by an application called Silverpush, could violate the FTC\u2019s policies because users were not made aware as to when the ultrasonic signals were being recorded.\nAnother scholar believes that the convergence between lived experience and online technology is creating a term called Mixed Reality, in which people and things are replaced with virtual experiences. Mixed Reality technologies can pose legal challenges in that laws which govern the online world will also extend to the real world. In addition, data tagging\u2013\u2013often through GPS, location-based services, or even near-field communication (NFC)\u2013\u2013is the new technology at the heart of mixed reality, since people\u2019s data is determined in part by their location. Near-field communication enables devices to transmit data to each other with a certain range. Virtual reality can become a privacy issue because it attempts to immerse users into the virtual environment by recording a user's every sensation. In turn, mixed reality\u2019s amalgamation with daily tasks suggest that it will be implicated in numerous legal issues ranging from copyright law to intellectual property law. Customers are also being denied a voice in contracts, since only corporations set the rules by which individuals\u2019 private information is mined and extracted. The solution to these issues, according to scholars, are opt-in controls to police users\u2019 privacy that enable balance to be restored to the law, particularly as it stands regarding contracts.\nEthically, Zuboff points to the extraction, commodification, and analysis of private human experiences as well as increased surveillance\u2013\u2013which is sometimes hidden\u2013\u2013in everyday life as violating users' rights to privacy. The usage of surreptitious methods, in which the user is unaware of the extent to which he or she is being tracked, brings tracking mechanisms\u2013\u2013such as cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons\u2013\u2013into the ethical realm as well since users are not being informed of this tracking perhaps as often as they should."], "wikipedia-16777474": ["Targeted advertising is a form of online advertising that is directed towards audiences with certain traits, based on the product or person the advertiser is promoting. These traits can either be demographic which are focused on race, economic status, sex, age, the level of education, income level and employment or they can be psychographic focused which are based on the consumer's values, personality, attitudes, opinions, lifestyles and interests. They can also be behavioral variables, such as browser history, purchase history, and other recent activity. Targeted advertising is focused on certain traits and the consumers who are likely to have a strong preference will receive the message instead of those who have no interest and whose preferences do not match a product's attribute. This eliminates wastage.\n\nMost targeted new media advertising currently uses second-order proxies for targetings, such as tracking online or mobile web activities of consumers, associating historical web page consumer demographics with new consumer web page access, using a search word as the basis for implied interest, or contextual advertising.\n\nBy tracking and monitoring what websites users visit, internet service providers can directly show ads that are relative to the consumer's preferences. Most of today's websites are using these targeting technologies to track users' internet behavior and there is much debate over the privacy issues present.\n\nGoogle uses its display network to track what users are looking at and to gather information about them. When a user goes onto a website that uses the google display network it will send a cookie to Google, showing information on the user, what he or she searched, where they are from, found by the IP address, and then builds a profile around them, allowing google to easily target ads to the user more specifically. For example, if a user went onto promotional companies' websites often, that sell promotional pens, Google will gather data from the user such as age, gender, location, and other demographic information as well as information on the websites visited, the user will then be put into a category of promotional products, allowing Google to easily display ads on websites the user visits relating to promotional products. these types of adverts are also called behavioral advertisements as they track the website behavior of the user and displays ads based on previous pages or searched terms.\n\nSocial media targeting is a form of targeted advertising, that uses general targeting attributes such as geotargeting, behavioral targeting, socio-psychographic targeting, and gathers the information that consumers have provided on each social media platform. According to the media users' view history, customers who are interested in the stuff will be automatically targeted by the advertisementa of certain products or service. For example, on Facebook if a consumer has liked clothing pages they will receive ads based on those page likes and the area they have said they live in, this allows advertisers to target very specific consumers as they can specify cities and interests to their needs. Social media also creates profiles of the consumer and only needs to look one place, one the users' profile to find all interests and 'likes'.\n\nAdvertisements can be targeted to specific consumers watching digital cable or over-the-top video. Targeting can be done according to age, gender, location, or personal interests in films, etc. Cable box addresses can be cross-referenced with information from data brokers like Acxiom, Equifax, and Experian, including information about marriage, education, criminal record, and credit history. Political campaigns may also match against public records such as party affiliation and which elections and party primaries the view has voted in.\n\nTargeted advertising based on mobile devices allows more information about the consumer to be transmitted, not just their interests, but their information about their location and time. This allows advertisers to produce advertisements that could cater to their schedule and a more specific changing environment.", "Many online users and advocacy groups are concerned about privacy issues around this type of targeting since targeted advertising requires aggregation of large amounts of personal data, including highly sensitive one (such as sexual orientation or sexual preferences, health issues, location) which is then traded between hundreds of parties in the process of real-time bidding.\nThis is a controversy that the behavioral targeting industry is trying to contain through education, advocacy and product constraints in order to keep all information non-personally identifiable or to obtain permission from end-users. AOL created animated cartoons in 2008 to explain to its users that their past actions may determine the content of ads they see in the future. Canadian academics at the University of Ottawa Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic have recently demanded the federal privacy commissioner to investigate online profiling of Internet users for targeted advertising.\nThe European Commission (via commissioner Meglena Kuneva) has also raised a number of concerns related to online data collection (of personal data), profiling and behavioral targeting, and is looking for \"enforcing existing regulation\".\nIn October 2009 it was reported that a recent survey carried out by University of Pennsylvania and the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology found that a large majority of US internet users rejected the use of behavioral advertising.\nSeveral research efforts by academics and others have demonstrated that data that is supposedly anonymized can be used to identify real individuals.\nIn December 2010, online tracking firm Quantcast agreed to pay $2.4M to settle a class action lawsuit for their use of 'zombie' cookies to track consumers. These zombie cookies, which were on partner sites such as MTV, Hulu, and ESPN, would re-generate to continue tracking the user even if they were deleted. Other uses of such technology include Facebook, and their use of the Facebook Beacon to track users across the internet, to later use for more targeted advertising. Tracking mechanisms without consumer consent are generally frowned upon; however, tracking of consumer behavior online or on mobile devices are key to digital advertising, which is the financial backbone to most of the internet."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This technology has been used successfully to inform usability tests, predict user engagement and intent, detect searcher frustration, and infer user attention to parts of a web page, among other tasks. Unfortunately, because mouse cursor tracking can be performed unobtrusively and at scale, it has opened the door to a brand new wave of massive tracking campaigns and companies that hide behind laudable objectives, such as providing fine-grained, in-page analytics (e.g., hovered and clicked items, scroll reach, speed of browsing) to the website owners.

A health care provider may ask a patient to consent to receive therapy before providing it, or a clinical researcher may ask a research participant before enrolling that person into a clinical trial. Informed consent is collected according to guidelines from the fields of medical ethics and research ethics.\nAn informed consent can be said to have been given based upon a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and consequences of an action. Adequate informed consent is rooted in respecting a person\u2019s dignity. To give informed consent, the individual concerned must have adequate reasoning faculties and be in possession of all relevant facts.", "The doctrine of informed consent relates to professional negligence and establishes a breach of the duty of care owed to the patient (see duty of care, breach of the duty, and respect for persons). The doctrine of informed consent also has significant implications for medical trials of medications, devices, or procedures.\n\nMedicine in the United States, Australia, and Canada also takes this patient-centric approach to \"informed consent.\" Informed consent in these jurisdictions requires healthcare providers to disclose significant risks, as well as risks of particular importance to that patient. This approach combines an objective (a hypothetical reasonable patient) and subjective (this particular patient) approach.\n\nThe doctrine of informed consent should be contrasted with the general doctrine of medical consent, which applies to assault or battery. The consent standard here is only that the person understands, in general terms, the nature of and purpose of the intended intervention. As the higher standard of informed consent applies to negligence, not battery, the other elements of negligence must be made out. Significantly, causation must be shown: That had the individual been made aware of the risk he would not have proceeded with the operation (or perhaps with that surgeon).\n\nOptimal establishment of an informed consent requires adaptation to cultural or other individual factors of the patient. For example, people from Mediterranean and Arab appear to rely more on the context of the delivery of the information, with the information being carried more by who is saying it and where, when, and how it's being said, rather than \"what\" is said, which is of relatively more importance in typical \"Western\" countries.\n\nThe ability to give informed consent is governed by a general requirement of competency. In common law jurisdictions, adults are presumed competent to consent. This presumption can be rebutted, for instance, in circumstances of mental illness or other incompetence. This may be prescribed in legislation or based on a common-law standard of inability to understand the nature of the procedure. In cases of incompetent adults, a health care proxy makes medical decisions. In the absence of a proxy, the medical practitioner is expected to act in the patient's best interests until a proxy can be found.", "Informed consent is part of the ethical clinical research as well, in which a human subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular clinical trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate.

On the other hand, the public interest also requires that the principle of personal autonomy in the context of adult non-violent sexual relationships should be maintained.

After committing participation, the school will take up the project and will be entrusted with the task of motivating its students, explaining the methodology, organising activities under the campaign and undertaking field visits to the nearby forest or natural space.\nAs part of the project work, students will also have an option to find their own forests. During a specified period of 1\u20132 months, the students will form groups and research about the various natural spaces within their city or on the outskirts. This will ensure that a number of natural spaces around one city are explored by different schools, bringing out the biodiversity still existing around urban spaces.\nThe school will then organize trips to these natural spaces, a walk through the city forest, visit to the nearby lake, green patch, sanctuary, or even beach would be the exercise to educate the students about the issues and the related problems. During the course of the visit, which could be for a day, or overnight, the students will gain first-hand information regarding the specific ecosystem and the threats faced by it. Such an outdoor exercise will provide a chance to sensitise the outlook of students and inspire constructive learning and action towards conserving the threatened ecosystems.\nAs a follow-up of the visit, the group of students from each school, will be expected to report on their \u2018own forests\u2019. This information could be developed in several forms - a written report, document, story, pictures, photo stories, amateur videos, one act plays, songs by school bands, petitions to local decision-makers or even \u2018models\u2019 that students could develop citing forests as the lifegivers to their city.This information will be uploaded on the campaign's website, www.citiesforforests.in. This will also be open to individuals, other schools and colleges.\nIn culmination of Phase I, events will be organized in some of the participating cities over a period of one week. Participating schools from each city will collectively present their findings to key decision making audience, for instance presenting a petition to local political leaders, local governments, civil authorities and industries in the region. The aim of this exercise is to exert youth pressure for change and build their democratic competence.\nTo continue engaging with the students and raise awareness about urban forests amongst students of other schools, the participating students can present their findings in special assemblies organized in various schools.

The method is illustrated in \\autoref{fig:noise}: Whenever a \\texttt{\\small{mousemove}} event $e_t$ happens at time $t$, we insert another \\texttt{\\small{mousemove}} event programmatically $e'_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)$ which is within a $\\sigma$ radius away from the original coordinate. This additive Gaussian noise is also applied to the time offsets, to ensure that the distorted trajectory has no duplicated times. The amount of adversarial noise applied to each programmatic event ranges randomly from 0 to $\\sigma$. We ensure that distorted points (both coordinates and time) are always positive values, in line with regular mouse movement data. In this experiment, we study the impact of $\\sigma$ in classification performance. Theoretically, a random classifier should achieve an AUC score of $0.5$ for a two-class classification problem. Therefore, we expect to see a degradation in classification performance with regard to the previous experiments. Given that the BiGRU outperformed the RF model and relies only on raw mouse movements, we only challenge the BiGRU model in these experiments. As observed in \\autoref{tbl:results_with_noise}, using a radius of $\\sigma=0.25$\\,px is enough to degrade the performance of the BiGRU model, which begins to behave as a random classifier (AUC $\\approx 0.5$) of both age and gender. The differences between the original mouse data and the degraded versions are statistically significant at the $p < .001$ level. Hence, this experiment justifies further our proposal to prevent user profiling techniques that exploit mouse cursor movements data. We argue that by using this adversarial noise, a mouse movement trajectory would become ``illegible'' to any machine learning model trying to classify the user's age or gender. This experiment is inline with previous research that reported very small perturbations to cause a significant performance degradation~\\cite{Prakash18_px}. Indeed, by scrambling both spatial and temporal information from a mouse cursor trajectory we are effectively signaling a seemingly arbitrary and jittery movement. To validate further the validity of this adversarial noise, we re-trained our BiGRU model with distorted mouse data, using the same configuration from our previous experiments (\\autoref{sssec:rnn_model}). Now each mouse sequence is distorted according to a random uniform distribution $\\sigma \\sim \\mathcal{U}(0,1)$, which means that some coordinates are preserved ($\\sigma=0$) whereas others are more distorted ($\\sigma=1$). The results are shown in \\autoref{tbl:adversarial-retrain}. As can be observed, the model achieves worse performance than the model trained on the original, non-distorted data, sometimes by a large margin. This was especially so for the age classifier. We conclude that the proposed adversarial noise technique is a robust countermeasure against the neural net used as profiling mechanism via mouse cursor tracking."], "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/11": ["There is a plethora of work that capitalize on user profiling based on how we browse.

Implementation of such a system is simple, as demonstrated by the following:\nBULLET::::- Get previous Session Identifier codice_18 from HTTP request.\nBULLET::::- If codice_18 is null, empty, or no session with SID=codice_18 exists, create a new session.\nBULLET::::- Generate new session identifier codice_21 with a secure random number generator.\nBULLET::::- Let session be identified by SID=codice_21 (and no longer by SID=codice_18)\nBULLET::::- Transmit new SID to client.\nExample:\nIf Mallory successfully tricks Alice into visiting codice_24, this HTTP request is sent to codice_25:\ncodice_25 accepts codice_27, which would normally be bad. However, codice_25 is secure because it performs session regeneration. codice_25 gets the following response:\nAlice will now use codice_30 that is unknown to Mallory, and codice_27 is invalid. Mallory is thus unsuccessful in the session fixation attempt.", "Section::::Countermeasures.:Time-out old SIDs.\nThis defense is simple to implement and has the advantage of providing a measure of protection against unauthorized users accessing an authorized user's account by using a machine that may have been left unattended.\nStore a session variable containing a time stamp of the last access made by that SID. When that SID is used again, compare the current timestamp with the one stored in the session. If the difference is greater than a predefined number, say 5 minutes, destroy the session. Otherwise, update the session variable with the current timestamp.\nSection::::Countermeasures.:Destroy session if Referrer is suspicious.\nWhen visiting a page, most browsers will set the Referrer \u2013 the page that contained the link that you followed to get to this page.\nWhen the user is logged into a site that is not likely to be linked to from outside that site (e.g., banking websites, or webmail), and the site is not the kind of site where users would remain logged in for any great length of time, the Referrer should be from that site. Any other Referrer should be considered suspicious. However, if the originating request is from a HTTPS page, then the referrer will be stripped, so you cannot depend on this security system.\nFor example, codice_8 could employ the following security check:\nif (strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'], 'http://vulnerable.example.com/') !== 0) {\nsession_regenerate_id(); // Generate a new session identifier\nSection::::Countermeasures.:Verify that additional information is consistent throughout session.\nOne way to further improve security is to ensure that the user appears to be the same end user (client). This makes it a bit harder to perform session fixation and other attacks.\nAs more and more networks begin to conform to RFC 3704 and other anti-spoofing practices, the IP address becomes more reliable as a \"same source\" identifier. Therefore, the security of a web site can be improved by verifying that the source IP address is consistent throughout a session.\nThis could be performed in this manner:\nif ($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] != $_SESSION['PREV_REMOTEADDR']) {\nsession_regenerate_id(); // Generate a new session identifier\n$_SESSION['PREV_REMOTEADDR'] = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];\nHowever, there are some points to consider before employing this approach.\nBULLET::::- Several users may share one IP address. It is not uncommon for an entire building to share one IP address using NAT.\nBULLET::::- One user may have an inconsistent IP address. This is true for users behind proxies (such as AOL customers). It is also true for some mobile/roaming users, as well as users that are behind load balanced Internet connections. Users with IPv6 Privacy Extensions enabled may also change their IPv6 privacy addresses at any time.\nBULLET::::- It will not work reliably with dual stack clients as requests will move between IPv4 and IPv6.\nBULLET::::- It will not work reliably with mobile users, as mobile users roam between addresses as well.\nFor some sites, the added security outweighs the lack of convenience, and for others it does not.\nSection::::Countermeasures.:Verify that additional information is consistent throughout session.:User Agent.\nBrowsers identify themselves by \"User-Agent\" HTTP headers. This header does not normally change during use; it would be extremely suspicious if that were to happen. A web application might make use of User-Agent detection in attempt to prevent malicious users from stealing sessions. This however is trivial to bypass, as an attacker can easily capture the victim's user-agent with their own site and then spoof it during the attack. This proposed security system is relying on security through obscurity.\nif ($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] != $_SESSION['PREV_USERAGENT']) {\nsession_regenerate_id(); // Generate a new session identifier\n$_SESSION['PREV_USERAGENT'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];\nHowever, there are some points to consider before employing this approach.\nBULLET::::- Several users may have same browser User Agent in Internet caf\u00e9.\nBULLET::::- Several users may have same default browser (ex: Internet Explorer 6 in Windows XP SP3 or mini browser in mobile phone).\nBut User Agent may change legally in few cases. Following examples are the same users.\nBULLET::::- A smartphone whose screen rotated since the last request\nBULLET::::- Internet Explorer compatibility mode:\nBULLET::::- A user accessing a web site through a proxy distributed across multiple servers, not all of which are upgraded to the latest version of the proxy software\nSection::::Defense in depth.\nDefense in depth is to combine several countermeasures. The idea is simple: if one obstacle is trivial to overcome, several obstacles could be very hard to overcome.\nA defense in depth strategy could involve:\nBULLET::::- Enable HTTPS (to protect against other problems)\nBULLET::::- Correct configuration (do not accept external SIDs, set time-out, etc.)\nBULLET::::- Perform session_regeneration, support log-out, etc.\nHTTP referrers are not passed with SSL/TLS (HTTPS).\nThe following PHP script demonstrates several such countermeasures combined in a defense in depth manner:\nif (isset($_GET['LOGOUT']) ||\nsession_regenerate_id(); // Generate a new session identifier\n$_SESSION['PREV_USERAGENT'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];\n$_SESSION['PREV_REMOTEADDR'] = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];\nNote that this code checks the current REMOTE_ADDR (the user's IP address) and User-agent against the REMOTE_ADDR and User-agent of the previous request.

Therefore, in future work we will release a program that runs at the Operating System level\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool}} and thus can trigger mouse events that are seen as trusted by the web browser."], "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/33": ["Now that we know that it is possible to easily infer user demographics from mouse cursor movements, we propose an adversarial method to modify the user's movements in such a way that the resulting trajectory cannot disclose age and gender information. The method is illustrated in \\autoref{fig:noise}: Whenever a \\texttt{\\small{mousemove}} event $e_t$ happens at time $t$, we insert another \\texttt{\\small{mousemove}} event programmatically $e'_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)$ which is within a $\\sigma$ radius away from the original coordinate. This additive Gaussian noise is also applied to the time offsets, to ensure that the distorted trajectory has no duplicated times. The amount of adversarial noise applied to each programmatic event ranges randomly from 0 to $\\sigma$. We ensure that distorted points (both coordinates and time) are always positive values, in line with regular mouse movement data. In this experiment, we study the impact of $\\sigma$ in classification performance. Theoretically, a random classifier should achieve an AUC score of $0.5$ for a two-class classification problem. Therefore, we expect to see a degradation in classification performance with regard to the previous experiments. Given that the BiGRU outperformed the RF model and relies only on raw mouse movements, we only challenge the BiGRU model in these experiments. As observed in \\autoref{tbl:results_with_noise}, using a radius of $\\sigma=0.25$\\,px is enough to degrade the performance of the BiGRU model, which begins to behave as a random classifier (AUC $\\approx 0.5$) of both age and gender. The differences between the original mouse data and the degraded versions are statistically significant at the $p < .001$ level. Hence, this experiment justifies further our proposal to prevent user profiling techniques that exploit mouse cursor movements data. We argue that by using this adversarial noise, a mouse movement trajectory would become ``illegible'' to any machine learning model trying to classify the user's age or gender. This experiment is inline with previous research that reported very small perturbations to cause a significant performance degradation~\\cite{Prakash18_px}. Indeed, by scrambling both spatial and temporal information from a mouse cursor trajectory we are effectively signaling a seemingly arbitrary and jittery movement. To validate further the validity of this adversarial noise, we re-trained our BiGRU model with distorted mouse data, using the same configuration from our previous experiments (\\autoref{sssec:rnn_model}). Now each mouse sequence is distorted according to a random uniform distribution $\\sigma \\sim \\mathcal{U}(0,1)$, which means that some coordinates are preserved ($\\sigma=0$) whereas others are more distorted ($\\sigma=1$). The results are shown in \\autoref{tbl:adversarial-retrain}. As can be observed, the model achieves worse performance than the model trained on the original, non-distorted data, sometimes by a large margin. This was especially so for the age classifier. We conclude that the proposed adversarial noise technique is a robust countermeasure against the neural net used as profiling mechanism via mouse cursor tracking. We have implemented this adversarial method in a Chrome extension (see `\\nameref{apx:resources}' section) that allows to configure the adversarial noise level (random uniform by default) and the number of \\texttt{\\small{mousemove}} events (one coordinate by default) to be added programmatically. The idea of providing these ``sane defaults'' is to avoid making the mouse movements too distorted so as they can go unnoticed by a machine learner trying to distinguish between human and fake movements."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

It was intended to come in effect on 25 May 2018, but now somewhere in 2019.\nSection::::Difference between regulation and directive.\nThe (new) ePrivacy Regulation will repeal the (current) ePrivacy Directive.\nThe EU Regulation is a legal act of the European Union that becomes immediately enforceable as law in all member states simultaneously.\nThe current EU Directive is a legal act of the European Union that requires member states to achieve a particular result without dictating the means of achieving that result. It can be distinguished from regulations that are self-executing and do not require any implementing measures. The directive leaves member states with a certain amount of leeway as to the exact rules to be adopted.\nSection::::Key points of Commission's proposal.\nAccording to the EU, the proposal for a regulation on high level of privacy rules for all electronic communications includes:\nBULLET::::- New players: Privacy rules will also apply to new players providing electronic communications services such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Skype. That will ensure that the popular services guarantee the same level of confidentiality of communications as traditional telecoms operators.\nBULLET::::- Stronger rules: All people and businesses in the EU will enjoy the same level of protection of their electronic communications through this directly applicable regulation. Businesses will also benefit from one single set of rules across the EU.\nBULLET::::- Communications content and metadata: Privacy is guaranteed for communications like the time and the location of a call. Metadata have a high privacy component and must be anonymised or deleted if users did not give their consent unless the data is needed for billing.\nBULLET::::- New business opportunities: Once consent is given for communications data (content and/or metadata) to be processed, traditional telecoms operators will have more opportunities to provide additional services and to develop their businesses. For example, they could produce heat maps indicating the presence of individuals, which could help public authorities and transport companies when developing new infrastructure projects.\nBULLET::::- Simpler rules on cookies: The cookie provision, which has resulted in an overload of consent requests for internet users, will be streamlined. The new rule will be more user-friendly, as browser settings will provide for an easy way to accept or refuse tracking cookies and other identifiers. The proposal also clarifies that no consent is needed for non-privacy-intrusive cookies improving internet experience (like to remember shopping cart history) or cookies used by a website to count the number of visitors.\nBULLET::::- Protection against spam: The proposal bans unsolicited electronic communications by emails, SMS, and automated calling machines. Depending on national law, people will either be protected by default or be able to use a do-not-call list to avoid receiving marketing phone calls. Marketing callers will need to display their phone number or use a special pre-fix that indicates a marketing call.\nBULLET::::- More effective enforcement: The enforcement of the confidentiality rules in the regulation will be the responsibility of data protection authorities, already in charge of the rules under the General Data Protection Regulation.\nSection::::Digital Single Market.\nThe EU Digital Single Market strategy aims to open up digital opportunities for people and business and enhance Europe's position as a world leader in the digital economy.\nAs part of the strategy, the General Data Protection Regulation and the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems will apply from 25 May 2018. The proposed ePrivacy Regulation was also planned to be applicable from 25 May 2018, but it is currently not expected to take effect until 2019. The eIDAS Regulation is also part of the strategy."], "wikipedia-45149704": ["AdChoices is a self-regulatory program for online interest-based advertising that exists in the United States, Canada and across Europe. The program calls for advertising companies to establish and enforce responsible privacy practices for interest-based advertising, aimed to give consumers enhanced transparency and control. Companies adhere to a set of principles that are enforced by accountability programs.\n\"Interest-based advertising\" (also known as \"online behavioural advertising\" or \"behavioral targeting\") selectively displays ads based on browsing history, primarily using cookies, to users most likely to identify with and respond to the ad's specific content. The AdChoices icon is shown automatically by companies part of the self-regulatory program, and is meant to indicate to consumers when interest-based advertising data is being collected or used. By clicking on the icon (which is usually found in the top right corner of an online advertisement), a consumer can learn more about the ad or a website's collection practices, and be provided with the ability to opt-out of such targeting.\nAlthough it is possible to opt out of interest-based advertising through the AdChoices program(s), opting out does not block advertisements nor prevent tracking of web browsing history by use of other ways (e.g. Flash cookies). The US and Canadian AdChoices programs require that participating companies not use Flash cookies or similar locally shared objects for online interest-based advertising purposes."], "wikipedia-164103": ["The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became enforceable on 25 May 2018..

Other countries are also following the same route, yet currently online advertising is ubiquitous. Also, it remains the dominant monetization model on the Web, with constantly increasing growth rates and revenues. This has promoted advancements in user tracking and profiling technologies that allow to serve more relevant ad content to the user, and at a higher premium, known as targeted ads or Online Behavioral Advertising~\\cite{Beals_2010, Carrascosa_2015}. Web tracking and user profiling rely on mechanisms to uniquely identify and track the user's online behavior over time, including e.g., geolocation, visited pages, search keywords, and social network activity. All of these in order to better understand the user intentions and interests. However, a less known method to profile the user is by means of mouse cursor tracking. This technology has been used successfully to inform usability tests~\\cite{Atterer:2006:KUM:1135777.1135811}, predict user engagement~\\cite{Arapakis:2014:UWE:2661829.2661909} and intent~\\cite{Guo:2008:EMM:1390334.1390462, MARTINALBO2016989}, detect searcher frustration~\\cite{Feild:2010:PSF:1835449.1835458}, and infer user attention to parts of a web page~\\cite{Arapakis:2016:PUE:2911451.2911505}, among other tasks. Unfortunately, because mouse cursor tracking can be performed unobtrusively~\\cite{LEIVA2015114} and at scale~\\cite{Huang:2011:NCN:1978942.1979125}, it has opened the door to a brand new wave of massive tracking campaigns and companies that hide behind laudable objectives, such as providing fine-grained, in-page analytics (e.g., hovered and clicked items, scroll reach, speed of browsing) to the website owners. Interestingly, by tracking the mouse cursor it is possible to profile the user demographics, namely predicting age~\\cite{Takashi2015, Yamauchi2014} and gender~\\cite{Kratky:2016, Pentel2017}, a piece of valuable personal data that most users are unaware of~\\cite{Carrascal13_pii}."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-38104075": 1, "wikipedia-10927720": 1, "wikipedia-45149704": 1, "wikipedia-26068326": 1, "wikipedia-20478586": 1, "wikipedia-1052571": 1, "wikipedia-218879": 1, "wikipedia-334756": 1, "wikipedia-3421940": 1, "wikipedia-1446965": 1, "arxiv-2503.05764": 1, "arxiv-2008.13404": 1, "arxiv-2104.06861": 1, "arxiv-1911.09964": 1, "arxiv-2105.06942": 1, "arxiv-2104.00648": 1, "arxiv-2210.09269": 1, "arxiv-2110.02597": 1, "arxiv-2306.07463": 1, "arxiv-2103.07297": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/39": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/28": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/33": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/30": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/22": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/36": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-38104075": 2, "wikipedia-10927720": 2, "wikipedia-45149704": 2, "wikipedia-26068326": 1, "wikipedia-20478586": 1, "wikipedia-1052571": 1, "wikipedia-218879": 1, "wikipedia-334756": 1, "wikipedia-3421940": 2, "wikipedia-1446965": 1, "arxiv-2503.05764": 1, "arxiv-2008.13404": 1, "arxiv-2104.06861": 1, "arxiv-1911.09964": 1, "arxiv-2105.06942": 1, "arxiv-2104.00648": 1, "arxiv-2210.09269": 1, "arxiv-2110.02597": 1, "arxiv-2306.07463": 1, "arxiv-2103.07297": 2, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/9": 2, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/39": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/28": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/33": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/30": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/22": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/36": 1}}}

We do not argue, however, that mouse tracking should be removed from any website, as it may be a valuable data source for various application scenarios. Rather, we find it disconcerting that currently there is no way for end-users to opt-out easily. The work presented here serves a dual purpose. First, it aims at raising awareness on the emerging privacy threats in the online world and exposes some of the unaccounted ---yet sizeable risks--- of tracking technologies. Even when dealing with a seemingly harmless browser activity logging practice, such as the collection of mouse cursor coordinates, a third party can mine this data to uncover personally identifiable information about the users."], "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/17": ["Websites can infer fine-grained information about the users by tracking their mouse cursor activity.

However, the research literature on mouse cursor tracking has pointed out far more advanced and creative use cases for this technology. The above studies demonstrate that certain cognitive and motor control mechanisms are embodied and reflected, to some extent, in our mouse cursor movements and online interactions.

While some advertisers do care about organizing users into general groups, others aim at creating detailed individual profiles, which should not happen without explicit user's consent."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-32800626": 1, "wikipedia-14016456": 1, "wikipedia-15036": 1, "wikipedia-11241476": 1, "wikipedia-12146628": 1, "wikipedia-382082": 1, "wikipedia-10198528": 1, "wikipedia-20333171": 1, "wikipedia-60583225": 1, "wikipedia-35334535": 1, "arxiv-1807.05746": 1, "arxiv-2311.02630": 1, "arxiv-2310.04970": 2, "arxiv-2105.13347": 1, "arxiv-2107.11029": 1, "arxiv-2310.01685": 1, "arxiv-2405.14457": 1, "arxiv-2309.05889": 1, "arxiv-2411.09523": 1, "arxiv-2302.09258": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/9": 3, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/34": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/0": 3, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/35": 3, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/10": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/36": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/19": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/11": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/21": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-32800626": 1, "wikipedia-14016456": 1, "wikipedia-15036": 1, "wikipedia-11241476": 1, "wikipedia-12146628": 1, "wikipedia-382082": 1, "wikipedia-10198528": 1, "wikipedia-20333171": 1, "wikipedia-60583225": 1, "wikipedia-35334535": 1, "arxiv-1807.05746": 1, "arxiv-2311.02630": 2, "arxiv-2310.04970": 3, "arxiv-2105.13347": 1, "arxiv-2107.11029": 1, "arxiv-2310.01685": 1, "arxiv-2405.14457": 1, "arxiv-2309.05889": 1, "arxiv-2411.09523": 1, "arxiv-2302.09258": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/9": 3, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/34": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/0": 3, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/35": 3, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/10": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/36": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/19": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/11": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/21": 1}}}

While the query is broad, Wikipedia pages discussing these topics could help partially address it.", "wikipedia-31602166": ["Social network security and privacy issues result from the astronomical amounts of information these sites process each day. Features that invite users to participate in\u2014messages, invitations, photos, open platform applications and other applications are often the venues for others to gain access to a user's private information. In addition, the technologies needed to deal with user's information may intrude their privacy. More specifically, In the case of Facebook. Unfortunately, the flaws render the system to be almost indefensible. \"The question for social networks is resolving the difference between mistakes in implementation and what the design of the application platform is intended to allow\", said David Evans, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. Moreover, there is also the question of who should be held responsible for the lack of user privacy? According to Evan, the answer to the question is not likely to be found, because a better regulated API would be required for Facebook \"to break a lot of applications, [especially when] a lot of companies are trying to make money off [these] applications\". Felt agrees with her conclusion, because \"there are marketing businesses built on top of the idea that third parties can get access to data and user information on Facebook\".\n\nThe advent of the Web 2.0 has caused social profiling and is a growing concern for internet privacy. Web 2.0 is the system that facilitates participatory information sharing and collaboration on the Internet, in social networking media websites like Facebook and MySpace. These social networking sites have seen a boom in their popularity beginning in the late 2000s. Through these websites many people are giving their personal information out on the internet.\n\nThese social networks keep track of all interactions used on their sites and save them for later use. Issues include cyberstalking, location disclosure, social profiling, 3rd party personal information disclosure, and government use of social network websites in investigations without the safeguard of a search warrant.", "There are several ways for third parties to access user information. Flickr is an example of a social media website that provides geotagged photos that allows users to view the exact location of where a person is visiting or staying. Geotagged photos make it easy for third party users to see where an individual is located or traveling to. There is also growing use of phishing, which reveals sensitive information through secretive links and downloads through email, messages, and other communications. Social media has opened up an entirely new realm for hackers to get information from normal posts and messages.\n\nNearly all of the most popular applications on Facebook\u2014including Farmville, Causes, and Quiz Planet\u2014have been sharing users' information with advertising and tracking companies. \n\nEven though Facebook's privacy policy says they can provide \"any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected\" to advertisers, they violate this policy. If a user clicked a specific ad in a page, Facebook will send the address of this page to advertisers, which will directly lead to a profile page. In this case, it is easy to identify users' names. For example, Take With Me Learning is an app that allows teachers and students to keep track of their academic process. The app requires personal information that includes, school name, user's name, email, and age. But Take With Me Learning was created by company that was known for illegally gathering student's personal information without their knowledge and selling it to advertisement companies. This company had violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), used to keep children safe from identity theft while using the internet. Most recently, Facebook has been scrutinized for the collection of users' data by Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica was collecting data from Facebook users\u2019 after they agreed to take a psychology questionnaire. Not only could Cambridge Analytica access the data of the person who took the survey, they could also access all of the data of that person's Facebook friends. This data was then used to hopefully sway people's\u2019 beliefs in hopes that they would vote for a certain politician. While what Cambridge Analytica did by collecting the data may or may not be illegal, they then transferred the data they acquired to third parties so that it could be used to sway voters.\n\nOn most social media websites, user's geographical location can be gathered either by users (through voluntary check-in applications like Foursquare and Facebook Places) or by applications (through technologies like IP address geolocation, cellphone network triangulation, RFID and GPS). The approach used matters less than the result which holds that the content produced is coupled with the geographical location where the user produced it. Additionally, many applications attach the contents of other forms of information like OS language, device type and capture time. The result is that by posting, tweeting or taking pictures, users produce and share an enormous amount of personal information.", "companies are waiting in line to get access to millions of tweets from users that are using the popular social networking website. Companies believe that by using data mining technologies they would be able to gather important information that can be used for marketing and advertising.\nAccording to Gary Kovacs's speech about Tracking our online trackers, when he used the internet to find an answer to a question, \"We are not even 2 bites into breakfast and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me\", and he was navigated by 4 of them.\nStudies have also pointed to most social networks unintentionally providing 3rd party advertising and tracking sites with personal information. It raises the issue of private information inadvertently being sent to 3rd party advertising sites via Referrer strings or cookies.\nCivil libertarians worry that social networking sites, particularly Facebook, have greatly diminished user confidentiality in numerous ways. For one thing, when social media platforms store private data, they also have complete access to that material as well. To sustain their profitability, applications like Facebook examine and market personal information by logging data through cookies, small files that stockpile the data on someone's device. Companies, such as Facebook, carry extensive amounts of private user information on file, regarding individuals\u2019, \"likes, dislikes, and preferences\", which are of high value to marketers. As Facebook reveals user information to advertising and marketing organizations, personalized endorsements will appear on news feeds based on \"surfing behavior, hobbies, or pop culture preferences\".\nA 2011 study highlighted these issues by measuring the amount of unintended information leakage over a large number of users with the varying number of social networks. It identified and measured information that could be used in attacks against what-you-know security.\nTwitter has admitted that they have scanned and imported their user's phone contacts onto the website database so that they can learn more about their users. Most users were unaware that Twitter is created this way for new users to search for their friends.\nIn 2015, after Facebook bought Instagram there was an option that Instagram could use its own users photos for ad purposes. This new policy was hidden in their user agreement.\nAs there is so much information provided other things can be deduced, such as the person's social security number, which can then be used as part of identity theft. In 2009, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University published a study showing that it is possible to predict most and sometimes all of an individual's 9-digit Social Security number using information gleaned from social networks and online databases. Cases have also appeared of users having photographs stolen from social networking sites in order to assist in identity theft. There is little evidence that users of social networking sites are taking full measures to protect themselves from identity theft.", "Most major social networking sites are committed to ensuring that use of their services are as safe as possible. However, due to the high content of personal information placed on social networking sites, as well as the ability to hide behind a pseudo-identity, such sites have become increasingly popular for sexual prostetuited [online]. Further, lack of age verification mechanisms is a cause of concern in these social networking platforms. However, it was also suggested that the majority of these simply transferred to using the services provided by Facebook. While the numbers may remain small, it has been noted that the number of sexual prostetuites caught using social networking sites has been increasing, and has now reached an almost weekly basis. In worst cases children have become victims of pedophiles or lured to meet strangers.They say that sexual predators can lurk anonymously through the wormholes of cyberspace and access victim profiles online. A number of highly publicized cases have demonstrated the threat posed for users, such as Peter Chapman who, under a false name, added over 3,000 friends and went on to rape and murder a 17-year-old girl in 2009. In another case, a 12-year-old, Evergreen girl was safely found by the FBI with the help of Facebook, due to her mother learning of her daughter's conversation with a man she had met on the popular social networking application.\n\nThe potential ability for stalking user...", "Social networks are designed for individuals to socially interact with other people over the Internet. However, some individuals engage in undesirable online social behaviors, which negatively impacts other people's online experiences. It has created a wide range of online interpersonal victimization. Some studies have shown that social network victimization appears largely in adolescent and teens, and the type of victimization includes sexual advances and harassment. Recent research has reported approximately 9% of online victimization involves social network activities. It has been noted that many of these victims are girls who have been sexually victimized over these social network sites. Research concludes that many of social network victimizations are associated with user behaviors and interaction with one another. Negative social behaviors such as aggressive attitudes and discussing sexual related topics motivate the offenders to achieve their goals. All in all, positive online social behaviors is promoted to help reduce and avoid online victimization.\n\nWhile the concept of a worldwide communicative network seems to adhere to the public sphere model, market forces control access to such a resource. In 2010, investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that many of the most popular applications on Facebook were transmitting identifying information about users and their friends to advertisers and internet tracking companies, which is a violation of Facebook's privacy policy. The Wall Street Journal analyzed the ten most popular Facebook apps, including Zynga's FarmVille with 57 million users, and Zynga's Mafia Wars with 21.9 million users, and found that they were transmitting Facebook user IDs to data aggregators. Every online move leaves cyber footprints that are rapidly becoming fodder for research without people ever realizing it. Using social media for academic research is accelerating and raising ethical concerns along the way, as vast amounts of information collected by private companies \u2014 including Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter \u2014 are giving new insight into all aspects of everyday life. Our social media \"audience\" is bigger than we actually know; our followers or friends aren't the only ones that can see information about us. Social media sites are collecting data from us just by searching something such as \"favorite restaurant\" on our search engine. Facebook is transformed from a public space to a behavioral laboratory,\" says the study, which cites a Harvard-based research project of 1,700 college-based Facebook users in which it became possible to \"deanonymize parts of the data set,\" or cross-reference anonymous data to make student identification possible. Some of Facebook's research on user behavior found that 71% of people drafted at least one post that they never posted. Another analyzed 400,000 posts and found that children's communication with parents decreases in frequency from age 13 but then rises when they move out.\n\nThe FBI has dedicated undercover agents on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn. One example of investigators using Facebook to nab a criminal is the case of Maxi Sopo. Charged with bank fraud, and having escaped to Mexico, he was nowhere to be found until he started posting on Facebook. Although his profile was private, his list of friends was not, and through this vector, where he met a former official of the Justice Department, he was eventually caught .\n\nIn recent years, some state and local law enforcement agencies have also begun to rely on social media websites as resources. Although obtaining records of information not shared publicly by or about site users often requires a subpoena, public pages on sites such as Facebook and MySpace offer access to personal information that can be valuable to law enforcement. Police departments have reported using social media websites to assist in investigations, locate and track suspects, and monitor gang activity.\n\nFoursquare, Facebook, Loopt are application which allow users to check- in and these capabilities allows a user to share their current location information to their connection. Some of them even update their travel plans on social networking applications.However, the disclosure of location information within these networks can cause privacy concerns among mobile users. Foursquare defines another framework of action for the user. It appears to be in the interest of Foursquare that users provide many personal data that are set as public. This is illustrated, among others, by the fact that, although all the respondents want high control over the (location) privacy settings, almost none of them ever checked the Foursquare privacy settings before. Although there are algorithms using encryption, k-anonymity and noise injection algorithms, its better to understand how the location sharing works in these applications to see if they have good algorithms in place to protect location privacy.", "Controversially, these Terms of Use declarations that users must agree to often contain clauses permitting social networking operators to store data on users, or even share it with third parties. Facebook has attracted attention over its policies regarding data storage, such as making it difficult to delete an account, holding onto data after an account is de-activated and being caught sharing personal data with third parties.\n\nAmong other factors, it has been observed that data loss is correlated positively with risky online behavior and forgoing the necessary antivirus and anti spyware programs to defend against breaches of private information via the internet.\n\nAlways log out. It is dangerous to keep your device logged on since others may have access to your social profiles while you are not paying attention. Keep your full name and address to yourself. Children's safety may be compromised if their parents post their whereabouts in a site where others know who their real identities are.\n\nMake sure the social networking site is safe before sharing information. Users shouldn't be sharing information if they don't know who are using the websites since their personally identifiable information could be exposed to other users of the site.\n\nInstall Anti-virus software. Others would be able to use viruses and other ways to invade a user's computer if he or she installed something unsafe.\n\n(1) Adding a new friend. Facebook reports 8.7% of its total profiles are fake. A user should be sure about who the person is before adding it as a new friend.\n(2) Clicking on links. Many links which looks attractive like gift cards are specially designed by malicious users. Clicking on these links may result in losing personal information or money.\n(3) Think twice about posting revealing photos. A revealing photo could attract the attention of potential criminals.", "Additionally, Facebook has been under fire for keeping track of one's Internet usage whether users are logged into the social media site or not. A user may notice personalized ads under the 'Sponsored' area of the page. \"The company uses cookies to log data such as the date, time, URL, and your IP address whenever you visit a site that has a Facebook plug-in, such as a 'Like' button.\" Facebook claims this data is used to help improve one's experience on the website and to protect against 'malicious' activity. Another issue of privacy that Facebook uses is the new facial recognition software. This feature includes the software to identify photos that users are tagged in by developing a template based on one's facial features. Recently, there have been allegations made against Facebook accusing the app of listening in on its users through their smartphone's microphone in order to gather information for advertisers. These rumors have been proven to be false as well as impossible. For one, because it does not have a specific buzzword to listen for like the Amazon Echo, Facebook would have to record everything its users say. This kind of \u201cconstant audio surveillance would produce about 33 times more data daily than Facebook currently consumes\u201d. Additionally, it would become immediately apparent to the user as their phone's battery life would be swiftly drained by the amount of power it would take to record every conversation. Finally, it is clear that Facebook doesn't need to listen in on its users\u2019 conversations because it already has plenty of access to their data and internet search history through cookies. Facebook specifically states in their Cookies Policy that they use cookies to help display ads that will peak the users interest. They then use this information to help make recommendations for numerous businesses, organizations, associations, etc. to individuals who may be interested in the products, services or causes they offer. A leaked document from Facebook has revealed that the company was able to identify \"insecure, worthless, stressed or defeated\" emotions, especially in teenagers, and then proceeded to inform advertisers. While similar issues have arisen in the past, this continues to make individuals\u2019 emotional states seem more like a commodity. They are able to target certain age groups depending on the time that their advertisements appear. Instagram tracks users' photos even if they do not post them using a geotag. The app geotags an uploaded image regardless of whether the user chose to share its location or not. Therefore, anybody can view the exact location where an image was uploaded on a map. This is concerning due to the fact that most people upload photos from their home or other locations they frequent a lot, and the fact that locations are so easily shared raises privacy concerns of stalking and sexual predators being able to find their target in person after discovering them online. The new Search function on Instagram combines the search of places, people, and tags to look at nearly any location on earth, allowing them to scout out a vacation spot, look inside a restaurant, and even to experience an event like they were there in person. The privacy implications of this fact is that people and companies can now see into every corner of the world, culture, and people's private lives. Additionally, this is concerning for individual privacy, because when someone searches through these features on Instagram for a specific location or place, Instagram shows them the personal photos that their users have posted, along with the likes and comments on that photo regardless of whether the poster's account is private or not. With these features, completely random people, businesses, and governments can see aspects of Instagram users' private lives.", "feature, their location is shared as the specific intersection that they are at, and this location in current time can be viewed simply by tapping their profile image. This is concerning because Swarm users may believe they are being discreet by sharing only which neighborhood they are in, while in fact they are sharing the exact pinpoint of their location. The privacy implications of this is that people are inadvertently sharing their exact location when they do not know that they are. This plays into the privacy concerns of social media in general, because it makes it easier for other users as well as the companies this location data is shared with to track Swarm members. This tracking makes it easier for people to find their next targets for identity theft, stalking, and sexual harassment.\n\nSpokeo is a \"people-related\" search engine with results compiled through data aggregation. The site contains information such as age, relationship status, estimated personal wealth, immediate family members and home address of individual people. This information is compiled through what is already on the internet or in other public records, but the website does not guarantee accuracy.\n\nDespite Twitter's best efforts to protect their users privacy, personal information can still be dangerous to share. There have been incidents of leaked tweets on Twitter. Leaked tweets are tweets that have been published from a private account but have been made public. This occurs when friends of someone with a private account retweet, or copy and paste, that person's tweet and so on and so forth until the tweet is made public. This can make private information public, and could possibly be dangerous.\n\nAnother issue involving privacy on Twitter deals with users unknowingly disclosing their information through tweets. Twitter has location services attached to tweets, which some users don't even know are enabled. Many users tweet about being at home and attach their location to their tweet, revealing their personal home address. This information is represented as a latitude and longitude, which is completely open for any website or application to access. WeKnowYourHouse is an example of a website that has taken this information and posted it online for anyone to see. They provide Twitter user's names and personal addresses. The owner of the site stated that he created it as a warning to show how easy it is to find and reveal personal information without the right precautions. People also tweet about going on vacation and giving the times and places of where they are going and how long they will be gone for. This has led to numerous break ins and robberies. Twitter users can avoid location services by disabling them in their privacy settings.\n\nCertain social media sites such as Ask.fm, Whisper, and Yik Yak allow users to interact anonymously. The problem with websites such as these is that \u201cdespite safeguards that allow users to report abuse, people on the site believe they can say almost anything without fear or consequences\u2014and they do.\" This is a privacy concern because users can say whatever they choose and the receiver of the message may never know who they are communicating with. Sites such as these allow for a large chance or cyberbullying or cyberstalking to occur. People seem to believe that since they can be anonymous, they have the freedom to say anything no matter how mean or malicious.", "This feature however has raised privacy concerns because \u201c\u2018It is very easy to accidentally share everything that you've got with more people than you need too, and that's the scariest portion,\u2019 cyber security expert Charles Tendell told ABC News of the Snapchat update.\u201d For protecting younger users of Snapchat, \u201cExperts recommend that parents stay aware of updates to apps like Snapchat. They also suggest parents make sure they know who their kids' friends are on Snapchat and also talk to their children about who they add on Snapchat.\u201d\nThis new product has received negative feedback because the Spectacles do not stand out from normal sunglasses beyond the small cameras on the lenses. Therefore, users have the ability to record strangers without them knowing. and could potentially otherwise unwilling of the glasses may not even realize they are any different than a basic pair of shades. Critics of Snapchat Spectacles argue that this product is an invasion of privacy for the people who do not know they are being recorded by individuals who are wearing the glasses.\nThe report assessed Snapchat's use of encryption and found that it ranks poorly in how it uses encryption to protect users\u2019 security as a result of not using end-to-end encryption. Because of this, third parties have the ability to access Snapchats while they are being transferred from one device to another. The report also claimed that Snapchat does not explicitly inform users in its privacy policy of the application's level of encryption or any threats the application may pose to users\u2019 rights, which further reduced its overall score.\nThe FTC also claimed that Snapchat took information from its users such as location and contact information without their consent. Despite not being written in their privacy policy, Snapchat transmitted location information from mobile devices to its analytics tracking service provider. Although \"Snapchat's privacy policy claimed that the app collected only your email, phone number, and Facebook ID to find friends for you to connect with, if you're an IOS user and entered your phone number to find friends, Snapchat collected the names and phone numbers of all the contacts in your mobile device address books without your notice or consent.\""], "wikipedia-19336369": ["A web threat is any threat that uses the World Wide Web to facilitate cybercrime. Web threats use multiple types of malware and fraud, all of which utilize HTTP or HTTPS protocols, but may also employ other protocols and components, such as links in email or IM, or malware attachments or on servers that access the Web. They benefit cybercriminals by stealing information for subsequent sale and help absorb infected PCs into botnets. Web threats pose a broad range of risks, including financial damages, identity theft, loss of confidential information/data, theft of network resources, damaged brand/personal reputation, and erosion of consumer confidence in e-commerce and online banking.\n\nPush-based threats use spam, phishing, or other fraudulent means to lure a user to a malicious (often spoofed) website which then collects information and/or injects malware. Push attacks use phishing, DNS poisoning (or pharming), and other means to appear to originate from a trusted source. Precisely-targeted push-based web threats are often referred to as spear phishing to reflect the focus of their data gathering attack. Spear phishing typically targets specific individuals and groups for financial gain. In other push-based web threats, malware authors use social engineering such as enticing subject lines that reference holidays, popular personalities, sports, pornography, world events and other hot topics to persuade recipients to open the email and follow links to malicious websites or open attachments with malware that accesses the Web.\n\nPull-based web threats are often referred to as \u201cdrive-by\u201d threats by experts (and more commonly as \u201cdrive-by downloads\u201d by journalists and the general public), since they can affect any website visitor. Cybercriminals infect legitimate websites, which unknowingly transmit malware to visitors or alter search results to take users to malicious websites. Upon loading the page, the user\u2019s browser passively runs a malware downloader in a hidden HTML frame (IFRAME) without any user interaction.\n\nIn September 2017, visitors to TV network Showtime's website found that the website included Coinhive code that automatically began mining for Monero cryptocurrency without user consent. The Coinhive software was throttled to use only twenty percent of a visiting computer's CPU to avoid detection. Shortly after this discovery was publicized on social media, the Coinhive code was removed. Showtime declined to comment for multiple news articles. It's unknown if Showtime inserted this code into its website intentionally or if the addition of cryptomining code was the result of a website compromise. Coinhive offers code for websites that requires user consent prior to execution, but less than 2 percent of Coinhive implementations use this code. German researchers have defined cryptojacking as websites executing cryptomining on visiting users' computers without prior consent. With 1 out of every five hundred websites hosting a cryptomining script, cryptojacking is a persistent web threat."], "wikipedia-58437070": ["Issues of privacy emerge within this sphere of participatory surveillance, predominantly focused on how much information is available on the web that an individual does not consent to. As digital technology advances with many dangers associated to privacy, individuals are attempting to be more accountable when meeting others. Background check websites and search engine sources reveal just how many people attempt to find information on another person, whatever the reason. Many researchers altogether ignore the idea of privacy when analyzing methods of participatory surveillance. More so, from a social media perspective, some researchers claim that by openly sharing information with others, this cannot be deemed a breach of privacy. However, a few researchers on the topic mention breaches of privacy within the spheres of both digital media studies and infodemiology.", "Doxing is a form of cyberbullying, using the Internet to post private information about an individual or organization as a means of attack against the entity. Common information that can be leaked can be anything from a past discretion, home address, or even social security number of the victim. This information could be freely available on the Internet for the attacker to gain access to and make public. This differentiates it from other types of information leaks, since the information is simply being brought to the forefront of the public's viewing. In other words, the public information being leaked could be found freely by other parties even if it was not exposed in a more public light. The term \"doxing\" comes from the origins of document, first used in 2001 with the infamous hacker collective called Anonymous. With today's current laws, most legislation pertaining to cyber threats and attacks are rooted in the 1990s, when the Internet was just developing. Due to information being stored online, doxing does not adhere to standard rights of privacy. Constitutionally, individuals should have the right to disclose or not disclose information, while at the same time being able to make decisions about privacy. The Fourth Amendment protects the right to free speech, but doxing uniquely uses information available to the public, leading some 'doxers' to claim that they are simply exercising their Fourth Amendment rights. The only exception to Fourth Amendment rights came about from \"Cohen v. California,\" which established the \"true threat\" exception. This exception established a breach of free speech rights whenever the content of the speech maliciously invades privacy interests. However, this exception may only work in some doxing situations, where the court measures the extent of the offense and the reactions from the attack."], "wikipedia-31265421": ["We are told our data is exposed and that we lack complete privacy. While our data is exposed through digital mediums, such as social media, we also more sensitized to privacy issues.\nThe evolution between 2005 and 2011 of the level of disclosure for different profile items on Facebook shows that over the years, people want to keep more information private. Social networks have done the opposite: if we share more information, we expose more and Facebook can sell more to advertisers. Every 8 or 10 months, some social networks face privacy incidents which lead users to regroup and contest, however the networks usually apologize and continue on with the same information-mining tactics.\nWhen we share information with friends, their data are exposed and privacy decreases. This is a consequence of bridging social capital: as we create new and diverse ties on social networks, data becomes linked. This decrease of privacy continues until bundling appears (when the ties become strong and the network more homogenous). Privacy then increases through stagnation, creating a community where privacy can be reattained through mass. However, Facebook and other social media outlets find other ways for us to share information, for instance through games, top 10, quizz, etc. It makes what we can call \"cycles of privacy\".\nIn the context of digital privacy, communication privacy is the notion that individuals should have the freedom, or right, to communicate information digitally with the expectation that their communications are secure; meaning that messages and communications will only be accessible to the sender's original intended recipient. However, communications can be intercepted or delivered to other recipients without the sender's knowledge, in a multitude of ways. Communications can be intercepted directly through various hacking methods, this is expanded upon further below. Communications can also be delivered to recipients unbeknownst to the sender due to false assumptions made regarding the platform or medium which was used to send information.\nAn example of a digital breach of individual privacy would be an internet user receiving unwanted ads and emails/spam, or a computer virus that forces the user to take actions they otherwise wouldn't. In such cases the individual, during that moment, doesn't exist digitally without interruption from unwanted information; thus their individual privacy has been infringed upon.\nSome internet users proactively work to ensure that their information can not be collected, this is the practice of attempting to remain anonymous.\nMethods can be purposely crafted to obtain one's personal information illegally. These directed attacks are commonly referred to as hacking, though that term refers to the general practice and doesn't address specific hacking methods and implementation.", "Phishing is a common method of obtaining someone's private information. This generally consists of an individual (often referred in this context as a hacker), developing a website that looks similar to other major websites that a target person commonly uses. The phishing website may look identical to the legitimate site, but its URL could be a variation in spelling or a different domain such as .org instead of .com. The target person can be directed to the site through a link in a 'fake' email that is designed to look like it came from the website he/she commonly uses. The user then clicks on the URL, proceeds to sign in, or provide other personal information, and as opposed to the information being submitted to the website that the user thought they were on, it is actually sent directly to the hacker. Phishing attacks commonly obtain bank and financial data as well as social networking website information. There are tools that can help users protect their information from phishing attacks and these include the Web browser extensions, which are capable of flagging suspicious websites and links. Digital privacy is a trending social concern. For example, the TED talk by Eric Berlow and Sean Gourley subsequent to the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures cast a shadow over the privacy of cloud storage and social media. While digital privacy is concerned with the privacy of digital information in general, in many contexts it specifically refers to information concerning personal identity shared over public networks. Before the Edward Snowden disclosures concerning the extent of the NSA PRISM program were revealed in 2013, the public debate on digital privacy mainly centered on privacy concerns with social networking services, as viewed from within these services. As the secrecy of the American Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act becomes widely disclosed, digital privacy is increasingly recognized as an issue in the context of mass surveillance. The use of cryptographic software to evade prosecution and harassment while sending and receiving information over computer networks is associated with crypto-anarchism, a movement intending to protect individuals from mass surveillance by the government."], "wikipedia-1228060": ["Privacy concerns have been articulated from the beginnings of large-scale computer sharing.\nPII refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual. For example, age and physical address alone could identify who an individual is without explicitly disclosing their name, as these two factors are unique enough to identify a specific person typically. Other forms of PII may soon include GPS Tracking Data used by Apps, as the daily commute and routine information can be enough to identify an individual.\nPosting things on the Internet can be harmful or in danger of malicious attack. Some information posted on the Internet is permanent, depending on the terms of service, and privacy policies of particular services offered online. This can include comments written on blogs, pictures, and websites, such as Facebook and Twitter. It is absorbed into cyberspace and once it is posted, anyone can potentially find it and access it.\nCompanies are hired to watch what websites people visit, and then use the information, for instance by sending advertising based on one's web browsing history. Moreover, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer potentially more intrusive details about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.\nThose concerned about Internet privacy often cite a number of \"privacy risks\" \u2014 events that can compromise privacy \u2014 which may be encountered through Internet use. These range from the gathering of statistics on users to more malicious acts such as the spreading of spyware and the exploitation of various forms of bugs (software faults).\nChildren and adolescents often use the Internet (including social media) in ways which risk their privacy: a cause for growing concern among parents. Young people also may not realise that all their information and browsing can and may be tracked while visiting a particular site and that it is up to them to protect their own privacy. They must be informed about all these risks. For example, on Twitter, threats include shortened links that lead one to potentially harmful places. In their email inbox, threats include email scams and attachments that get them to install malware and disclose personal information. On Torrent sites, threats include malware hiding in video, music, and software downloads. Even when using a smartphone, threats include geolocation, meaning that one's phone can detect where they are and post it online for all to see.\nAn HTTP cookie is data stored on a user's computer that assists in automated access to websites or web features, or other state information required in complex web sites. It may also be used for user-tracking by storing special usage history data in a cookie, and such cookies\u2014for example, those used by Google Analytics\u2014are called \"tracking cookies\". Cookies are a common concern in the field of Internet privacy. Although website developers most commonly use cookies for legitimate technical purposes, cases of abuse occur. In 2009, two researchers noted that social networking profiles could be connected to cookies, allowing the social networking profile to be connected to browsing habits.\nTracking cookies and especially third-party tracking cookies are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories \u2014 a privacy concern that prompted European and US lawmakers to take action in 2011.", "The original developers of cookies intended that only the website that originally distributed cookies to users could retrieve them, therefore returning only data already possessed by the website. However, in practice programmers can circumvent this restriction. Possible consequences include:\nBULLET::::- the placing of a personally-identifiable tag in a browser to facilitate Web profiling , or\nBULLET::::- use of cross-site scripting or other techniques to steal information from a user's cookies.\nCookies are mostly harmless except for third-party cookies. These cookies are not made by the website itself, but by web banner advertising companies. These third-party cookies are so dangerous because they take the same information that regular cookies do, such as browsing habits and frequently visited websites, but then they give out this information to other companies.\nThe process of \"profiling\" (also known as \"tracking\") assembles and analyzes several events, each attributable to a single originating entity, in order to gain information (especially patterns of activity) relating to the originating entity. Some organizations engage in the profiling of people's web browsing, collecting the URLs of sites visited. The resulting profiles can potentially link with information that personally identifies the individual who did the browsing.\nProfiling becomes a more contentious privacy issue when data-matching associates the profile of an individual with personally-identifiable information of the individual.\nWhen some users choose to disable HTTP cookie to reduce privacy risks as noted, new types of cookies were invented: since cookies are advertisers' main way of targeting potential customers, and some customers were deleting cookies, some advertisers started to use persistent Flash cookies and zombie cookies. In a 2009 study, Flash cookies were found to be a popular mechanism for storing data on the top 100 most visited sites. Another 2011 study of social media found that, \u201cOf the top 100 web sites, 31 had at least one overlap between HTTP and Flash cookies.\u201d\nFlash cookies, also known as Local Shared Objects, work the same ways as normal cookies and are used by the Adobe Flash Player to store information at the user's computer. They exhibit a similar privacy risk as normal cookies, but are not as easily blocked, meaning that the option in most browsers to not accept cookies does not affect Flash cookies. One way to view and control them is with browser extensions or add-ons.\nEvercookies, created by Samy Kamkar, are JavaScript-based applications which produce cookies in a web browser that actively \"resist\" deletion by redundantly copying themselves in different forms on the user's machine (e.g., Flash Local Shared Objects, various HTML5 storage mechanisms, window.name caching, etc.), and resurrecting copies that are missing or expired. Evercookie accomplishes this by storing the cookie data in several types of storage mechanisms that are available on the local browser. It has the ability to store cookies in over ten types of storage mechanisms so that once they are on one's computer they will never be gone. Additionally, if evercookie has found the user has removed any of the types of cookies in question, it recreates them using each mechanism available.\nDevice fingerprinting is a fairly new technology that is useful in fraud prevention and safeguarding any information from one's computer. Device fingerprinting uses data from the device and browser sessions to determine the risk of conducting business with the person using the device. This technology allows companies to better assess the risks when business is conducted through sites that include, e-commerce sites, social networking and online dating sites and banks and other financial institutions. Due to the growing number of hackers and fraudsters using 'botnets' of millions of computers that are being unknowingly controlled, this technology will help not only the companies at risk but the people who are unaware their computers are being used.", "Sentinel Advanced Detection Analysis and Predator Tracking (A.D.A.P.T.) is device fingerprinting software technology that identifies the device (computer, tablet, smartphone, ...) being used to access a website. This information, in turn, can be used to help differentiate legitimate users from those using false identities or those attempting to work anonymously. A.D.A.P.T. uses only HTTP and JavaScript to identify a device and identifies devices without requesting any personal information entered directly by the user. It makes an accurate \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the device by using many different pieces of information including, operating system, browser, and PC characteristics. A.D.A.P.T. is concealed in that the user of the device has no idea that the device is being \u201cfingerprinted\u201d and there is no actual tagging of the device.\n\nCanvas fingerprinting is one of a number of browser fingerprinting techniques of tracking online users that allow websites to uniquely identify and track visitors using HTML5 canvas element instead of browser cookies or other similar means.\n\nFace recognition technology can be used to gain access to a person's private data, according to a new study. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University combined image scanning, cloud computing and public profiles from social network sites to identify individuals in the offline world. Data captured even included a user's social security number. Experts have warned of the privacy risks faced by the increased merging of our online and offline identities. The researchers have also developed an 'augmented reality' mobile app that can display personal data over a person's image captured on a smartphone screen. Since these technologies are widely available, our future identities may become exposed to anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. Researchers believe this could force us to reconsider our future attitudes to privacy.\n\nGoogle Street View, released in the U.S. in 2007, is currently the subject of an ongoing debate about possible infringement on individual privacy. In an article entitled \u201cPrivacy, Reconsidered: New Representations, Data Practices, and the Geoweb\u201d, Sarah Elwood and Agnieszka Leszczynski (2011) argue that Google Street View \u201cfacilitate[s] identification and disclosure with more immediacy and less abstraction.\u201d The medium through which Street View disseminates information, the photograph, is very immediate in the sense that it can potentially provide direct information and evidence about a person's whereabouts, activities, and private property. Moreover, the technology's disclosure of information about a person is less abstract in the sense that, if photographed, a person is represented on Street View in a virtual replication of his or her own real-life appearance. In other words, the technology removes abstractions of a person's appearance or that of his or her personal belongings \u2013 there is an immediate disclosure of the person and object, as they visually exist in real life. Although Street View began to blur license plates and people's faces in 2008, the technology is faulty and does not entirely ensure against accidental disclosure of identity and private property. Elwood and Leszczynski note that \u201cmany of the concerns leveled at Street View stem from situations where its photograph-like images were treated as definitive evidence of an individual\u2019s involvement in particular activities.\u201d In one instance, Ruedi Noser, a Swiss politician, barely avoided public scandal when he was photographed in 2009 on Google Street View walking with a woman who was not his wife \u2013 the woman was actually his secretary. Similar situations occur when Street View provides high-resolution photographs \u2013 and photographs hypothetically offer compelling objective evidence. But as the case of the Swiss politician illustrates, even supposedly compelling photographic evidence is sometimes subject to gross misinterpretation. This example further suggests that Google Street View may provide opportunities for privacy infringement and harassment through public dissemination of the photographs. Google Street View does, however, blur or remove photographs of individuals and private property from image frames if the individuals request further blurring and/or removal of the images.", "Public officials and Google account users are worried about online safety because of all this information being gathered from multiple sources.\nAdditionally, some fear the sharing of data amongst Google services could lead to revelations of identities. Many using pseudonyms are concerned about this possibility, and defend the role of pseudonyms in literature and history.\nSearch engines such as Startpage.com, Disconnect.me and Scroogle (defunct since 2012) anonymize Google searches.\nThe advent of the Web 2.0 has caused social profiling and is a growing concern for Internet privacy.\nIn 2013 a class action lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user messages for web links, translating them to \u201clikes\u201d on the user's Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. \"Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA also referred to as the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code,\" the plaintiffs said.\nIt is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open.\nIn addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and it is important to consider that when interacting online.", "Which information an ISP collects, what it does with that information, and whether it informs its consumers, pose significant privacy issues. Beyond the usage of collected information typical of third parties, ISPs sometimes state that they will make their information available to government authorities upon request. In the US and other countries, such a request does not necessarily require a warrant.\nAn ISP cannot know the contents of properly-encrypted data passing between its consumers and the Internet. For encrypting web traffic, https has become the most popular and best-supported standard. Even if users encrypt the data, the ISP still knows the IP addresses of the sender and of the recipient. (However, see the IP addresses section for workarounds.)\nAn Anonymizer such as I2P \u2013 The Anonymous Network or Tor can be used for accessing web services without them knowing one's IP address and without one's ISP knowing what the services are that one accesses. Additional software has been developed that may provide more secure and anonymous alternatives to other applications. For example, Bitmessage can be used as an alternative for email and Cryptocat as an alternative for online chat. On the other hand, in addition to End-to-End encryption software, there are web services such as Qlink which provide privacy through a novel security protocol which does not require installing any software.\nGeneral concerns regarding Internet user privacy have become enough of a concern for a UN agency to issue a report on the dangers of identity fraud.\nHTML5 expands the number of methods given to a website to store information locally on a client as well as the amount of data that can be stored. As such, privacy risks are increased. For instance, merely erasing cookies may not be enough to remove potential tracking methods since data could be mirrored in web storage, another means of keeping information in a user's web browser. HTML5 also expands access to user media, potentially granting access to a computer's microphone or webcam, a capability previously only possible through the use of plug-ins like Flash. It is also possible to find a user's geographical location using the geolocation API. With this expanded access comes increased potential for abuse as well as more vectors for attackers.\nBig Data is generally defined as the rapid accumulation and compiling of massive amounts of information that is being exchanged over digital communication systems. This information is collected from all around the Internet, such as by popular services like Facebook, Google, Apple, Spotify or GPS systems. Big Data provides companies with the ability to:\n- Infer detailed psycho-demographic profiles of internet users, even if they were not directly expressed or indicated by users.\n- Use clickstream analysis and data mining to detect fraudulent behavior.\n- Analyze data from social media to detect new market trends and changes in demand.\n- Determine root causes of failures, issues and defects by investigating user sessions, network logs and machine sensors.\nOther potential Internet privacy risks:\n- Malware is a term short for \"malicious software\" and is used to describe software to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network whether that is through the use of a virus, trojan horse, spyware, etc.\n- Spyware is a piece of software that obtains information from a user's computer without that user's consent.\n- A web bug is an object embedded into a web page or email and is usually invisible to the user of the website or reader of the email. It allows checking to see if a person has looked at a particular website or read a specific email message.\n- Phishing is a criminally fraudulent process of trying to obtain sensitive information such as user names, passwords, credit card or bank information.\n- Pharming is a hacker's attempt to redirect traffic from a legitimate website to a completely different internet address.\n- Social engineering where people are manipulated or tricked into performing actions or divulging confidential information.\n- Malicious proxy server (or other \"anonymity\" services).\n- Use of weak passwords that are short, consist of all numbers, all lowercase or all uppercase letters, or that can be easily guessed such as single words, common phrases, a person's name, a pet's name, the name of a place, an address, a phone number, a social security number, or a birth date.\n- WebRTC is a protocol which suffers from a serious security flaw that compromises the privacy of VPN-tunnels, by allowing the true IP address of the user to be read. It is enabled by default in major browsers such as Firefox and Google Chrome.", "While dealing with the issue of internet privacy, one must first be concerned with not only the technological implications such as damaged property, corrupted files, and the like, but also with the potential for implications on their real lives. One such implication, which is rather commonly viewed as being one of the most daunting fears risks of the Internet, is the potential for identity theft. Although it is a typical belief that larger companies and enterprises are the usual focus of identity thefts, rather than individuals, recent reports seem to show a trend opposing this belief. Specifically, it was found in a 2007 \u201cInternet Security Threat Report\u201d that roughly ninety-three percent of \u201cgateway\u201d attacks were targeted at unprepared home users. The term \u201cgateway\u201d attack was used to refer to attack which aimed not at stealing data immediately, but rather at gaining access for future attacks. \n\nBut how, one might ask, is this still thriving given the increasing emphasis on internet security? The simple, but unfortunate solution, according to Symantec's \u201cInternet Security Threat Report\u201d, is that of the expanding \u201cunderground economy\u201d. With more than fifty percent of the supporting servers located in the United States, this \u201cunderground economy\u201d has become a haven for internet thieves, who use the system in order to sell stolen information. These pieces of information can range from generic things such as a user account or email to something as personal as a bank account number and PIN. \n\nWhile the processes these internet thieves use are abundant and unique, one popular trap unsuspecting people fall into is that of online purchasing. This is not to allude to the idea that every purchase one makes online will leave them susceptible to identity theft, but rather that it increases the chances. In fact, in a 2001 article titled \u201cConsumer Watch\u201d, the popular online site PC World went as far as calling secure e-shopping a myth. Though unlike the \u201cgateway\u201d attacks mentioned above, these incidents of information being stolen through online purchases generally are more prevalent in medium to large sized e-commerce sites, rather than smaller individualized sites. This is assumed to be a result of the larger consumer population and purchases, which allow for more potential leeway with information.\n\nUltimately, however, the potential for a violation of one's privacy is typically out of their hands after purchasing from an online \u201ce-tailer\u201d or store. One of the most common forms in which hackers receive private information from online \u201ce-tailers\u201d actually comes from an attack placed upon the site's servers responsible for maintaining information about previous transactions. For as experts explain, these \u201ce-tailers\u201d are not doing nearly enough to maintain or improve their security measures. Even those sites that clearly present a privacy or security policy can be subject to hackers\u2019 havoc as most policies only rely upon encryption technology which only applies to the actual transfer of a customer's data."], "wikipedia-8223796": ["Sensitive information such as personal information and identity, passwords are often associated with personal property (for example, bank accounts) and privacy and may present security concerns if leaked. Unauthorized access and usage of private information may result in consequence such as identity theft, as well as theft of property. Common causes of information security breaches include: Phishing is a type of scam where the scammers disguise as a trustworthy source in attempt to obtain private information such as passwords, and credit card information, etc. through the internet. These fake websites are often designed to look identical to their legitimate counterparts to avoid suspicion from the user. Internet scams are schemes that deceive the user in various ways in attempt to take advantage of them. Internet scams often aim to cheat the victim of personal property directly rather than personal information through false promises, confidence tricks and more. Malware, particularly spyware, is malicious software disguised as software designed to collect and transmit private information, such as password, without the user's consent or knowledge. They are often distributed through e-mail, software and files from unofficial locations. Malware is one of the most prevalent security concerns as often it is impossible to determine whether a file is infected, despite the source of the file. Common threats to personal safety include: phishing, internet scams, malware, cyberstalking, cyberbullying, online predations and sextortion. Cyberstalking is the use of the Internet or other electronic means to stalk or harass an individual, group, or organization. It may include false accusations, defamation, slander and libel. It may also include monitoring, identity theft, threats, vandalism, solicitation for sex, or gathering information that may be used to threaten, embarrass or harass. Cyberbullying is the use of electronic means such as instant messaging, social media, e-mail and other forms of online communication with the intent to abuse, intimidate, or overpower an individual or group. Online predation is the act of engaging an underage minor into inappropriate sexual relationships through the internet. Online predators may attempt to initiate and seduce minors into relationships through the use of chat rooms or internet forums. Various websites on the internet contain material that some deem offensive, distasteful or explicit, which may often be not of the user's liking. Such websites may include internet, shock sites, hate speech or otherwise inflammatory content. Such content may manifest in many ways, such as pop-up ads and unsuspecting links. Sextortion, especially via the use of webcams, is a concern, especially for those who use webcams for flirting and cybersex. Often this involves a cybercriminal posing as someone else - such as an attractive person - initiating communication of a sexual nature with the victim. The victim is then..."], "wikipedia-2041117": ["Privacy concerns with social networking services have been raised growing concerns among users on the dangers of giving out too much personal information and the threat of sexual predators. Users of these services also need to be aware of data theft or viruses. However, large services, such as Myspace and Netlog, often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents. In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken. Furthermore, there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may, in fact, be retained and passed to third parties. This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site Quechup harvested e-mail addresses from users' e-mail accounts for use in a spamming operation.\n\nPrivacy on social networking sites can be undermined by many factors. For example, users may disclose personal information, sites may not take adequate steps to protect user privacy, and third parties frequently use information posted on social networks for a variety of purposes. \"For the Net generation, social networking sites have become the preferred forum for social interactions, from posturing and role playing to simply sounding off. However, because such forums are relatively easy to access, posted content can be reviewed by anyone with an interest in the users' personal information\". The UK government has plans to monitor traffic on social networks. As well, schemes similar to e-mail jamming have been proposed for networks such as Twitter and Facebook. These would involve \"friending\" and \"following\" large numbers of random people to thwart attempts at network analysis. Privacy concerns have been found to differ between users according to gender and personality. Women are less likely to publish information that reveals methods of contacting them. Personality measures openness, extraversion, and conscientiousness were found to positively affect the willingness to disclose data, while neuroticism decreases the willingness to disclose personal information.", "The debate questions to what extent the design of these systems is compromising the needs, privacy and information of the users. More research is needed to evaluate if allowing advertising to access user information to specifically tailor content to their choices and interactions, for example by placing ads within their personal feeds and throughout their use of the site, is compromising the user's information and social wellbeing. John Herrman (2018) compares the function of algorithms in adjusting content to omniscience and recounts the unpleasant experiences that coincide as a result. He calls to web browsing on Amazon, where products he browsed through briefly reappear on other news feeds, including his Instagram feed. He outlines the experience as if the networks \u201c[have] got eyes everywhere,\u201d and suggests that this looming omniscience may alter how we interact online, even \u201crisk driving away followers in the process.\u201d This may deter users from engaging in social interactions online and points to how much advertisers are able to tailor information to their intended audience.\n\nThrough data mining, companies are able to improve their sales and profitability. With this data, companies create customer profiles that contain customer demographics and online behavior. A recent strategy has been the purchase and production of \"network analysis software.\" This software is able to sort out through the influx of social networking data for any specific company. Facebook has been especially important to marketing strategists. Facebook's controversial \"Social Ads\" program gives companies access to the millions of profiles in order to tailor their ads to a Facebook user's own interests and hobbies. However, rather than sell actual user information, Facebook sells tracked \"social actions.\" That is, they track the websites a user uses outside of Facebook through a program called Facebook Beacon.\n\nCases like these have created some privacy implications as to whether or not companies should have the right to look at employees' social network profiles. In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords. According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked hard to give its users the tools to control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation to Facebook.\n\nThe relative freedom afforded by social networking services has caused concern regarding the potential of its misuse by individual patrons. In October 2006, a fake MySpace profile created in the name of Josh Evans by Lori Janine Drew led to the suicide of Megan Meier. The event incited global concern regarding the use of social networking services for bullying purposes.\n\nThere are different forms where user data in social networks are accessed and updated without a user's permission. One study highlighted that the most common incidents included inappropriate comments posted on social networking sites (43%), messages sent to contacts that were never authored (25%) and change of personal details (24%). The most incidents are carried out by the victim's friends (36%) or partners (21%) and one in ten victims say their ex-partner has logged into their account without prior consent. The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011.", "There is a growing number of social network users who decide to quit their user account by committing a so-called virtual identity suicide or Web 2.0 suicide. A 2013 study in the journal \"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking\" investigated this phenomenon from the perspective of Facebook users. The number one reason for these users was privacy concerns (48%), being followed by a general dissatisfaction with the social networking website (14%), negative aspects regarding social network friends (13%) and the feeling of getting addicted to the social networking website (6%). Facebook quitters were found to be more concerned about privacy, more addicted to the Internet and more conscientious.\n\nThe increasing number of messages and social relationships embedded in SNS also increases the amount of social information demanding a reaction from SNS users. Consequently, SNS users perceive they are giving too much social support to other SNS friends. This dark side of SNS usage is called 'social overload'. It is caused by the extent of usage, number of friends, subjective social support norms, and type of relationship (online-only vs offline friends) while age has only an indirect effect. The psychological and behavioral consequences of social overload include perceptions of SNS exhaustion, low user satisfaction, and high intentions to reduce or stop using SNS.\n\nSmartphones and social networking services enable us to stay connected continuously with people around us or far away from us, which however is sometimes the root of our anxiety in social life. The eager to know what everyone was saying and the tendency to see if anyone shared new things are typical \"symptoms\" of this anxiety called FoMO. There is a study that examined possible connections between FOMO and social media engagement indicating that FoMO was associated with lower need satisfaction, mood and life satisfaction.\n\nAnother type of social anxiety is the FoBM (fear of being missed). It comes from the situation that we can't produce share-content for people to consume. The FoBM is a counterpart of FoMO; however, compared to FoMO it may have a more serious impact since the exclusion from the conversation can result in continuous exclusion later."], "wikipedia-16260775": ["Privacy can be decomposed to the limitation of others' access to an individual with \"three elements of secrecy, anonymity, and solitude.\" Anonymity refers to the individual's right to protection from undesired attention. Solitude refers to the lack of physical proximity of an individual to others. Secrecy refers to the protection of personalized information from being freely distributed. Individuals surrender private information when conducting transactions and registering for services. Ethical business practice protects the privacy of their customers by securing information which may contribute to the loss of secrecy, anonymity, and solitude. Credit card information, social security numbers, phone numbers, mothers' maiden names, addresses and phone numbers freely collected and shared over the internet may lead to a loss of Privacy. Fraud and impersonation are some of the malicious activities that occur due to the direct or indirect abuse of private information. Identity theft is rising rapidly due to the availability of private information in the internet. For instance, seven million Americans fell victim to identity theft in 2002, and nearly 12 million Americans were victims of identity theft in 2011 making it the fastest growing crime in the United States. Public records search engines and databases are the main culprits contributing to the rise of cybercrime."], "wikipedia-48736239": ["Leaked NSA documents obtained by \"The Guardian\" and \"The Washington Post\" in June 2013 included Google on the list of companies that cooperate with the NSA's PRISM surveillance program, which authorizes the government to secretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Following the leak, government officials acknowledged the existence of the program. According to the leaked documents, the NSA has direct access to servers of those companies, and the amount of data collected through the program had been growing fast in years prior to the leak. Google has denied the existence of any \"government backdoor\".\n\nGoogle Chrome includes a private browsing feature called \"incognito browsing mode\" that prevents the browser from permanently storing any browsing or download history information or cookies. Using incognito mode prevents tracking by the browser. However, the individual websites visited can still track and store information about visits. In particular any searches performed while signed into a Google account will be saved as part of the account's web history. In addition, other programs such as those used to stream media files, which are invoked from within Chrome, may still record history information, even when incognito mode is being used. Furthermore, a limitation of Apple's iOS 7 platform allows some information from incognito browser windows to leak to regular Chrome browser windows. There are concerns that these limitations may have led Chrome users to believe that incognito mode provides more privacy protection than it actually does.\n\nDuring 2006\u201310, Google Streetview camera cars collected about 600 gigabytes of data from users of unencrypted public and private Wi-Fi networks in more than 30 countries. No disclosures nor privacy policy was given to those affected, nor to the owners of the Wi-Fi stations. Google apologized and said that they were \"acutely aware that we failed badly here\" in terms of privacy protection, that they were not aware of the problem until an inquiry from German regulators was received, that the private data was collected inadvertently, and that none of the private data was used in Google's search engine or other services. A representative of Consumer Watchdog replied, \"Once again, Google has demonstrated a lack of concern for privacy.

Of course, user profiling is not a bad thing per se, since it allows to deliver more relevant ad content to the user. However, as targeted ads are believed to produce increased revenues, various intermediary companies (such as ad platforms and ad exchanges) are tracking users at scale, and often in an unregulated manner, which has resulted in a privacy nightmare~\\cite{MyAdChoices_Jagdish16}. Advertising is currently the main business model of ``free'' content and services on the Web, though if something is free it usually means that the user is the product. This dystopian reality evokes a disconcerting dichotomy between, on the one hand, having to accept a digital life with no privacy and, on the other hand, retaining our privacy by being off the digital life. Privacy is essential for the citizens of both the physical and the digital world. But also privacy is constantly being juxtaposed with competing goods and interests, balanced against disparate needs and demands~\\cite{Pozen16}. More importantly, the loss of privacy translates into a loss of freedom. In other words, freedom of expression is threatened by the surveillance of our digital traces; thought patterns and intentions can be extrapolated from website visits (rightly or wrongly), and the knowledge that we are being surveyed can make one less likely to research a particular topic. And even efforts to regulate the web tracking landscape, such as the DNT Header, require good faith cooperation from the parties at the other end of the web connection, which is not always guaranteed. In fact, most tracking domains and ad platforms are unlikely to ignore user tracking, because they make their business out of these data.

The recent proliferation of intrusive and privacy-invasive ads has raised serious concerns among users and industry regulatory bodies, with initial user reaction reflected on the swift adoption of ad blocking solutions. In fact, most of the popular browser extensions for Mozilla Firefox are related to ad blocking and user privacy. While extensions like these have been successful in mitigating the user's exposure to web tracking, they eventually hurt web revenue streams, leading to the so called ``tragedy of the commons''~\\cite{Cows2017}, where the common resource (user attention) will be depleted due to ad blocking. Luckily, some effort has been put to regulate the web tracking landscape, like self-initiatives from the ad industry that include recommendations for good practices~\\cite{iab_guidelines} and transparency tools such as AdChoices, to help users understand why they receive specific ads. Along the same line, privacy-preserving web browsers allow users to have more control of their online privacy and, at the same time, a financial incentive by the ads that they receive while surfing the web. Moreover, in 2018 the European Union set in place the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)~\\cite{gdpr} and the state of California in United States enforced the Consumer Privacy Act~\\cite{CCPA}. Other countries are also following the same route, yet currently online advertising is ubiquitous. Also, it remains the dominant monetization model on the Web, with constantly increasing growth rates and revenues. This has promoted advancements in user tracking and profiling technologies that allow to serve more relevant ad content to the user, and at a higher premium, known as targeted ads or Online Behavioral Advertising~\\cite{Beals_2010, Carrascosa_2015}. Web tracking and user profiling rely on mechanisms to uniquely identify and track the user's online behavior over time, including e.g., geolocation, visited pages, search keywords, and social network activity. All of these in order to better understand the user intentions and interests. However, a less known method to profile the user is by means of mouse cursor tracking. This technology has been used successfully to inform usability tests~\\cite{Atterer:2006:KUM:1135777.1135811}, predict user engagement~\\cite{Arapakis:2014:UWE:2661829.2661909} and intent~\\cite{Guo:2008:EMM:1390334.1390462, MARTINALBO2016989}, detect searcher frustration~\\cite{Feild:2010:PSF:1835449.1835458}, and infer user attention to parts of a web page~\\cite{Arapakis:2016:PUE:2911451.2911505}, among other tasks. Unfortunately, because mouse cursor tracking can be performed unobtrusively~\\cite{LEIVA2015114} and at scale~\\cite{Huang:2011:NCN:1978942.1979125}, it has opened the door to a brand new wave of massive tracking campaigns and companies that hide behind laudable objectives, such as providing fine-grained, in-page analytics (e.g., hovered and clicked items, scroll reach, speed of browsing) to the website owners. Interestingly, by tracking the mouse cursor it is possible to profile the user demographics, namely predicting age~\\cite{Takashi2015, Yamauchi2014} and gender~\\cite{Kratky:2016, Pentel2017}, a piece of valuable personal data that most users are unaware of~\\cite{Carrascal13_pii}.

However, the cookie-based approach remains to this day the dominant one, since it is fully supported by all web browsers. With a cookie identifying the user's browser, a third party domain can track the user activity across websites using redirection techniques or providing a free service that makes cross-domain tracking possible, such as the Facebook `Like' button or social media sharing plugins for WordPress. Then, by analyzing the content of the browsed websites, the tracking domain can effortlessly -- and at an unprecedented scale -- derive users' intentions and interests, alongside with other sensitive profiling information~\\cite{Iordanou2019WhosTS, Ren_2016}. There is a plethora of work that capitalize on user profiling based on how we browse. For example, our browsing history is used to detect targeted ads~\\cite{Carrascosa_2015, MyAdChoices_Jagdish16} or even identify which attribute or user action triggered a specific ad~\\cite{xray, Wills_2012}. Olejnik et al.~\\cite{Olejnik12} noticed that, with just 4 visited websites, it is possible to uniquely identify users in 97\\% of cases. At the same time, Web users are concerned about third-party tracking~\\cite{McDonald10}, especially about location access and inferring demographics~\\cite{Wills10}. Researchers have found that people are likely to take actions to protect their privacy~\\cite{Malandrino13}, including the payment of a premium fee if needed~\\cite{Tsai11}. And while some websites and tracking companies inform users about their data practices through privacy policies and sometimes provide opt-outs~\\cite{Schaub16}, these measures are insufficient. Today, advancements in web advertising provide new opportunities to trackers and advertisers to extend their visibility. Online ads are rendered dynamically during the load time of the browsed website, most of the time as a result of additional (tracking) JavaScript code that is injected on the fly~\\cite{Iordanou_2018}. This opens the door to more sophisticated tracking techniques, among which we find mouse cursor tracking to be an underestimated one. In the following section, we highlight how this technology has been used in various scenarios and how pervasive it has become. In fact, today most websites include analytics scripts, and a large number of them contains some mouse tracking script~\\cite{Englehardt17}. Users consider ad targeting useful because it highlights relevant information, but at the same time they find the underlying data collection alarming~\\cite{Ur12} and invasive~\\cite{McDonald10_attitudes}. Plane et al.~\\cite{Plane17} found that users were more concerned if an ad was targeted based on demographics, such as age, gender, or race, than based on interests. Overall, users do not want targeted advertising when they are made aware of the data collection methods employed by the advertisers~\\cite{Turow09}, and consider targeting based on demographics to be discriminatory~\\cite{Sweeney13}. We, therefore, hypothesize that it could be possible to derive demographics information from mouse movements at scale, and that a privacy issue may emerge if people follow unethical practices and make an uncontrolled use of the technology."], "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/35": ["Mouse cursor tracking is very difficult to avoid while browsing the Web today. Our mouse movements can be tracked silently at scale, in Incognito mode, and even without JavaScript enabled~\\cite{Huang10_css}. Being a low-cost and reasonable proxy of visual attention, mouse cursor tracking cannot be discounted from being a modern ``Trojan horse''. Our analysis corroborates this account and demonstrates that, through a very simple machine learning implementation, we can infer people's gender or age inadvertently. We do not argue, however, that mouse tracking should be removed from any website, as it may be a valuable data source for various application scenarios. Rather, we find it disconcerting that currently there is no way for end-users to opt-out easily. The work presented here serves a dual purpose. First, it aims at raising awareness on the emerging privacy threats in the online world and exposes some of the unaccounted ---yet sizeable risks--- of tracking technologies.

Social networking sites themselves can take a responsibility and make such awareness possible by means of participatory methods by virtual online means.\nSection::::Causes.:Data access methods.\nThere are several ways for third parties to access user information. Flickr is an example of a social media website that provides geotagged photos that allows users to view the exact location of where a person is visiting or staying. Geotagged photos make it easy for third party users to see where an individual is located or traveling to. There is also growing use of phishing, which reveals sensitive information through secretive links and downloads through email, messages, and other communications. Social media has opened up an entirely new realm for hackers to get information from normal posts and messages.\nSection::::Causes.:Data access methods.:Share it with third parties.\nNearly all of the most popular applications on Facebook\u2014including Farmville, Causes, and Quiz Planet\u2014have been sharing users' information with advertising and tracking companies. \nEven though Facebook's privacy policy says they can provide \"any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected\" to advertisers, they violate this policy. If a user clicked a specific ad in a page, Facebook will send the address of this page to advertisers, which will directly lead to a profile page. In this case, it is easy to identify users' names. For example, Take With Me Learning is an app that allows teachers and students to keep track of their academic process. The app requires personal information that includes, school name, user's name, email, and age. But Take With Me Learning was created by company that was known for illegally gathering student's personal information without their knowledge and selling it to advertisement companies. This company had violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), used to keep children safe from identity theft while using the internet. Most recently, Facebook has been scrutinized for the collection of users' data by Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica was collecting data from Facebook users\u2019 after they agreed to take a psychology questionnaire. Not only could Cambridge Analytica access the data of the person who took the survey, they could also access all of the data of that person's Facebook friends. This data was then used to hopefully sway people's\u2019 beliefs in hopes that they would vote for a certain politician. While what Cambridge Analytica did by collecting the data may or may not be illegal, they then transferred the data they acquired to third parties so that it could be used to sway voters.\nSection::::Causes.:Data access methods.:API.\nApplication programming interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. By using query language, sharing content and data between communities and applications became much easier.\nAPIs simplify all that by limiting outside program access to a specific set of features\u2014often enough, requests for data of one sort or another. APIs clearly define exactly how a program will interact with the rest of the software world\u2014saving time.\nAn API allows software to \u201cspeak with other software.\u201d Furthermore, an API can collect and provide information that is not publicly accessible. This is extremely enticing for researchers due to the greater number of possible avenues of research. The use of an API for data collection can be a focal point of the privacy conversation, because while the data can be anonymous, the difficulty is understanding when it becomes an invasion of privacy. Personal information can be collected en masse, but the debate over whether it breaches personal privacy is due to the inability to match this information with specific people.\nThere have however been some concerns with API because of the recent scandal between Facebook and the political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica. What happened was \u201cFacebook allowed a third-party developer to engineer an application for the sole purpose of gathering data. And the developer was able to exploit a loophole to gather information on not only people who used the app but all their friends \u2014 without them knowing.\u201d \nSection::::Causes.:Data access methods.:Search engines.\nSearch engines are an easy way to find information without scanning every site yourself. Keywords that are typed into a search box will lead to the results. So it is necessary to make sure that the keywords typed are precise and correct. \nThere are many of such search engines, some of which may lead the user to fake sites which may obtain personal information or are laden with viruses. Furthermore, some search engines, like DuckDuckGo, will not violate the user's privacy.\nSection::::Causes.:Data access methods.:Location Data.\nOn most social media websites, user's geographical location can be gathered either by users (through voluntary check-in applications like Foursquare and Facebook Places) or by applications (through technologies like IP address geolocation, cellphone network triangulation, RFID and GPS). The approach used matters less than the result which holds that the content produced is coupled with the geographical location where the user produced it. Additionally, many applications attach the contents of other forms of information like OS language, device type and capture time. The result is that by posting, tweeting or taking pictures, users produce and share an enormous amount of personal information.", "According to Gary Kovacs's speech about Tracking our online trackers, when he used the internet to find an answer to a question, \"We are not even 2 bites into breakfast and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me\", and he was navigated by 4 of them.\nSocial profiling allows for Facebook and other social networking media websites of filtering through the advertisements, assigning specific ones to specific age groups, gender groups, and even ethnicities.\nData aggregation sites like Spokeo have highlighted the feasibility of aggregating social data across social sites as well as integrating it with public records. A 2011 study highlighted these issues by measuring the amount of unintended information leakage over a large number of users with the varying number of social networks. It identified and measured information that could be used in attacks against what-you-know security.\nStudies have also pointed to most social networks unintentionally providing 3rd party advertising and tracking sites with personal information. It raises the issue of private information inadvertently being sent to 3rd party advertising sites via Referrer strings or cookies.\nCivil libertarians worry that social networking sites, particularly Facebook, have greatly diminished user confidentiality in numerous ways. For one thing, when social media platforms store private data, they also have complete access to that material as well. To sustain their profitability, applications like Facebook examine and market personal information by logging data through cookies, small files that stockpile the data on someone's device. Companies, such as Facebook, carry extensive amounts of private user information on file, regarding individuals\u2019 , \u201clikes, dislikes, and preferences\u201d, which are of high value to marketers. As Facebook reveals user information to advertising and marketing organizations, personalized endorsements will appear on news feeds based on \u201csurfing behavior, hobbies, or pop culture preferences\u201d. For those reasons, Facebook's critics fear that social networking companies may seek business ventures with stockholders by sharing user information in the exchange of profits. Additionally, they argue that since Facebook demonstrates an illusion of privacy presented by a \u201cfor-friends-only\u201d type of platform, individuals find themselves more inclined to showcase more personal information online. According to the critics, users might notice that the sponsorships and commercials are tailored to their disclosed private data, which could result in a sense of betrayal.\nTwitter has admitted that they have scanned and imported their user's phone contacts onto the website database so that they can learn more about their users. Most users were unaware that Twitter is created this way for new users to search for their friends. Twitter has stated that they will have their privacy guidelines illustrated more clearly in the future.\nIn 2015, after Facebook bought Instagram there was an option that Instagram could use its own users photos for ad purposes. This new policy was hidden in their user agreement. Users could opt out but the only way was to delete their account at before a certain deadline. Hiding this in their user agreement privacy agreement they were able to fool lots of people who did not understand what to look for. This is disclosure of information to third parties because Instagram is branching out our information to others.\nAs there is so much information provided other things can be deduced, such as the person's social security number, which can then be used as part of identity theft. In 2009, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University published a study showing that it is possible to predict most and sometimes all of an individual's 9-digit Social Security number using information gleaned from social networks and online databases. (See Predicting Social Security Numbers from Public Data by Acquisti and Gross). In response, various groups have advised that users either do not display their number, or hide it from Facebook 'friends' they do not personally know. Cases have also appeared of users having photographs stolen from social networking sites in order to assist in identity theft. There is little evidence that users of social networking sites are taking full measures to protect themselves from identity theft. For example, numerous celebrities have claimed their Twitter accounts have been hacked. According to the Huffington Post, Bulgarian IT consultant Bogomil Shopov claimed in a recent blog to have purchased personal information on more than 1 million Facebook users, for the shockingly low price of US$5.00. The data reportedly included users' full names, email addresses, and links to their Facebook pages. The following information could be used to steal the users' identities : Full names including middle name, date of birth, hometown, relationship status, residential information, other hobbies and interest.", "Section::::Potential dangers.:Sexual predators.\nMost major social networking sites are committed to ensuring that use of their services are as safe as possible. However, due to the high content of personal information placed on social networking sites, as well as the ability to hide behind a pseudo-identity, such sites have become increasingly popular for sexual prostetuited [online]. Further, lack of age verification mechanisms is a cause of concern in these social networking platforms. However, it was also suggested that the majority of these simply transferred to using the services provided by Facebook. While the numbers may remain small, it has been noted that the number of sexual prostetuites caught using social networking sites has been increasing, and has now reached an almost weekly basis. In worst cases children have become victims of pedophiles or lured to meet strangers.They say that sexual predators can lurk anonymously through the wormholes of cyberspace and access victim profiles online. A number of highly publicized cases have demonstrated the threat posed for users, such as Peter Chapman who, under a false name, added over 3,000 friends and went on to rape and murder a 17-year-old girl in 2009. In another case, a 12-year-old, Evergreen girl was safely found by the FBI with the help of Facebook, due to her mother learning of her daughter's conversation with a man she had met on the popular social networking application.\nSection::::Potential dangers.:Stalking.\nThe potential ability for stalking users on social networking sites has been noted and shared. Popular social networking sites make it easy to build a web of friends and acquaintances and share with them your photos, whereabouts, contact information, and interests without ever getting the chance to actually meet them. With the amount of information that users post about themselves online, it is easy for users to become a victim of stalking without even being aware of the risk. 63% of Facebook profiles are visible to the public, meaning if you Google someone's name and you add \"+Facebook\" in the search bar you pretty much will see most of the person profile. A study of Facebook profiles from students at Carnegie Mellon University revealed that about 800 profiles included current resident and at least two classes being studied, theoretically allowing viewers to know the precise location of individuals at specific times. AOL attracted controversy over its instant messenger AIM which permits users to add 'buddies' without their knowing, and therefore track when a user is online. Concerns have also been raised over the relative ease for people to read private messages or e-mails on social networking sites. Cyberstalking is a criminal offense that comes into play under state anti-stalking laws, slander laws, and harassment laws. A cyberstalking conviction can result in a restraining order, probation, or even criminal penalties against the assailant, including jail.\nSome applications are explicitly centered on \"cyber stalking.\" An application named \"Creepy\" can track a person's location on a map using photos uploaded to Twitter or Flickr. When a person uploads photos to a social networking site, others are able to track their most recent location. Some smartphones are able to embed the longitude and latitude coordinates into the photo and automatically send this information to the application. Anybody using the application can search for a specific person and then find their immediate location. This poses many potential threats to users who share their information with a large group of followers.\nFacebook \"Places,\" is a Facebook service, which publicizes user location information to the networking community. Users are allowed to \"check-in\" at various locations including retail stores, convenience stores, and restaurants. Also, users are able to create their own \"place,\" disclosing personal information onto the Internet. This form of location tracking is automated and must be turned off manually. Various settings must be turned off and manipulated in order for the user to ensure privacy. According to epic.org, Facebook users are recommended to: (1) disable \"Friends can check me in to Places,\" (2) customize \"Places I Check In,\" (3) disable \"People Here Now,\" and (4) uncheck \"Places I've Visited.\". Moreover, the Federal Trade Commission has received two complaints in regards to Facebook's \"unfair and deceptive\" trade practices, which are used to target advertising sectors of the online community. \"Places\" tracks user location information and is used primarily for advertising purposes. Each location tracked allows third party advertisers to customize advertisements that suit one's interests. Currently, the Federal Trade Commissioner along with the Electronic Privacy Information Center are shedding light on the issues of location data tracking on social networking sites.\nSection::::Potential dangers.:Unintentional fame.\nUnintentional fame can harm a person's character, reputation, relationships, chance of employment, and privacy- ultimately infringing upon a person's right to the pursuit of happiness. Many cases of unintentional fame have led its victims to take legal action. The right to be forgotten is a legal concept that includes removing one's information from the media that was once available to the public. The right to be forgotten is currently enforced in the European Union and Argentina, and has been recognized in various cases in the United States, particularly in the case of Melvin v. Reid. However, there is controversy surrounding the right to be forgotten in the United States as it conflicts with the public's right to know and the Constitution's First Amendment, restricting one's \u201cright to freedom of speech and freedom of expression\u201d (Amendment I).\nPrivacy concerns have also been raised over a number of high-profile incidents which can be considered embarrassing for users. Various internet memes have been started on social networking sites or been used as a means towards their spread across the internet. In 2002, a Canadian teenager became known as the Star Wars Kid after a video of him using a golf club as a light sabre was posted on the internet without his consent. The video quickly became a hit, much to the embarrassment of the teenager, who claims to have suffered as a result. Along with other incidents of videos being posted on social networking sites, this highlights the ability for personal information to be rapidly transferred between users.\nSection::::Potential dangers.:Employment.\nIssues relating to privacy and employment are becoming a concern with regards to social networking sites. As of 2008, it has been estimated by CareerBuilder.com that one in five employers search social networking sites in order to screen potential candidates (increasing from only 11% in 2006). For the majority of employers, such action is to acquire negative information about candidates. For example, 41% of managers considered information relating to candidates' alcohol and drug use to be a top concern. Other concerns investigated via social networking sites included poor communication skills, inappropriate photographs, inaccurate qualifications and bad-mouthing former employers/colleagues. However, 24% manager claimed that information found on a social networking site persuaded them to hire a candidate, suggesting that a user image can be used in a positive way.\nWhile there is little doubt that employers will continue to use social networking sites as a means of monitoring staff and screening potential candidates, it has been noted that such actions may be illegal under in jurisdictions. According to Workforce.com, employers who use Facebook or Myspace could potentially face legal action:\nIf a potential employer uses a social networking site to check out a job candidate and then rejects that person based on what they see, he or she could be charged with discrimination. On August 1, 2012, Illinois joined the state of Maryland (law passed in March 2012) in prohibiting employer access to social media web sites of their employees and prospective employees. A number of other states that are also considering such prohibitory legislation (California, Delaware, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, South Carolina and Washington), as is the United States Congress. In April 2012, the Social Networking Online Protection Act (2012 H.R. 5050) was introduced in the United States House of Representatives, and the Password Protection Act of 2012 (2012 S. 3074) was introduced in the United States Senate in May 2012, which prohibit employers from requiring access to their employees' social media web sites.\nWith the recent concerns about new technologies, the United States is now developing laws and regulations to protect certain aspects of people's information on different medias.[CR4] For example, 12 states in the US currently have laws specifically restricting employers from demanding access to their employees\u2019 social media sites when those sites are not fully public. (The states that have passed these laws are Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington.)\nMonitoring of social networking sites is not limited to potential workers. Issues relating to privacy are becoming an increasing concern for those currently in employment. A number of high-profile cases have appeared in which individuals have been sacked for posting comments on social networking which have been considered disparaging to their current employers or fellow workers. In 2009, sixteen-year-old Kimberley Swann was sacked from her position at Ivell Marketing and Logistics Limited after describing her job as 'boring'. In 2008, Virgin Atlantic sacked thirteen cabin crew staff, after it emerged they used had criticized the company's safety standards and called passengers 'chavs' on Facebook. There is no federal law that we are aware of that an employer is breaking by monitoring employees on social networking sites. In fact, employers can even hire third-party companies to monitor online employee activity for them. According to an article by Read Write Web employers use the service to \"make sure that employees don't leak sensitive information on social networks or", "Section::::Potential dangers.:Online victimization.\nSocial networks are designed for individuals to socially interact with other people over the Internet. However, some individuals engage in undesirable online social behaviors, which negatively impacts other people's online experiences. It has created a wide range of online interpersonal victimization. Some studies have shown that social network victimization appears largely in adolescent and teens, and the type of victimization includes sexual advances and harassment. Recent research has reported approximately 9% of online victimization involves social network activities. It has been noted that many of these victims are girls who have been sexually victimized over these social network sites. Research concludes that many of social network victimizations are associated with user behaviors and interaction with one another. Negative social behaviors such as aggressive attitudes and discussing sexual related topics motivate the offenders to achieve their goals. All in all, positive online social behaviors is promoted to help reduce and avoid online victimization.\nSection::::Potential dangers.:Surveillance.\nWhile the concept of a worldwide communicative network seems to adhere to the public sphere model, market forces control access to such a resource. In 2010, investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that many of the most popular applications on Facebook were transmitting identifying information about users and their friends to advertisers and internet tracking companies, which is a violation of Facebook's privacy policy. The Wall Street Journal analyzed the ten most popular Facebook apps, including Zynga's FarmVille with 57 million users, and Zynga's Mafia Wars with 21.9 million users, and found that they were transmitting Facebook user IDs to data aggregators. Every online move leaves cyber footprints that are rapidly becoming fodder for research without people ever realizing it. Using social media for academic research is accelerating and raising ethical concerns along the way, as vast amounts of information collected by private companies \u2014 including Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter \u2014 are giving new insight into all aspects of everyday life. Our social media \"audience\" is bigger than we actually know; our followers or friends aren't the only ones that can see information about us. Social media sites are collecting data from us just by searching something such as \"favorite restaurant\" on our search engine. Facebook is transformed from a public space to a behavioral laboratory,\" says the study, which cites a Harvard-based research project of 1,700 college-based Facebook users in which it became possible to \"deanonymize parts of the data set,\" or cross-reference anonymous data to make student identification possible. Some of Facebook's research on user behavior found that 71% of people drafted at least one post that they never posted. Another analyzed 400,000 posts and found that children's communication with parents decreases in frequency from age 13 but then rises when they move out.\nSection::::Potential dangers.:Law enforcement prowling the networks.\nThe FBI has dedicated undercover agents on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn. One example of investigators using Facebook to nab a criminal is the case of Maxi Sopo. Charged with bank fraud, and having escaped to Mexico, he was nowhere to be found until he started posting on Facebook. Although his profile was private, his list of friends was not, and through this vector, where he met a former official of the Justice Department, he was eventually caught .\nIn recent years, some state and local law enforcement agencies have also begun to rely on social media websites as resources. Although obtaining records of information not shared publicly by or about site users often requires a subpoena, public pages on sites such as Facebook and MySpace offer access to personal information that can be valuable to law enforcement. Police departments have reported using social media websites to assist in investigations, locate and track suspects, and monitor gang activity.\nOn October 18, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was scheduled to begin using personal information collected using social media platforms to screen immigrants arriving in the U.S. The department made this new measure known in a posting to the Federal Register in September 2017, noting that \u201c...social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results...\u201d would be included in an applicant's immigration file. This announcement, which was made relatively quietly, has received criticism from privacy advocates. The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement in late September 2017 asserting that the planned use of social media is nothing new, with one department spokesperson saying DHS has been using social media to collect information for years. According to a statement made to National Public Radio, DHS uses \u201c...social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information, and search results\u201d to keep updated records on persons of interest. According to the DHS, the posting to the Federal Register was an effort to be transparent regarding information about social media that is already being collected from immigrants.\nGovernment use of SMMS or \u201cSocial media monitoring software can be used to geographically track us as we communicate. It can chart out our relationships, networks, and associations. It can monitor protests, identify the leaders of political and social movements, and measure our influence.\u201d SMMS is also a growing industry. SMMS \u201cproducts like XI Social Discovery, Geofeedia, Dataminr, Dunami, and SocioSpyder (to name just a few) are being purchased in droves by Fortune 500 companies, politicians, law enforcement, federal agencies, defense contractors, and the military. Even the CIA has a venture fund, In-Q-Tel, that invests in SMMS technology.\u201d\nSection::::Potential dangers.:Location updates.\nFoursquare, Facebook, Loopt are application which allow users to check- in and these capabilities allows a user to share their current location information to their connection. Some of them even update their travel plans on social networking applications.However, the disclosure of location information within these networks can cause privacy concerns among mobile users. Foursquare defines another framework of action for the user. It appears to be in the interest of Foursquare that users provide many personal data that are set as public. This is illustrated, among others, by the fact that, although all the respondents want high control over the (location) privacy settings, almost none of them ever checked the Foursquare privacy settings before. Although there are algorithms using encryption, k-anonymity and noise injection algorithms, its better to understand how the location sharing works in these applications to see if they have good algorithms in place to protect location privacy.\nSection::::Potential dangers.:Invasive privacy agreements.\nAnother privacy issue with social networks is the privacy agreement. The privacy agreement states that the social network owns all of the content that users upload. This includes pictures, videos, and messages are all stored in the social networks database even if the user decides to terminate his or her account.\nPrivacy agreements oftentimes say that they can track a user's location and activity based on the device used for the site. For example, the privacy agreement for Facebook states that \"all devices that a person uses to access Facebook are recorded such as IP addresses, phone numbers, operating system and even GPS locations\". One main concern about privacy agreements are the length, because they take a lot of time to fully read and understand. Most privacy agreements state the most important information at the end because it is assumed that people will not read it completely.\nThe ethical dilemma lies in that upon the agreement to register for SNSs, the personal information disclosed is legally accessible and managed by the sites privately established online security operators and operating systems; leaving access of user data to be \"under the discretion\" of the site(s) operators. Giving rise to the moral obligation and responsibility of the sites operators to maintain private information to be within user control. However, due to the legality of outsourcing of user data upon registration- without prior discretion, data outsourcing has been frequented by SNSs operating systems- regardless of user privacy settings.\nData outsourcing has been proven to be consistently exploited since the emergence of SNSs. Employers have often been found to hire individuals or companies to search deep into the SNSs user database to find \"less than pleasant\" information regarding applicants during the review process.", "Most social networking sites require users to agree to Terms of Use policies before they use their services. Controversially, these Terms of Use declarations that users must agree to often contain clauses permitting social networking operators to store data on users, or even share it with third parties. Facebook has attracted attention over its policies regarding data storage, such as making it difficult to delete an account, holding onto data after an account is de-activated and being caught sharing personal data with third parties.\n\nBreakup Notifier is an example of a Facebook \"cyberstalking\" app that has recently been taken down. Essentially, the application notifies users when a person breaks up with their partner through Facebook, allowing users to instantly become aware of their friend's romantic activities. The concept became very popular, with the site attracting 700,000 visits in the first 36 hours; people downloaded the app 40,000 times. Just days later, the app had more than 3.6 million downloads and 9,000 Facebook likes.\n\n(2) Clicking on links. Many links which looks attractive like gift cards are specially designed by malicious users. Clicking on these links may result in losing personal information or money.\n(3) Think twice about posting revealing photos. A revealing photo could attract the attention of potential criminals.", "Additionally, Facebook has been under fire for keeping track of one's Internet usage whether users are logged into the social media site or not. A user may notice personalized ads under the 'Sponsored' area of the page. \"The company uses cookies to log data such as the date, time, URL, and your IP address whenever you visit a site that has a Facebook plug-in, such as a 'Like' button.\" Facebook claims this data is used to help improve one's experience on the website and to protect against 'malicious' activity. Another issue of privacy that Facebook uses is the new facial recognition software. This feature includes the software to identify photos that users are tagged in by developing a template based on one's facial features.\nSimilar to Rotenberg's claim that Facebook users are unclear of how or why their information has gone public, recently the Federal Trade Commission and Commerce Department have become involved. The Federal Trade Commission has recently released a report claiming that Internet companies and other industries will soon need to increase their protection for online users. Because online users often unknowingly opt in on making their information public, the FTC is urging Internet companies to make privacy notes simpler and easier for the public to understand, therefore increasing their option to opt out. Perhaps this new policy should also be implemented in the Facebook world. The Commerce Department claims that Americans, \"have been ill-served by a patchwork of privacy laws that contain broad gaps,\". Because of these broad gaps, Americans are more susceptible to identity theft and having their online activity tracked by others.\nThe illegal activities on Facebook are very widespread, in particular, phishing attacks, allowing attackers to steal other people's passwords. The Facebook users are led to land on a page where they are asked for their login information, and their personal information is stolen in that way.\nAccording to the news from \"PC World Business Center\" which was published on April 22, 2010, we can know that a hacker named Kirllos illegally stole and sold 1.5 million Facebook IDs to some business companies who want to attract potential customers by using advertisements on Facebook. Their illegal approach is that they used accounts which were bought from hackers to send advertisements to friends of users. When friends see the advertisements, they will have opinion about them, because \"People will follow it because they believe it was a friend that told them to go to this link,\" said Randy Abrams, director of technical education with security vendor Eset. There were 2.2232% of the population on Facebook that believed or followed the advertisements of their friends. Even though the percentage is small, the amount of overall users on Facebook is more than 400 million worldwide. The influence of advertisements on Facebook is so huge and obvious. According to the blog of Alan who just posted advertisements on the Facebook, he earned $300 over the 4 days. That means he can earn $3 for every $1 put into it. The huge profit attracts hackers to steal users' login information on Facebook, and business people who want to buy accounts from hackers send advertisements to users' friends on Facebook.\nA leaked document from Facebook has revealed that the company was able to identify \"insecure, worthless, stressed or defeated\" emotions, especially in teenagers, and then proceeded to inform advertisers. While similar issues have arisen in the past, this continues to make individuals\u2019 emotional states seem more like a commodity. They are able to target certain age groups depending on the time that their advertisements appear.\nRecently, there have been allegations made against Facebook accusing the app of listening in on its users through their smartphone's microphone in order to gather information for advertisers. These rumors have been proven to be false as well as impossible. For one, because it does not have a specific buzzword to listen for like the Amazon Echo, Facebook would have to record everything its users say. This kind of \u201cconstant audio surveillance would produce about 33 times more data daily than Facebook currently consumes\u201d. Additionally, it would become immediately apparent to the user as their phone's battery life would be swiftly drained by the amount of power it would take to record every conversation. Finally, it is clear that Facebook doesn't need to listen in on its users\u2019 conversations because it already has plenty of access to their data and internet search history through cookies. Facebook specifically states in their Cookies Policy that they use cookies to help display ads that will peak the users interest. They then use this information to help make recommendations for numerous businesses, organizations, associations, etc. to individuals who may be interested in the products, services or causes they offer.\nA study was conducted at Northeastern University by Alan Mislove and his colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, where an algorithm was created to try and discover personal attributes of a Facebook user by looking at their friend's list. They looked for information such as high school and college attended, major, hometown, graduation year and even what dorm a student may have lived in. The study revealed that only 5% of people thought to change their friend's list to private. For other users, 58% displayed university attended, 42% revealed employers, 35% revealed interests and 19% gave viewers public access to where they were located. Due to the correlation of Facebook friends and universities they attend, it was easy to discover where a Facebook user was based on their list of friends. This fact is one that has become very useful to advertisers targeting their audiences but is also a big risk for the privacy of all those with Facebook accounts.\nRecently, Facebook, knowingly agreed and facilitated a controversial experiment; the experiment blatantly bypassed user privacy and demonstrates the dangers and complex ethical nature of the current networking management system. The \"one week study in January of 2012\" where over 600,000 users were randomly selected to unknowingly partake in a study to determine the effect of \"emotional alteration\" by Facebook posts. Apart from the ethical issue of conducting such a study with human emotion in the first place, this is just one of the means in which data outsourcing has been used as a breach of privacy without user disclosure.\nInstagram tracks users' photos even if they do not post them using a geotag. The app geotags an uploaded image regardless of whether the user chose to share its location or not. Therefore, anybody can view the exact location where an image was uploaded on a map. This is concerning due to the fact that most people upload photos from their home or other locations they frequent a lot, and the fact that locations are so easily shared raises privacy concerns of stalking and sexual predators being able to find their target in person after discovering them online. The new Search function on Instagram combines the search of places, people, and tags to look at nearly any location on earth, allowing them to scout out a vacation spot, look inside a restaurant, and even to experience an event like they were there in person. The privacy implications of this fact is that people and companies can now see into every corner of the world, culture, and people's private lives. Additionally, this is concerning for individual privacy, because when someone searches through these features on Instagram for a specific location or place, Instagram shows them the personal photos that their users have posted, along with the likes and comments on that photo regardless of whether the poster's account is private or not. With these features, completely random people, businesses, and governments can see aspects of Instagram users' private lives. The Search and Explore pages that collect data based on user tagging illustrates how Instagram was able to create value out of the databases of information they collect on users throughout their business operations.\nSwarm is a mobile app that lets users check-in to a location and potentially make plans and set up future meetings with people nearby. This app has made it easier for people in online communities to share their locations, as well as interact with others in this community through collecting rewards such as coins and stickers through competitions with other users. If a user is on Swarm, their exact location may be broadcast even if they didn't select their location to be \"checked-in.\"", "The privacy implications of this is that people are inadvertently sharing their exact location when they do not know that they are. This plays into the privacy concerns of social media in general, because it makes it easier for other users as well as the companies this location data is shared with to track Swarm members. This tracking makes it easier for people to find their next targets for identity theft, stalking, and sexual harassment.\n\nSpokeo is a \"people-related\" search engine with results compiled through data aggregation. The site contains information such as age, relationship status, estimated personal wealth, immediate family members and home address of individual people. This information is compiled through what is already on the internet or in other public records, but the website does not guarantee accuracy.\n\nTwitter's privacy policy states that information is collected through their different web sites, application, SMS, services, APIs, and other third parties. When the user uses Twitter's service they consent to the collection, transfer, storage, manipulation, disclosure, and other uses of this information.\n\nDespite Twitter's best efforts to protect their users privacy, personal information can still be dangerous to share. There have been incidents of leaked tweets on Twitter. Leaked tweets are tweets that have been published from a private account but have been made public. This occurs when friends of someone with a private account retweet, or copy and paste, that person's tweet and so on and so forth until the tweet is made public. This can make private information public, and could possibly be dangerous.\n\nAnother issue involving privacy on Twitter deals with users unknowingly disclosing their information through tweets. Twitter has location services attached to tweets, which some users don't even know are enabled. Many users tweet about being at home and attach their location to their tweet, revealing their personal home address. This information is represented as a latitude and longitude, which is completely open for any website or application to access. WeKnowYourHouse is an example of a website that has taken this information and posted it online for anyone to see. They provide Twitter user's names and personal addresses. The owner of the site stated that he created it as a warning to show how easy it is to find and reveal personal information without the right precautions. People also tweet about going on vacation and giving the times and places of where they are going and how long they will be gone for. This has led to numerous break ins and robberies. Twitter users can avoid location services by disabling them in their privacy settings.\n\nCertain social media sites such as Ask.fm, Whisper, and Yik Yak allow users to interact anonymously. The problem with websites such as these is that \u201cdespite safeguards that allow users to report abuse, people on the site believe they can say almost anything without fear or consequences\u2014and they do.\" This is a privacy concern because users can say whatever they choose and the receiver of the message may never know who they are communicating with. Sites such as these allow for a large chance or cyberbullying or cyberstalking to occur. People seem to believe that since they can be anonymous, they have the freedom to say anything no matter how mean or malicious.\n\nSnapchat is a mobile application created by Stanford graduates Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy in September 2011. Snapchat's main feature is that the application allows users to send a photo or video, referred to as a \"snap\", to recipients of choice for up to ten seconds before it disappears. If recipients of a snap try and screenshot the photo or video sent, a notification is sent to the original sender that it was screenshot and by whom. Snapchat also has a \"stories\" feature where users can send photos to their \"story\" and friends can view the story as many times as they want until it disappears after twenty-four hours. Users have the ability to make their snapchat stories viewable to all of their friends on their friends list, only specific friends, or the story can be made public and viewed by anyone that has a snapchat account. In addition to the stories feature, messages can be sent through Snapchat. Messages disappear after they are opened unless manually saved by the user by holding down on the message until a \"saved\" notification pops up. There is no notification sent to the users that their message has been saved by the recipient, however, there is a notification sent if the message is screenshot.\n\nIn 2015, Snapchat updated their privacy policy, causing outrage from users because of changes in their ability to save user content. These rules were put in place to help Snapchat create new and cool features like being able to replay a Snapchat, and the idea of \u201clive\u201d Snapchat stories. These features require saving content to snapchat servers in order to release to other users at a later time. The update stated that it has the rights to reproduce, modify, and republish photos, as well as save those photos to Snapchat servers. Users felt uncomfortable with the idea that all photo content was saved and the idea of \u201cdisappearing photos\u201d advertised by Snapchat didn't actually disappear. There is no way to control what content is saved and what isn't. Snapchat responded to backlash by saying they needed this license to access our information in order to create new features, like the live snapchat feature.\n\nWith the 2015 new update of Snapchat, users are able to do \u201cLive Stories,\u201d which are a \u201ccollection of crowdsourced snaps for a specific event or region.\u201d By doing that, you are allowing snapchat to share your location with not just your friends, but with everyone. According to Snapchat, once you pick the option of sharing your content through a Live Story, you are providing to the company \"unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice in any and all media and distribution channels.\"", "In 2016, Snapchat released a new product called \u201cSnapchat Spectacles,\u201d which are sunglasses featuring a small camera that allow users to take photos and record up to 10 seconds of footage. The cameras in the Spectacles are connected to users\u2019 existing Snapchat accounts, so they can easily upload their content to the application. This new product has received negative feedback because the Spectacles do not stand out from normal sunglasses beyond the small cameras on the lenses. Therefore, users have the ability to record strangers without them knowing. and could potentially otherwise unwilling of the glasses may not even realize they are any different than a basic pair of shades. Critics of Snapchat Spectacles argue that this product is an invasion of privacy for the people who do not know they are being recorded by individuals who are wearing the glasses. Proponents disagree, saying that the glasses are distinguishable enough that users and people around them will notice them. Another argument in favor of the glasses is that people are already exposing themselves to similar scenarios by being in public.\n\nIn October 2016, Amnesty International released a report ranking Snapchat along with ten other leading social media applications, including Facebook, iMessage, FaceTime, and Skype on how well they protect users\u2019 privacy. The report assessed Snapchat's use of encryption and found that it ranks poorly in how it uses encryption to protect users\u2019 security as a result of not using end-to-end encryption. Because of this, third parties have the ability to access Snapchats while they are being transferred from one device to another. The report also claimed that Snapchat does not explicitly inform users in its privacy policy of the application's level of encryption or any threats the application may pose to users\u2019 rights, which further reduced its overall score. Regardless of this report, Snapchat is currently considered the most trustworthy social media platform among users.\n\nIn 2014, allegations were made against Snapchat by the Federal Trade Commission \"FTC\" for deceiving users on its privacy and security measures. Snapchat's main appeal is its marketed ability to have users' photos disappear completely after the one to ten second time frame\u2014selected by the sender to the recipient\u2014is up. However, the FTC made a case claiming this was false, making Snapchat in violation of regulations implemented to prevent deceptive consumer information. One focus of the case was that the reality of a \"snap\" lifespan is longer than most users perceive; the app's privacy policy stated that Snapchat itself temporarily stored all snaps sent, but neglected to offer users a time period during which snaps had yet to be permanently deleted and could still be retrieved. As a result, many third party applications were easily created for consumers that hold the ability to save \"snaps\" sent by users and screenshot \"snaps\" without notifying the sender.\nThe FTC also claimed that Snapchat took information from its users such as location and contact information without their consent. Despite not being written in their privacy policy, Snapchat transmitted location information from mobile devices to its analytics tracking service provider. Although \"Snapchat's privacy policy claimed that the app collected only your email, phone number, and Facebook ID to find friends for you to connect with, if you're an IOS user and entered your phone number to find friends, Snapchat collected the names and phone numbers of all the contacts in your mobile device address books without your notice or consent.\" It was disclosed that the Gibsonsec security group warned Snapchat of potential issues with their security, however no actions were taken to reinforce the system. In early 2014, 4.6 million matched usernames and phone numbers of users were publicly leaked, adding to the existing privacy controversy of the application. Finally, the FTC claimed that Snapchat failed to secure its \"find friends\" feature by not requiring phone number verification in the registration process. Users could register accounts from numbers other than their own, giving users the ability to impersonate anyone they chose. Snapchat had to release a public statement of apology to alert users of the misconducts and change their purpose to be a \"fast and fun way to communicate with photos\"."], "wikipedia-19336369": ["Web threat\nA web threat is any threat that uses the World Wide Web to facilitate cybercrime. Web threats use multiple types of malware and fraud, all of which utilize HTTP or HTTPS protocols, but may also employ other protocols and components, such as links in email or IM, or malware attachments or on servers that access the Web. They benefit cybercriminals by stealing information for subsequent sale and help absorb infected PCs into botnets.\nWeb threats pose a broad range of risks, including financial damages, identity theft, loss of confidential information/data, theft of network resources, damaged brand/personal reputation, and erosion of consumer confidence in e-commerce and online banking.\nIt is a type of threat related to information technology (IT). The IT risk, i.e. risk affecting has gained and increasing impact on society due to the spread of IT processes.\nSection::::Delivery methods.\nWeb threats can be divided into two primary categories, based on delivery method\u00a0\u2013 push and pull. Push-based threats use spam, phishing, or other fraudulent means to lure a user to a malicious (often spoofed) website which then collects information and/or injects malware. Push attacks use phishing, DNS poisoning (or pharming), and other means to appear to originate from a trusted source.\nPrecisely-targeted push-based web threats are often referred to as spear phishing to reflect the focus of their data gathering attack. Spear phishing typically targets specific individuals and groups for financial gain. In other push-based web threats, malware authors use social engineering such as enticing subject lines that reference holidays, popular personalities, sports, pornography, world events and other hot topics to persuade recipients to open the email and follow links to malicious websites or open attachments with malware that accesses the Web.\nPull-based web threats are often referred to as \u201cdrive-by\u201d threats by experts (and more commonly as \u201cdrive-by downloads\u201d by journalists and the general public), since they can affect any website visitor. Cybercriminals infect legitimate websites, which unknowingly transmit malware to visitors or alter search results to take users to malicious websites. Upon loading the page, the user\u2019s browser passively runs a malware downloader in a hidden HTML frame (IFRAME) without any user interaction.\nSection::::Growth of web threats.\nGiorgio Maone wrote in 2008 that \"if today\u2019s malware runs mostly runs on Windows because it\u2019s the commonest executable platform, tomorrow\u2019s will likely run on the Web, for the very same reason. Because, like it or not, the Web is already a huge executable platform, and we should start thinking of it this way, from a security perspective.\"\nThe growth of web threats is a result of the popularity of the Web\u00a0\u2013 a relatively unprotected, widely and consistently used medium that is crucial to business productivity, online banking, and e-commerce as well as the everyday lives of people worldwide. The appeal of Web 2.0 applications and websites increases the vulnerability of the Web. Most Web 2.0 applications make use of AJAX, a group of web development programming tools used for creating interactive web applications or rich Internet applications. While users benefit from greater interactivity and more dynamic websites, they are also exposed to the greater security risks inherent in browser client processing.\nSection::::Examples.\nIn September 2008, malicious hackers broke into several sections of BusinessWeek.com to redirect visitors to malware-hosting websites. Hundreds of pages were compromised with malicious JavaScript pointing to third-party servers.\nIn August 2008, popular social networking sites were hit by a worm using social engineering techniques to get users to install a piece of malware. The worm installs comments on the sites with links to a fake site. If users follow the link, they are told they need to update their Flash Player. The installer then installs malware rather than the Flash Player. The malware then downloads a rogue anti-spyware application, AntiSpy Spider.\nIn May 2008, websites worldwide were compromised with a malicious JavaScript. Initially a half million websites worldwide were infected with a SQL injection which leveraged a ZLOB variant which then downloaded additional Trojan onto users\u2019 PCs. Then websites in China, Taiwan and Singapore were compromised followed shortly thereafter by humanitarian, government and news sites in the UK, Israel and Asia. In this attack the compromised websites led, through a variety of redirects, to the download of a Trojan.\nIn September 2017, visitors to TV network Showtime's website found that the website included Coinhive code that automatically began mining for Monero cryptocurrency without user consent. The Coinhive software was throttled to use only twenty percent of a visiting computer's CPU to avoid detection. Shortly after this discovery was publicized on social media, the Coinhive code was removed. Showtime declined to comment for multiple news articles. It's unknown if Showtime inserted this code into its website intentionally or if the addition of cryptomining code was the result of a website compromise. Coinhive offers code for websites that requires user consent prior to execution, but less than 2 percent of Coinhive implementations use this code. German researchers have defined cryptojacking as websites executing cryptomining on visiting users' computers without prior consent. With 1 out of every five hundred websites hosting a cryptomining script, cryptojacking is a persistent web threat."], "wikipedia-58437070": ["Issues of privacy emerge within this sphere of participatory surveillance, predominantly focused on how much information is available on the web that an individual does not consent to. More so, disease outbreak researchers can study social-media based patterns to decrease the time it takes to detect an outbreak, an emerging field of study called infodemiology. As digital technology advances with many dangers associated to privacy, individuals are attempting to be more accountable when meeting individuals. Background check websites and search engine sources reveal just how many people attempt to find information on another person, whatever the reason. Some researchers assert that by using these technologies of surveillance, the same ones used by companies to track consumer tendencies, the public is essentially feeding into practices of their own personal surveillance. Many researchers altogether ignore the idea of privacy when analyzing methods of participatory surveillance. More so, from a social media perspective, some researchers claim that by openly sharing information with others, this cannot be deemed a breach of privacy. However, a few researchers on the topic mention breaches of privacy within the spheres of both digital media studies and infodemiology.", "Section::::Privacy Concerns.:Doxing.\nDoxing is a form of cyberbullying, using the Internet to post private information about an individual or organization as a means of attack against the entity. Common information that can be leaked can be anything from a past discretion, home address, or even social security number of the victim. This information could be freely available on the Internet for the attacker to gain access to and make public. This differentiates it from other types of information leaks, since the information is simply being brought to the forefront of the public's viewing. In other words, the public information being leaked could be found freely by other parties even if it was not exposed in a more public light. The term \"doxing\" comes from the origins of document, first used in 2001 with the infamous hacker collective called Anonymous. With today's current laws, most legislation pertaining to cyber threats and attacks are rooted in the 1990s, when the Internet was just developing. Due to information being stored online, doxing does not adhere to standard rights of privacy. Constitutionally, individuals should have the right to disclose or not disclose information, while at the same time being able to make decisions about privacy. The Fourth Amendment protects the right to free speech, but doxing uniquely uses information available to the public, leading some 'doxers' to claim that they are simply exercising their Fourth Amendment rights.\nThe only exception to Fourth Amendment rights came about from \"Cohen v. California,\" which established the \"true threat\" exception. This exception established a breach of free speech rights whenever the content of the speech maliciously invades privacy interests. However, this exception may only work in some doxing situations, where the court measures the extent of the offense and the reactions from the attack.\nSection::::See also.\nBULLET::::- Infoveillance\nBULLET::::- Search engine privacy\nBULLET::::- Revenge porn\nBULLET::::- Swatting"], "wikipedia-31265421": ["The evolution between 2005 and 2011 of the level of disclosure for different profile items on Facebook shows that over the years, people want to keep more information private. Social networks have done the opposite: if we share more information, we expose more and Facebook can sell more to advertisers. Every 8 or 10 months, some social networks face privacy incidents which lead users to regroup and contest, however the networks usually apologize and continue on with the same information-mining tactics.\n\nWhen we share information with friends, their data are exposed and privacy decreases. This is a consequence of bridging social capital: as we create new and diverse ties on social networks, data becomes linked. This decrease of privacy continues until bundling appears (when the ties become strong and the network more homogenous). Privacy then increases through stagnation, creating a community where privacy can be reattained through mass. However, Facebook and other social media outlets find other ways for us to share information, for instance through games, top 10, quizz, etc. It makes what we can call \"cycles of privacy\".\n\nMethods can be purposely crafted to obtain one's personal information illegally. These directed attacks are commonly referred to as hacking, though that term refers to the general practice and doesn't address specific hacking methods and implementation. Various hacking methods as it pertains to the invasion of one's digital privacy are outlined below. As it pertains to intent, within hacking there", "are two categories of invasion: 1) Directed attacks against someone individually, and 2) Directed attacks against groups. With the latter category, however, a hacker could effectively obtain a specified/particular individual's information through first targeting a larger group. An example of this possibility could be as follows: If a hacker, named individual-A, wishes to obtain a particular person's information, individual-B, he/she could first target a platform or group that has individual-B's information already, such as a credit agency, or they could likewise target a group that individual-B has previously relinquished/provided their data to, like a social media network or a cloud based data service. Through targeting one of those groups, individual-A could effectively obtain individual-B's information by first hacking all data the group has, including the data of other individuals. Once obtained, the hacker could simply identify individual-B's information within the data and disregard the rest.\nSection::::Privacy and Information Breaches.:Example of an Individual Attack: Phishing.\nPhishing is a common method of obtaining someone's private information. This generally consists of an individual (often referred in this context as a hacker), developing a website that looks similar to other major websites that a target person commonly uses. The phishing website may look identical to the legitimate site, but its URL could be a variation in spelling or a different domain such as .org instead of .com. The target person can be directed to the site through a link in a 'fake' email that is designed to look like it came from the website he/she commonly uses. The user then clicks on the URL, proceeds to sign in, or provide other personal information, and as opposed to the information being submitted to the website that the user thought they were on, it is actually sent directly to the hacker. Phishing attacks commonly obtain bank and financial data as well as social networking website information.\nThere are tools that can help users protect their information from phishing attacks and these include the Web browser extensions, which are capable of flagging suspicious websites and links."], "wikipedia-1228060": ["Those concerned about Internet privacy often cite a number of \"privacy risks\" \u2014 events that can compromise privacy \u2014 which may be encountered through Internet use. These range from the gathering of statistics on users to more malicious acts such as the spreading of spyware and the exploitation of various forms of bugs (software faults).\n\nMoreover, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer potentially more intrusive details about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.\n\nAn HTTP cookie is data stored on a user's computer that assists in automated access to websites or web features, or other state information required in complex web sites. It may also be used for user-tracking by storing special usage history data in a cookie, and such cookies\u2014for example, those used by Google Analytics\u2014are called \"tracking cookies\". Cookies are a common concern in the field of Internet privacy. Although website developers most commonly use cookies for legitimate technical purposes, cases of abuse occur. In 2009, two researchers noted that social networking profiles could be connected to cookies, allowing the social networking profile to be connected to browsing habits.\n\nIn the past, web sites have not generally made the user explicitly aware of the storing of cookies, however tracking cookies and especially third-party tracking cookies are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories \u2014 a privacy concern that prompted European and US lawmakers to take action in 2011.", "BULLET::::- the placing of a personally-identifiable tag in a browser to facilitate Web profiling , or\nBULLET::::- use of cross-site scripting or other techniques to steal information from a user's cookies.\nCookies are mostly harmless except for third-party cookies. These cookies are not made by the website itself, but by web banner advertising companies. These third-party cookies are so dangerous because they take the same information that regular cookies do, such as browsing habits and frequently visited websites, but then they give out this information to other companies.\nThe process of \"profiling\" (also known as \"tracking\") assembles and analyzes several events, each attributable to a single originating entity, in order to gain information (especially patterns of activity) relating to the originating entity. Some organizations engage in the profiling of people's web browsing, collecting the URLs of sites visited. The resulting profiles can potentially link with information that personally identifies the individual who did the browsing.\nGovernments and organizations may set up honeypot websites \u2013 featuring controversial topics \u2013 with the purpose of attracting and tracking unwary people. This constitutes a potential danger for individuals.\nFlash cookies, also known as Local Shared Objects, work the same ways as normal cookies and are used by the Adobe Flash Player to store information at the user's computer. They exhibit a similar privacy risk as normal cookies, but are not as easily blocked, meaning that the option in most browsers to not accept cookies does not affect Flash cookies.\nEvercookies, created by Samy Kamkar, are JavaScript-based applications which produce cookies in a web browser that actively \"resist\" deletion by redundantly copying themselves in different forms on the user's machine (e.g., Flash Local Shared Objects, various HTML5 storage mechanisms, window.name caching, etc.), and resurrecting copies that are missing or expired.\nDevice fingerprinting is a fairly new technology that is useful in fraud prevention and safeguarding any information from one's computer. Device fingerprinting uses data from the device and browser sessions to determine the risk of conducting business with the person using the device.", "Section::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Device fingerprinting.:Sentinel Advanced Detection Analysis and Predator Tracking (A.D.A.P.T.).\nSentinel Advanced Detection Analysis and Predator Tracking (A.D.A.P.T.) is device fingerprinting software technology that identifies the device (computer, tablet, smartphone, ...) being used to access a website. This information, in turn, can be used to help differentiate legitimate users from those using false identities or those attempting to work anonymously. A.D.A.P.T. uses only HTTP and JavaScript to identify a device and identifies devices without requesting any personal information entered directly by the user. It makes an accurate \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the device by using many different pieces of information including, operating system, browser, and PC characteristics. A.D.A.P.T. is concealed in that the user of the device has no idea that the device is being \u201cfingerprinted\u201d and there is no actual tagging of the device.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Device fingerprinting.:Canvas fingerprinting.\nCanvas fingerprinting is one of a number of browser fingerprinting techniques of tracking online users that allow websites to uniquely identify and track visitors using HTML5 canvas element instead of browser cookies or other similar means.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Photographs on the Internet.\nToday many people have digital cameras and post their photographs online, for example street photography practitioners do so for artistic purposes and social documentary photography practitioners do so to document the common people in everyday life. The people depicted in these photos might not want to have them appear on the Internet. Police arrest photos, considered public record in many jurisdictions, are often posted on the internet by numerous online mug shot publishing sites.\nSome organizations attempt to respond to this privacy-related concern. For example, the 2005 Wikimania conference required that photographers have the prior permission of the people in their pictures, albeit this made it impossible for photographers to practice candid photography and doing the same in a public place would violate the photographers' free speech rights. Some people wore a \"no photos\" tag to indicate they would prefer not to have their photo taken .\nThe \"Harvard Law Review\" published a short piece called \"In The Face of Danger: Facial Recognition and Privacy Law\", much of it explaining how \"privacy law, in its current form, is of no help to those unwillingly tagged.\" Any individual can be unwillingly tagged in a photo and displayed in a manner that might violate them personally in some way, and by the time Facebook gets to taking down the photo, many people will have already had the chance to view, share, or distribute it. Furthermore, traditional tort law does not protect people who are captured by a photograph in public because this is not counted as an invasion of privacy. The extensive Facebook privacy policy covers these concerns and much more. For example, the policy states that they reserve the right to disclose member information or share photos with companies, lawyers, courts, government entities, etc. if they feel it absolutely necessary. The policy also informs users that profile pictures are mainly to help friends connect to each other. However, these, as well as other pictures, can allow other people to invade a person's privacy by finding out information that can be used to track and locate a certain individual. In an article featured in ABC News, it was stated that two teams of scientists found out that Hollywood stars could be giving up information about their private whereabouts very easily through pictures uploaded to the Internet. Moreover, it was found that pictures taken by some phones and tablets including iPhones automatically attach the latitude and longitude of the picture taken through metadata unless this function is manually disabled.\nFace recognition technology can be used to gain access to a person's private data, according to a new study. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University combined image scanning, cloud computing and public profiles from social network sites to identify individuals in the offline world. Data captured even included a user's social security number. Experts have warned of the privacy risks faced by the increased merging of our online and offline identities. The researchers have also developed an 'augmented reality' mobile app that can display personal data over a person's image captured on a smartphone screen. Since these technologies are widely available, our future identities may become exposed to anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. Researchers believe this could force us to reconsider our future attitudes to privacy.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Photographs on the Internet.:Google Street View.\nGoogle Street View, released in the U.S. in 2007, is currently the subject of an ongoing debate about possible infringement on individual privacy. In an article entitled \u201cPrivacy, Reconsidered: New Representations, Data Practices, and the Geoweb\u201d, Sarah Elwood and Agnieszka Leszczynski (2011) argue that Google Street View \u201cfacilitate[s] identification and disclosure with more immediacy and less abstraction.\u201d The medium through which Street View disseminates information, the photograph, is very immediate in the sense that it can potentially provide direct information and evidence about a person's whereabouts, activities, and private property. Moreover, the technology's disclosure of information about a person is less abstract in the sense that, if photographed, a person is represented on Street View in a virtual replication of his or her own real-life appearance. In other words, the technology removes abstractions of a person's appearance or that of his or her personal belongings \u2013 there is an immediate disclosure of the person and object, as they visually exist in real life. Although Street View began to blur license plates and people's faces in 2008, the technology is faulty and does not entirely ensure against accidental disclosure of identity and private property. Elwood and Leszczynski note that \u201cmany of the concerns leveled at Street View stem from situations where its photograph-like images were treated as definitive evidence of an individual\u2019s involvement in particular activities.\u201d In one instance, Ruedi Noser, a Swiss politician, barely avoided public scandal when he was photographed in 2009 on Google Street View walking with a woman who was not his wife \u2013 the woman was actually his secretary. Similar situations occur when Street View provides high-resolution photographs \u2013 and photographs hypothetically offer compelling objective evidence. But as the case of the Swiss politician illustrates, even supposedly compelling photographic evidence is sometimes subject to gross misinterpretation. This example further suggests that Google Street View may provide opportunities for privacy infringement and harassment through public dissemination of the photographs. Google Street View does, however, blur or remove photographs of individuals and private property from image frames if the individuals request further blurring and/or removal of the images. This request can be submitted, for review, through the \u201creport a problem\u201d button that is located on the bottom left-hand side of every image window on Google Street View, however, Google has made attempts to report a problem difficult by disabling the \"Why are you reporting the street view\" icon.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Search engines.\nSearch engines have the ability to track a user's searches. Personal information can be revealed through searches by the user's computer, account, or IP address being linked to the search terms used. Search engines have claimed a necessity to retain such information in order to provide better services, protect against security pressure, and protect against fraud.\nA search engine takes all of its users and assigns each one a specific ID number. Those in control of the database often keep records of where on the Internet each member has traveled to. AOL's system is one example. AOL has a database 21 million members deep, each with their own specific ID number. The way that AOLSearch is set up, however, allows for AOL to keep records of all the websites visited by any given member. Even though the true identity of the user isn't known, a full profile of a member can be made just by using the information stored by AOLSearch. By keeping records of what people query through AOLSearch, the company is able to learn a great deal about them without knowing their names.\nSearch engines also are able to retain user information, such as location and time spent using the search engine, for up to ninety days. Most search engine operators use the data to get a sense of which needs must be met in certain areas of their field. People working in the legal field are also allowed to use information collected from these search engine websites. The Google search engine is given as an example of a search engine that retains the information entered for a period of three-fourths of a year before it becomes obsolete for public usage. Yahoo! follows in the footsteps of Google in the sense that it also deletes user information after a period of ninety days. Other search engines such as Ask! search engine has promoted a tool of \"AskEraser\" which essentially takes away personal information when requested.\nSome changes made to Internet search engines included that of Google's search engine. Beginning in 2009, Google began to run a new system where the Google search became personalized. The item that is searched and the results that are shown remembers previous information that pertains to the individual. Google search engine not only seeks what is searched, but also strives to allow the user to feel like the search engine recognizes their interests. This is achieved by using online advertising. A system that Google uses to filter advertisements and search results that might interest the user is by having a ranking system that tests relevancy that include observation of the behavior users exude while searching on Google. Another function of search engines is the predictability of location. Search engines are able to predict where one's location is currently by locating IP Addresses and geographical locations.", "Section::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Privacy issues of social networking sites.\nThe advent of the Web 2.0 has caused social profiling and is a growing concern for Internet privacy. Web 2.0 is the system that facilitates participatory information sharing and collaboration on the Internet, in social networking media websites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and MySpace. These social networking sites have seen a boom in their popularity starting from the late 2000s. Through these websites many people are giving their personal information out on the internet.\nIt has been a topic of discussion of who is held accountable for the collection and distribution of personal information. Some will say that it is the fault of the social networks because they are the ones who are storing the vast amounts of information and data, but others claim that it is the users who are responsible for the issue because it is the users themselves that provide the information in the first place. This relates to the ever-present issue of how society regards social media sites. There is a growing number of people that are discovering the risks of putting their personal information online and trusting a website to keep it private. Yet in a recent study, researchers found that young people are taking measures to keep their posted information on Facebook private to some degree. Examples of such actions include managing their privacy settings so that certain content can be visible to \"Only Friends\" and ignoring Facebook friend requests from strangers.\nIn 2013 a class action lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user messages for web links, translating them to \u201clikes\u201d on the user's Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. \"\"Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA also referred to as the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code,\"\" the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open. This is becoming a bigger issue now that so much of society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago. In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and it is important to consider that when interacting online. New forms of social networking and digital media such as Instagram and Snapchat may call for new guidelines regarding privacy. What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances.", "Section::::Risks to Internet privacy.:HTML5.\nHTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language specification. HTML defines how user agents, such as web browsers, are to present websites based upon their underlying code. This new web standard changes the way that users are affected by the internet and their privacy on the internet. HTML5 expands the number of methods given to a website to store information locally on a client as well as the amount of data that can be stored. As such, privacy risks are increased. For instance, merely erasing cookies may not be enough to remove potential tracking methods since data could be mirrored in web storage, another means of keeping information in a user's web browser. There are so many sources of data storage that it is challenging for web browsers to present sensible privacy settings. As the power of web standards increases, so do potential misuses.\nHTML5 also expands access to user media, potentially granting access to a computer's microphone or webcam, a capability previously only possible through the use of plug-ins like Flash. It is also possible to find a user's geographical location using the geolocation API. With this expanded access comes increased potential for abuse as well as more vectors for attackers. If a malicious site was able to gain access to a user's media, it could potentially use recordings to uncover sensitive information thought to be unexposed. However, the World Wide Web Consortium, responsible for many web standards, feels that the increased capabilities of the web platform outweigh potential privacy concerns. They state that by documenting new capabilities in an open standardization process, rather than through closed source plug-ins made by companies, it is easier to spot flaws in specifications and cultivate expert advice.\nBesides elevating privacy concerns, HTML5 also adds a few tools to enhance user privacy. A mechanism is defined whereby user agents can share blacklists of domains that should not be allowed to access web storage. Content Security Policy is a proposed standard whereby sites may assign privileges to different domains, enforcing harsh limitations on JavaScript use to mitigate cross-site scripting attacks. HTML5 also adds HTML templating and a standard HTML parser which replaces the various parsers of web browser vendors. These new features formalize previously inconsistent implementations, reducing the number of vulnerabilities though not eliminating them entirely.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Big Data.\nBig Data is generally defined as the rapid accumulation and compiling of massive amounts of information that is being exchanged over digital communication systems. The data is large (often exceeding exabytes) and cannot be handled by conventional computer processors, and are instead stored on large server-system databases. This information is assessed by analytic scientists using software programs; which paraphrase this information into multi-layered user trends and demographics. This information is collected from all around the Internet, such as by popular services like Facebook, Google, Apple, Spotify or GPS systems. \nBig Data provides companies with the ability to:\nBULLET::::- Infer detailed psycho-demographic profiles of internet users, even if they were not directly expressed or indicated by users.\nBULLET::::- Inspect product availability and optimize prices for maximum profit while clearing inventory.\nBULLET::::- Swiftly reconfigure risk portfolios in minutes and understand future opportunities to mitigate risk.\nBULLET::::- Mine customer data for insight, and create advertising strategies for customer acquisition and retention.\nBULLET::::- Identify customers who matter the most.\nBULLET::::- Create retail coupons based on a proportional scale to how much the customer has spent, to ensure a higher redemption rate.\nBULLET::::- Send tailored recommendations to mobile devices at just the right time, while customers are in the right location to take advantage of offers.\nBULLET::::- Analyze data from social media to detect new market trends and changes in demand.\nBULLET::::- Use clickstream analysis and data mining to detect fraudulent behavior.\nBULLET::::- Determine root causes of failures, issues and defects by investigating user sessions, network logs and machine sensors.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Other potential Internet privacy risks.\nBULLET::::- Malware is a term short for \"malicious software\" and is used to describe software to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network whether that is through the use of a virus, trojan horse, spyware, etc.\nBULLET::::- Spyware is a piece of software that obtains information from a user's computer without that user's consent.\nBULLET::::- A web bug is an object embedded into a web page or email and is usually invisible to the user of the website or reader of the email.

It is enabled by default in major browsers such as Firefox and Google Chrome.", "Section::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Noise Society \u2013 Protection through Information Overflow.\nAccording to Nicklas Lundblad, another perspective on privacy protection is the assumption that the quickly growing amount of information produced will be beneficial. The reasons for this are that the costs for the surveillance will raise and that there is more noise, noise being understood as anything that interferes the process of a receiver trying to extract private data from a sender.\nIn this noise society, the collective expectation of privacy will increase, but the individual expectation of privacy will decrease. In other words, not everyone can be analyzed in detail, but one individual can be. Also, in order to stay unobserved, it can hence be better to blend in with the others than trying to use for example encryption technologies and similar methods. Technologies for this can be called Jante-technologies after the Law of Jante, which states that you are nobody special.\nThis view offers new challenges and perspectives for the privacy discussion.\nSection::::Public views.:Concerns of Internet privacy and real life implications.\nWhile dealing with the issue of internet privacy, one must first be concerned with not only the technological implications such as damaged property, corrupted files, and the like, but also with the potential for implications on their real lives. One such implication, which is rather commonly viewed as being one of the most daunting fears risks of the Internet, is the potential for identity theft. Although it is a typical belief that larger companies and enterprises are the usual focus of identity thefts, rather than individuals, recent reports seem to show a trend opposing this belief. Specifically, it was found in a 2007 \u201cInternet Security Threat Report\u201d that roughly ninety-three percent of \u201cgateway\u201d attacks were targeted at unprepared home users. The term \u201cgateway\u201d attack was used to refer to attack which aimed not at stealing data immediately, but rather at gaining access for future attacks.\nBut how, one might ask, is this still thriving given the increasing emphasis on internet security? The simple, but unfortunate solution, according to Symantec's \u201cInternet Security Threat Report\u201d, is that of the expanding \u201cunderground economy\u201d. With more than fifty percent of the supporting servers located in the United States, this \u201cunderground economy\u201d has become a haven for internet thieves, who use the system in order to sell stolen information. These pieces of information can range from generic things such as a user account or email to something as personal as a bank account number and PIN.\nWhile the processes these internet thieves use are abundant and unique, one popular trap unsuspecting people fall into is that of online purchasing. This is not to allude to the idea that every purchase one makes online will leave them susceptible to identity theft, but rather that it increases the chances. In fact, in a 2001 article titled \u201cConsumer Watch\u201d, the popular online site PC World went as far as calling secure e-shopping a myth. Though unlike the \u201cgateway\u201d attacks mentioned above, these incidents of information being stolen through online purchases generally are more prevalent in medium to large sized e-commerce sites, rather than smaller individualized sites. This is assumed to be a result of the larger consumer population and purchases, which allow for more potential leeway with information.\nUltimately, however, the potential for a violation of one's privacy is typically out of their hands after purchasing from an online \u201ce-tailer\u201d or store. One of the most common forms in which hackers receive private information from online \u201ce-tailers\u201d actually comes from an attack placed upon the site's servers responsible for maintaining information about previous transactions. For as experts explain, these \u201ce-tailers\u201d are not doing nearly enough to maintain or improve their security measures. Even those sites that clearly present a privacy or security policy can be subject to hackers\u2019 havoc as most policies only rely upon encryption technology which only applies to the actual transfer of a customer's data. However, with this being said, most \u201ce-tailers\u201d have been making improvements, going as far as covering some of the credit card fees if the information's abuse can be traced back to the site's servers.\nAs one of the largest growing concerns American adults have of current Internet privacy policies, identity and credit theft remain a constant figure in the debate surrounding privacy online. A 1997 study by the Boston Consulting Group showed that participants of the study were most concerned about their privacy on the Internet compared to any other media. However, it is important to recall that these issues are not the only prevalent concerns our society has. Though some may call it a modern-day version of McCarthyism, another prevalent issue also remains members of our own society sending disconcerting emails to one another. It is for this reason in 2001 that for one of the first times ever the public demonstrated an approval of government intervention in their private lives.\nWith the overall public anxiety regarding the constantly expanding trend of online crimes, in 2001 roughly fifty-four percent of Americans polled showed a general approval for the FBI monitoring those emails deemed suspicious. Thus, it was born the idea for the FBI program: \u201cCarnivore\u201d, which was going to be used as a searching method, allowing the FBI to hopefully home in on potential criminals. Unlike the overall approval of the FBI's intervention, \u201cCarnivore\u201d was not met with as much of a majority's approval. Rather, the public seemed to be divided with forty-five percent siding in its favor, forty-five percent opposed to the idea for its ability to potentially interfere with ordinary citizen's messages, and ten percent claiming indifference. While this may seem slightly tangent to the topic of internet privacy, it is important to consider that at the time of this poll, the general population's approval on government actions was declining, reaching thirty-one percent versus the forty-one percent it held a decade prior. This figure in collaboration with the majority's approval of FBI intervention demonstrates an emerging emphasis on the issue of internet privacy in society and more importantly, the potential implications it may hold on citizens\u2019 lives.\nOnline users must seek to protect the information they share with online websites, specifically social media. In today's Web 2.0 individuals have become the public producers of personal information. We create our own digital trails that hackers and companies alike capture and utilize for a variety of marketing and advertisement targeting. A recent paper from the Rand Corporation claims \"privacy is not the opposite of sharing \u2013 rather, it is control over sharing.\" Internet privacy concerns arise from our surrender of personal information to engage in a variety of acts, from transactions to commenting in online forums. Protections against invasions of online privacy will require individuals to make an effort informing and protecting themselves via existing software solutions, to pay premiums for such protections or require individuals to place greater pressure on governing institutions to enforce privacy laws and regulations regarding consumer and personal information.", "BULLET::::- The FBI's Magic Lantern software program was the topic of much debate when it was publicized in November 2001. Magic Lantern is a Trojan Horse program that logs users' keystrokes, rendering encryption useless to those infected.\nSection::::Children and Internet Privacy.\nInternet privacy is a growing concern with children and the content they are able to view. Aside from that, many concerns for the privacy of email, the vulnerability of internet users to have their internet usage tracked, and the collection of personal information also exist. These concerns have begun to bring the issues of internet privacy before the courts and judges."], "wikipedia-8223796": ["Section::::Information security.:Phishing.\nPhishing is a type of scam where the scammers disguise as a trustworthy source in attempt to obtain private information such as passwords, and credit card information, etc. through the internet. These fake websites are often designed to look identical to their legitimate counterparts to avoid suspicion from the user.\nSection::::Information security.:Internet scams.\nInternet scams are schemes that deceive the user in various ways in attempt to take advantage of them. Internet scams often aim to cheat the victim of personal property directly rather than personal information through false promises, confidence tricks and more.\nSection::::Information security.:Malware.\nMalware, particularly spyware, is malicious software disguised as software designed to collect and transmit private information, such as password, without the user's consent or knowledge. They are often distributed through e-mail, software and files from unofficial locations. Malware is one of the most prevalent security concerns as often it is impossible to determine whether a file is infected, despite the source of the file.\nSection::::Personal safety.:Cyberstalking.\nCyberstalking is the use of the Internet or other electronic means to stalk or harass an individual, group, or organization. It may include false accusations, defamation, slander and libel. It may also include monitoring, identity theft, threats, vandalism, solicitation for sex, or gathering information that may be used to threaten, embarrass or harass.\nSection::::Personal safety.:Cyberbullying.\nCyberbullying is the use of electronic means such as instant messaging, social media, e-mail and other forms of online communication with the intent to abuse, intimidate, or overpower an individual or group. In a 2012 study of over 11,925 students in the United States, it was indicated that 23% of adolescents reported being a victim of cyber bullying, 30% of which reported experiencing suicidal behavior.\nSection::::Personal safety.:Online predation.\nOnline predation is the act of engaging an underage minor into inappropriate sexual relationships through the internet. Online predators may attempt to initiate and seduce minors into relationships through the use of chat rooms or internet forums. In a sample of 216 incarcerated sexual offenders, the behavior characteristics that emerged were categorized into three groups: A) manipulative - typically a child molester; B) Opportunist - typically a rapist and C) Coercive being a mixture of both rapists and child molesters. \nSection::::Personal safety.:Obscene/offensive content.\nVarious websites on the internet contain material that some deem offensive, distasteful or explicit, which may often be not of the user's liking. Such websites may include internet, shock sites, hate spee..."], "wikipedia-2041117": ["Privacy concerns with social networking services have been raised growing concerns among users on the dangers of giving out too much personal information and the threat of sexual predators. Users of these services also need to be aware of data theft or viruses. However, large services, such as Myspace and Netlog, often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents. In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken. Furthermore, there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may, in fact, be retained and passed to third parties. This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site Quechup harvested e-mail addresses from users' e-mail accounts for use in a spamming operation.", "The debate questions to what extent the design of these systems is compromising the needs, privacy and information of the users. More research is needed to evaluate if allowing advertising to access user information to specifically tailor content to their choices and interactions, for example by placing ads within their personal feeds and throughout their use of the site, is compromising the user's information and social wellbeing. John Herrman (2018) compares the function of algorithms in adjusting content to omniscience and recounts the unpleasant experiences that coincide as a result. He calls to web browsing on Amazon, where products he browsed through briefly reappear on other news feeds, including his Instagram feed. He outlines the experience as if the networks \u201c[have] got eyes everywhere,\u201d and suggests that this looming omniscience may alter how we interact online, even \u201crisk driving away followers in the process.\u201d This may deter users from engaging in social interactions online and points to how much advertisers are able to tailor information to their intended audience. This debate was further ignited in early 2018. On April 10, 2018, Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress on questions defining Facebook's policy, information handling and data design systems. Congress placed emphasis on addressing Facebook's tracking of user data online, skeptical that the social networking site can regulate itself.\nSection::::Issues.:Data mining.\nThrough data mining, companies are able to improve their sales and profitability. With this data, companies create customer profiles that contain customer demographics and online behavior. A recent strategy has been the purchase and production of \"network analysis software\". This software is able to sort out through the influx of social networking data for any specific company. Facebook has been especially important to marketing strategists. Facebook's controversial \"Social Ads\" program gives companies access to the millions of profiles in order to tailor their ads to a Facebook user's own interests and hobbies. However, rather than sell actual user information, Facebook sells tracked \"social actions\". That is, they track the websites a user uses outside of Facebook through a program called Facebook Beacon.\nSection::::Issues.:Unauthorized access.\nThere are different forms where user data in social networks are accessed and updated without a user's permission. One study highlighted that the most common incidents included inappropriate comments posted on social networking sites (43%), messages sent to contacts that were never authored (25%) and change of personal details (24%). The most incidents are carried out by the victim's friends (36%) or partners (21%) and one in ten victims say their ex-partner has logged into their account without prior consent. The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011.", "Section::::Issues.:Virtual identity suicide.\nThere is a growing number of social network users who decide to quit their user account by committing a so-called virtual identity suicide or Web 2.0 suicide. A 2013 study in the journal \"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking\" investigated this phenomenon from the perspective of Facebook users. The number one reason for these users was privacy concerns (48%), being followed by a general dissatisfaction with the social networking website (14%), negative aspects regarding social network friends (13%) and the feeling of getting addicted to the social networking website (6%). Facebook quitters were found to be more concerned about privacy, more addicted to the Internet and more conscientious.\nSection::::Issues.:Breaking up.\nSites such as Facebook are becoming increasingly popular tools for methods of ending relationships and friendships, proving that although new media is being used as a tool for connecting with individuals, it is now creating new problems associated with disconnecting from others. Instead of the traditional phone call or face-to-face interaction between individuals, people are now starting to end relationships by simply changing their relationship status, knowing full well that their partner will soon see it. The problem with that is that you are left with no closure and the entire online world now knows you are no longer in a relationship. In a 2010 study conducted online, nearly one-quarter of the 1,000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on Facebook. New media websites have made our private lives much more public, especially when it comes to breaking up, since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks (which tend to be more people than we would normally tell personally); for example, having friends comment on your newly changed \"single\" relationship status, and having to explain what happened can be distressing.\nThis creates further problems, as it is even more crucial to 'save face' after one's relationship has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies. Erving Goffman argues that all social life boils down to face-to-face interactions. These interpersonal interactions are mediated by what Goffman terms as \"face-work\", which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with one's face and to uphold the expressive order of social situations. Individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others, and in order to do so, they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way. Such face-work can also be seen in new technologies, especially social media websites such as Facebook. If someone breaks up with you, you can actively choose what \"face\" you want to present to your friends, including your ex. You can choose to either post sad updates, which is the most natural thing you would want to do, or you can \"save face\" by posting happy updates and pictures of you going out with your friends. Even though you may be absolutely heartbroken within, Facebook allows you to hide your true feelings from the online world, and from your ex, by manipulating your profile. New media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves, enabling them to save face in difficult situations. Nearly 35% of respondents in a study admitted to using their Facebook status to make someone think that they had plans, even if they did not.\nMany people find that the only way to really move on from a past relationship is to cut the person out of their life completely. Social media has made this process much more complicated and difficult. In a 2012 study, 48% of the participants stated they had remained friends with their ex on Facebook, and of these people, 88% stated they 'creeped' their ex after the breakup. Many digital social networking sites leave behind a trail of a user's interactions, so deleting content may be an arduous process, more difficult than simply burning or throwing away an entire box of letters, photos, and mementos. Additionally, this content can still remain online.\nSection::::Issues.:Social overload.\nThe increasing number of messages and social relationships embedded in SNS also increases the amount of social information demanding a reaction from SNS users. Consequently, SNS users perceive they are giving too much social support to other SNS friends. This dark side of SNS usage is called 'social overload'. It is caused by the extent of usage, number of friends, subjective social support norms, and type of relationship (online-only vs offline friends) while age has only an indirect effect. The psychological and behavioral consequences of social overload include perceptions of SNS exhaustion, low user satisfaction, and high intentions to reduce or stop using SNS.\nSection::::Issues.:Social anxiety.\nSmartphones and social networking services enable us to stay connected continuously with people around us or far away from us, which however is sometimes the root of our anxiety in social life. The eager to know what everyone was saying and the tendency to see if anyone shared new things are typical \"symptoms\" of this anxiety called FoMO. There is a study that examined possible connections between FOMO and social media engagement indicating that FoMO was associated with lower need satisfaction, mood and life satisfaction.\nAnother type of social anxiety is the FoBM (fear of being missed). It comes from the situation that we can't produce share-content for people to consume. The FoBM is a counterpart of FoMO; however, compared to FoMO it may have a more serious impact since the exclusion from the conversation can result in continuous exclusion later.\nSection::::Issues.:Effects on personal relationships and social capital.\nThe number of contacts on a social platform is sometimes considered an indicator of social capital. However, studies show it is rather an indicator of low self-esteem and of a form of social compensation. Indeed, people tend to add friends to compensate low self-esteem and there is a high correlation between the number of \"friends\" on social media platforms and feeling social anxiety, leading to symptoms of major depression and dysthymia. If we consider this aspect with regards to the relationships maintained through social media platforms, we can easily point out a change in our understanding of friendship. As a matter of fact, online platforms and social media services altered the old definition of friendship. Indeed, friendship \"redoubleth joys, and cutteth griefs in halves\" as stated by Francis Bacon. However, nowadays we see that Facebook friends, for instance, encourage negative feelings, such as envy, revenge and sadness.\nWhen it comes to friendship, we can wonder whether friendship on online platforms is a real form of friendship, or it is just a sort of metaphor to compensate for social communication problems. Actually, a lot of changes can be spotted in its old definition compared to the one in the era of social media. Friendship used to relate to the public sphere as explained in \"Nicomachean Ethics\", however nowadays friendship is rather exposed publicly on different social media platforms. \nMoreover, a study shows that Facebook users know only a bit more than two thirds of their \"friends\" on the platform, meaning that they did not know one-third of the individuals in their friend-lists. This raises security and privacy issues and the project researchers alerted participants that they would better unfriend people they did not recognize."], "wikipedia-16260775": ["Fraud and impersonation are some of the malicious activities that occur due to the direct or indirect abuse of private information. Identity theft is rising rapidly due to the availability of private information in the internet. For instance, seven million Americans fell victim to identity theft in 2002, and nearly 12 million Americans were victims of identity theft in 2011 making it the fastest growing crime in the United States.\nPublic records search engines and databases are the main culprits contributing to the rise of cybercrime.\n\nData warehouses are used today to collect and store huge amounts of personal data and consumer transactions. These facilities can preserve large volumes of consumer information for an indefinite amount of time. Some of the key architectures contributing to the erosion of privacy include databases, cookies and spyware.\n\nSome may argue that data warehouses are supposed to stand alone and be protected. However, the fact is enough personal information can be gathered from corporate websites and social networking sites to initiate a reverse lookup. Therefore, is it not important to address some of the ethical issues regarding how protected data ends up in the public domain?\n\nAs a result, identity theft protection businesses are on the rise. Companies such as LifeLock and JPMorgan Chase have begun to capitalize on selling identity theft protection insurance."], "wikipedia-48736239": ["Regarding privacy concerns with the technology corporation Google, Google's privacy change (March 1, 2012) enables the company to share data across a wide variety of services. These embedded services include millions of third-party websites that use Adsense and Analytics. The policy was widely criticized for creating an environment that discourages Internet-innovation by making Internet users more fearful and wary of what they put online.\n\nPrivacy International has raised concerns regarding the dangers and privacy implications of having a centrally located, widely popular data warehouse of millions of Internet users' searches, and how under controversial existing U.S. law, Google can be forced to hand over all such information to the U.S. government.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, Google quietly dropped its ban on personally-identifiable info in its DoubleClick ad service. Google's privacy policy was changed to state it \"may\" combine web-browsing records obtained through DoubleClick with what the company learns from the use of other Google services.\n\nGoogle places one or more cookies on each user's computer, which is used to track a person's web browsing on a large number of unrelated websites, and track their search history. If you are logged into a Google service, Google also uses the cookies to record which Google Account is accessing each website and doing each search.\n\nGoogle is suspected of collecting and aggregating data about Internet users through the various tools it provides to developers, such as Google Analytics, Google Play Services, reCAPTCHA, Google Fonts, and Google APIs. This could enable Google to determine a user's route through the Internet by tracking the IP address being used through successive sites (cross-domain web tracking).\n\nReCAPTCHA uses the google.com domain instead of one specific to ReCAPTCHA. This allows Google to receive any cookies that they have already set for you, effectively bypassing restrictions on setting third party cookies and allowing traffic correlation with all of Google\u2019s other services, which most users use. ReCAPTCHA collects enough information that it could reliably de-anonymize many users that simply wish to prove that they are Not A Robot.\n\nIn 2004, thirty-one privacy and civil liberties organizations wrote a letter calling upon Google to suspend its Gmail service until the privacy issues were adequately addressed. The letter also called upon Google to clarify its written information policies regarding data retention and data sharing among its business units. The organizations voiced their concerns about Google's plan to scan the text of all incoming messages for the purposes of ad placement, noting that the scanning of confidential email for inserting third party ad content violates the implicit trust of an email service provider.", "In February 2010, Google was reported to be working on an agreement with the National Security Agency (NSA) to investigate recent attacks against its network. And, while the deal did not give NSA access to Google's data on users' searches or e-mail communications and accounts and Google was not sharing proprietary data with the agency, privacy and civil rights advocates were concerned.\n\nIn October 2004, Google acquired Keyhole, a 3D mapping company. In February 2004, before its acquisition by Google, Keyhole received an investment from In-Q-Tel, the CIA's investment arm. And in July 2010 it was reported that the investment arms of both the CIA (In-Q-Tel) and Google (Google Ventures) were investing in Recorded Future, a company specializing in predictive analytics\u2014monitoring the web in real time and using that information to predict the future. And, while private corporations have been using similar systems since the 1990s, the involvement of Google and the CIA with their large data stores raised privacy concerns.\n\nLeaked NSA documents obtained by \"The Guardian\" and \"The Washington Post\" in June 2013 included Google on the list of companies that cooperate with the NSA's PRISM surveillance program, which authorizes the government to secretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Following the leak, government officials acknowledged the existence of the program. According to the leaked documents, the NSA has direct access to servers of those companies, and the amount of data collected through the program had been growing fast in years prior to the leak. Google has denied the existence of any \"government backdoor\".\n\nGoogle has been criticized both for disclosing too much information to governments too quickly and for not disclosing information that governments need to enforce their laws. In 2008, Consumer Watchdog produced a video showing how Google Chrome records what a user types into the web address field and sends that information to Google servers to populate search suggestions. The video includes discussion regarding the potential privacy implications of this feature.\n\nGoogle Chrome includes a private browsing feature called \"incognito browsing mode\" that prevents the browser from permanently storing any browsing or download history information or cookies. Using incognito mode prevents tracking by the browser. However, the individual websites visited can still track and store information about visits. In particular any searches performed while signed into a Google account will be saved as part of the account's web history. In addition, other programs such as those used to stream media files, which are invoked from within Chrome, may still record history information, even when incognito mode is being used. Furthermore, a limitation of Apple's iOS 7 platform allows some information from incognito browser windows to leak to regular Chrome browser windows. There are concerns that these limitations may have led Chrome users to believe that incognito mode provides more privacy protection than it actually does.\n\nGoogle's online map service, \"Street View\", has been accused of taking pictures and viewing too far into people's private homes and/or too close to people on the street when they do not know they are being photographed.\n\nDuring 2006\u201310, Google Streetview camera cars collected about 600 gigabytes of data from users of unencrypted public and private Wi-Fi networks in more than 30 countries. No disclosures nor privacy policy was given to those affected, nor to the owners of the Wi-Fi stations.\n\nOn February 9, 2010, Google launched Google Buzz, Google's microblogging service. Anyone with a Gmail account was automatically added as a contact to pre-existing Gmail contacts, and had to opt out if they did not wish to participate.\n\nThe launch of Google Buzz as an \"opt-out\" social network immediately drew criticism for violating user privacy because it automatically allowed Gmail users' contacts to view their other contacts. In 2011, the United States Federal Trade Commission initiated a Commission proceeding against respondent Google, Inc., alleging that certain personal information of Gmail users was shared without consumers' permission through the Google Buzz social network.\n\nGoogle Plus (G+) was launched in late June 2011. The new service gained 20 million members in just a few weeks. At the time of launch, the site's user content and conduct policy stated, \"To help fight spam and prevent fake profiles, use the name your friends, family or co-workers usually call you.\" Starting in July 2011, Google began enforcing this policy by suspending the accounts of those who used pseudonyms. Starting in August 2011, Google provided a four-day grace period before enforcing the real name policy and suspending accounts. The four days allowed members time to change their pen name to their real name. The policy extends to new accounts for all of Google services, including Gmail and YouTube, although accounts existing before the new policy are not required to be updated. In late January 2012 Google began allowing members to use nicknames, maiden names, and other \"established\" names in addition to their common or real names.", "In early 2005, the United States Department of Justice filed a motion in federal court to force Google to comply with a subpoena for \"the text of each search string entered onto Google's search engine over a two-month period (absent any information identifying the person who entered such query).\" Google fought the subpoena, due to concerns about users' privacy. In March 2006, the court ruled partially in Google's favor, recognizing the privacy implications of turning over search terms and refusing to grant access.\nIn April 2008, a Pittsburgh couple, Aaron and Christine Boring, sued Google for \"invasion of privacy\". They claimed that Street View made a photo of their home available online, and it diminished the value of their house, which was purchased for its privacy. They lost their case in a Pennsylvania court. \"While it is easy to imagine that many whose property appears on Google's virtual maps resent the privacy implications, it is hard to believe that any other than the most exquisitely sensitive would suffer shame or humiliation,\" Judge Hay ruled; the Boring family was paid one dollar by Google for the incident.\nIn May 2010, a U.S. District Court in Portland, Oregon ordered Google to hand over two copies of wireless data that the company's Street View program collected as it photographed neighborhoods.\nIn 2012 and 2013, Google reached two settlements over tracking consumers online without their knowledge after bypassing privacy settings in Apple\u2019s Safari browser. The first was settlement in August 2012 for $22.5 million with the Federal Trade Commission\u2014the largest civil penalty the F.T.C. has ever obtained for a violation of a Commission order. The second was a November 2013 settlement for $17 million with 37 states and the District of Columbia. In addition to the fines, Google agreed to avoid using software that overrides a browser's cookie-blocking settings, to avoid omitting or misrepresenting information to consumers about how they use Google products or control the ads they see, to maintain for five years a web page explaining what cookies are and how to control them, and to ensure that the cookies tied to Safari browsers expire. In both settlements Google denied any wrongdoing, but said it discontinued circumventing the settings early in 2012, after the practice was publicly reported, and stopped tracking Safari users and showing them personalized ads.\nIn the summer of 2016, Google quietly dropped its ban on personally-identifiable info in its DoubleClick ad service. Google's privacy policy was changed to state it \"may\" combine web-browsing records obtained through DoubleClick with what the company learns from the use of other Google services. While new users were automatically opted-in, existing users were asked if they wanted to opt-in, and it remains possible to opt-out by going to the Activity controls in the My Account page of a Google account. \"ProPublica\" states that \"The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct.\" Google contacted \"ProPublica\" to correct the fact that it doesn't \"currently\" use Gmail keywords to target web ads."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

With a cookie identifying the user's browser, a third party domain can track the user activity across websites using redirection techniques or providing a free service that makes cross-domain tracking possible, such as the Facebook `Like' button or social media sharing plugins for WordPress. Then, by analyzing the content of the browsed websites, the tracking domain can effortlessly -- and at an unprecedented scale -- derive users' intentions and interests, alongside with other sensitive profiling information. There is a plethora of work that capitalize on user profiling based on how we browse. For example, our browsing history is used to detect targeted ads or even identify which attribute or user action triggered a specific ad. Olejnik et al. noticed that, with just 4 visited websites, it is possible to uniquely identify users in 97% of cases. At the same time, Web users are concerned about third-party tracking, especially about location access and inferring demographics. Today, advancements in web advertising provide new opportunities to trackers and advertisers to extend their visibility.

Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.\n\nIn 2014, Kyunghyun Cho et al. put forward a simplified variant called Gated recurrent unit (GRU).\n\nFor example, gated recurrent units (GRUs) do not have an output gate."], "wikipedia-1706303": ["Both finite impulse and infinite impulse recurrent networks can have additional stored state, and the storage can be under direct control by the neural network. The storage can also be replaced by another network or graph, if that incorporates time delays or has feedback loops. Such controlled states are referred to as gated state or gated memory, and are part of long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units.\n\nLong short-term memory (LSTM) networks were discovered by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997 and set accuracy records in multiple applications domains.\n\nAround 2007, LSTM started to revolutionize speech recognition, outperforming traditional models in certain speech applications.

Since the LSTM Turing machine is a neural network, it can develop novel learning algorithms by learning on learning problems. It turns out that the learned new learning techniques are superior to those designed by humans.

This means that while the predictions of a single tree are highly sensitive to noise in its training set, the average of many trees is not, as long as the trees are not correlated. Simply training many trees on a single training set would give strongly correlated trees (or even the same tree many times, if the training algorithm is deterministic); bootstrap sampling is a way of de-correlating the trees by showing them different training sets.\n\nThe above procedure describes the original bagging algorithm for trees. Random forests differ in only one way from this general scheme: they use a modified tree learning algorithm that selects, at each candidate split in the learning process, a random subset of the features. This process is sometimes called \"feature bagging\". The reason for doing this is the correlation of the trees in an ordinary bootstrap sample: if one or a few features are very strong predictors for the response variable (target output), these features will be selected in many of the trees, causing them to become correlated."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

So, in this case, precision is \"how useful the search results are\", and recall is \"how complete the results are\".\n\nIn simple terms, high precision means that an algorithm returned substantially more relevant results than irrelevant ones, while high recall means that an algorithm returned most of the relevant results.\n\nIn a classification task, the precision for a class is the \"number of true positives\" (i.e. the number of items correctly labeled as belonging to the positive class) \"divided by the total number of elements labeled as belonging to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false positives, which are items incorrectly labeled as belonging to the class). Recall in this context is defined as the \"number of true positives divided by the total number of elements that actually belong to the positive class\" (i.e. the sum of true positives and false negatives, which are items which were not labeled as belonging to the positive class but should have been).\n\nIn information retrieval, a perfect precision score of 1.0 means that every result retrieved by a search was relevant (but says nothing about whether all relevant documents were retrieved) whereas a perfect recall score of 1.0 means that all relevant documents were retrieved by the search (but says nothing about how many irrelevant documents were also retrieved).\n\nIn a classification task, a precision score of 1.0 for a class C means that every item labeled as belonging to class C does indeed belong to class C (but says nothing about the number of items from class C that were not labeled correctly) whereas a recall of 1.0 means that every item from class C was labeled as belonging to class C (but says nothing about how many other items were incorrectly also labeled as belonging to class C).\n\nExamples of measures that are a combination of precision and recall are the F-measure (the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall), or the Matthews correlation coefficient, which is a geometric mean of the chance-corrected variants: the regression coefficients Informedness (DeltaP') and Markedness (DeltaP). Accuracy is a weighted arithmetic mean of Precision and Inverse Precision (weighted by Bias) as well as a weighted arithmetic mean of Recall and Inverse Recall (weighted by Prevalence). Inverse Precision and Inverse Recall are simply the Precision and Recall of the inverse problem where positive and negative labels are exchanged (for both real classes and prediction labels). Recall and Inverse Recall, or equivalently true positive rate and false positive rate, are frequently plotted against each other as ROC curves and provide a principled mechanism to explore operating point tradeoffs.", "BULLET::::- Precision is the probability that a (randomly selected) retrieved document is relevant.\nBULLET::::- Recall is the probability that a (randomly selected) relevant document is retrieved in a search.\n\nA measure that combines precision and recall is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, the traditional F-measure or balanced F-score:\n\nThere are other parameters and strategies for performance metric of information retrieval system, such as the area under the ROC curve (AUC)."], "wikipedia-4011785": ["In statistical analysis of binary classification, the F score (also F-score or F-measure) is a measure of a test's accuracy. It considers both the precision \"p\" and the recall \"r\" of the test to compute the score: \"p\" is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, and \"r\" is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive). The F score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall, where an F score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0."], "wikipedia-50716473": ["Section::::Offline metrics.:Precision.\nPrecision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are relevant to the user's information need.\nIn binary classification, precision is analogous to positive predictive value. Precision takes all retrieved documents into account. It can also be evaluated at a given cut-off rank, considering only the topmost results returned by the system. This measure is called \"precision at n\" or \"P@n\".\nNote that the meaning and usage of \"precision\" in the field of information retrieval differs from the definition of accuracy and precision within other branches of science and statistics.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Recall.\nRecall is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved.\nIn binary classification, recall is often called sensitivity. So it can be looked at as \"the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query\".\nIt is trivial to achieve recall of 100% by returning all documents in response to any query. Therefore, recall alone is not enough but one needs to measure the number of non-relevant documents also, for example by computing the precision.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:F-score / F-measure.\nThe weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, the traditional F-measure or balanced F-score is:\nThis is also known as the formula_11 measure, because recall and precision are evenly weighted.\nThe general formula for non-negative real formula_12 is:\nTwo other commonly used F measures are the formula_14 measure, which weights recall twice as much as precision, and the formula_15 measure, which weights precision twice as much as recall.\nThe F-measure was derived by van Rijsbergen (1979) so that formula_16 \"measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches formula_12 times as much importance to recall as precision\". It is based on van Rijsbergen's effectiveness measure formula_18. Their relationship is:\nF-measure can be a better single metric when compared to precision and recall; both precision and recall give different information that can complement each other when combined. If one of them excels more than the other, F-measure will reflect it."], "wikipedia-43218024": ["Sensitivity or True Positive Rate (TPR), also known as recall, is the proportion of people that tested positive and are positive (True Positive, TP) of all the people that actually are positive (Condition Positive, CP = TP + FN). It can be seen as \"the probability that the test is positive given that the patient is sick\". With higher sensitivity, fewer actual cases of disease go undetected (or, in the case of the factory quality control, fewer faulty products go to the market).\nSpecificity (SPC) or True Negative Rate (TNR) is the proportion of people that tested negative and are negative (True Negative, TN) of all the people that actually are negative (Condition Negative, CN = TN + FP). As with sensitivity, it can be looked at as \"the probability that the test result is negative given that the patient is not sick\". With higher specificity, fewer healthy people are labeled as sick (or, in the factory case, fewer good products are discarded).\nThe relationship between sensitivity and specificity, as well as the performance of the classifier, can be visualized and studied using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.\nIn addition to sensitivity and specificity, the performance of a binary classification test can be measured with positive predictive value (PPV), also known as precision, and negative predictive value (NPV). The positive prediction value answers the question \"If the test result is \"positive\", how well does that \"predict\" an actual presence of disease?\". It is calculated as TP/(TP + FP); that is, it is the proportion of true positives out of all positive results. The negative prediction value is the same, but for negatives, naturally.\nPerhaps the simplest statistic is accuracy or Fraction Correct (FC), which measures the fraction of all instances that are correctly categorized; it is the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the total number of correct or incorrect classifications: (TP + TN)/Total Population = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN). This is often not very useful, compared to the marginal ratios, as it does not yield useful marginal interpretations, due to mixing true positives (test positive, condition positive) and true negatives (test negative, condition negative) \u2013 in terms of the condition table, it sums the diagonal; further, it is prevalence-dependent. The complement is the Fraction Incorrect (FiC): FC + FiC = 1, or (FP + FN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN) \u2013 this is the sum of the antidiagonal, divided by the total population.", "An F-score is a combination of the precision and the recall, providing a single score.

It can disrupt activity and interfere with how well a neuron can encode a signal. Noise is observed as changes in the membrane potential of a cell. The change in potential causes the accuracy of a neuron to be limited in its transmission. This limited transmission has been coined the signal-to-noise ratio. As noise levels increase, one would assume a lowered ratio and therefore diminished signals. A diminished signal can be detrimental to a cell if neuronal maintenance is disrupted, or more importantly a necessary inhibitory response is lost. Noise limits the fidelity of a neuron's response to a signal or stimulus. The accuracy of the signal will impact how well higher parts of the brain or sensory system process information from the neurons.\n\nStochastic resonance is the term given to an instance when synaptic noise aids, rather than impairs, signal detection. With stochastic resonance, synaptic noise can amplify the recognition of signals that are below threshold potential in nonlinear, threshold-detecting systems. This is important in cells that receive and integrate thousands of synaptic inputs. These cells can often require numerous synaptic events to occur at the same time in order to produce an action potential, so the potential for receiving subthreshold signals is high. Signals from neurons that integrate activity of various neurons, when taken together, can form a complete image stimulus.\nNoise also allows neurons to detect weak visual signals by processing the level of contrast of the image.\nAnother positive use of synaptic noise is by involving frozen noise. Frozen noise refers to random current pulses of varying amplitudes being applied to the constant current input, and then maintaining this pattern so that it can be used to observe differences in other factors. Frozen noise allows researchers to reveal whether or not part of a neuron's response is dependent on a given stimulus because the other interfering conditions are held constant."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Theoretically, a random classifier should achieve an AUC score of $0.5$ for a two-class classification problem. Therefore, we expect to see a degradation in classification performance with regard to the previous experiments. Given that the BiGRU outperformed the RF model and relies only on raw mouse movements, we only challenge the BiGRU model in these experiments. As observed in \\autoref{tbl:results_with_noise}, using a radius of $\\sigma=0.25$\\,px is enough to degrade the performance of the BiGRU model, which begins to behave as a random classifier (AUC $\\approx 0.5$) of both age and gender. The differences between the original mouse data and the degraded versions are statistically significant at the $p < .001$ level. Hence, this experiment justifies further our proposal to prevent user profiling techniques that exploit mouse cursor movements data. We argue that by using this adversarial noise, a mouse movement trajectory would become ``illegible'' to any machine learning model trying to classify the user's age or gender. Indeed, by scrambling both spatial and temporal information from a mouse cursor trajectory we are effectively signaling a seemingly arbitrary and jittery movement. To validate further the validity of this adversarial noise, we re-trained our BiGRU model with distorted mouse data, using the same configuration from our previous experiments (\\autoref{sssec:rnn_model}). Now each mouse sequence is distorted according to a random uniform distribution $\\sigma \\sim \\mathcal{U}(0,1)$, which means that some coordinates are preserved ($\\sigma=0$) whereas others are more distorted ($\\sigma=1$).

In animals, noise can increase the risk of death by altering predator or prey detection and avoidance, interfere with reproduction and navigation, and contribute to permanent hearing loss. While the elderly may have cardiac problems due to noise, according to the World Health Organization, children are especially vulnerable to noise, and the effects that noise has on children may be permanent. Noise poses a serious threat to a child\u2019s physical and psychological health, and may negatively interfere with a child's learning and behavior.\nNoise pollution affects both health and behavior. Unwanted sound (noise) can damage physiological health. Noise pollution can cause hypertension, high stress levels, tinnitus, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and other harmful and disturbing effects. According to a 2019 review of the existing literature, noise pollution was associated with faster cognitive decline.\nSound becomes unwanted when it either interferes with normal activities such as sleep or conversation, or disrupts or diminishes one's quality of life. Noise-induced hearing loss can be caused by prolonged exposure to noise levels above 85 A-weighted decibels. A comparison of Maaban tribesmen, who were insignificantly exposed to transportation or industrial noise, to a typical U.S. population showed that chronic exposure to moderately high levels of environmental noise contributes to hearing loss.\nNoise exposure in the workplace can also contribute to noise-induced hearing loss and other health issues. Occupational hearing loss is one of the most common work-related illnesses in the U.S. and worldwide.\nNoise pollution can have negative affects on adults and children on the autistic spectrum. Those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can have hyperacusis, which is an abnormal sensitivity to sound. People with ASD who experience hyperacusis may have unpleasant emotions, such as fear and anxiety, and uncomfortable physical sensations in noisy environments with loud sounds. This can cause individuals with ASD to avoid environments with noise pollution, which in turn can result in isolation and negatively affect their quality of life. Sudden explosive noises typical of high-performance car exhausts and car alarms are types of noise pollution that can affect people with ASD.\nNoise can have a detrimental effect on animals, increasing the risk of death by changing the delicate balance in predator or prey detection and avoidance, and interfering the use of the sounds in communication, especially in relation to reproduction and in navigation. These effects then may alter more interactions within a community through indirect (\u201cdomino\u201d) effects. Acoustic overexposure can lead to temporary or permanent loss of hearing.\nEuropean robins living in urban environments are more likely to sing at night in places with high levels of noise pollution during the day, suggesting that they sing at night because it is quieter, and their message can propagate through the environment more clearly. The same study showed that daytime noise was a stronger predictor of nocturnal singing than night-time light pollution, to which the phenomenon often is attributed. Anthropogenic noise reduced the species richness of birds found in Neoptropical urban parks.\nZebra finches become less faithful to their partners when exposed to traffic noise. This could alter a population's evolutionary trajectory by selecting traits, sapping resources normally devoted to other activities and thus leading to profound genetic and evolutionary consequences.\nUnderwater noise pollution due to human activities is also prevalent in the sea. Cargo ships generate high levels of noise due to propellers and diesel engines\n. This noise pollution significantly raises the low-frequency ambient noise levels above those caused by wind. Animals such as whales that depend on sound for communication can be affected by this noise in various ways. Even marine invertebrates, such as crabs (\"Carcinus maenas\"), have been shown to be negatively affected by ship noise. Larger crabs were noted to be negatively affected more by the sounds than smaller crabs. Repeated exposure to the sounds did lead to acclimatization.\nHigher ambient noise levels also cause animals to vocalize more loudly, which is called the Lombard effect. Researchers have found that humpback whales' song lengths were longer when low-frequency sonar was active nearby. \nNoise pollution may have caused the death of certain species of whales that beached themselves after being exposed to the loud sound of military sonar. (see also Marine mammals and sonar)"], "wikipedia-15774067": ["Section::::Implications.:As a negative factor.\nNoise in neurons is due to intrinsic and extrinsic sources. It can disrupt activity and interfere with how well a neuron can encode a signal. Noise is observed as changes in the membrane potential of a cell. The change in potential causes the accuracy of a neuron to be limited in its transmission. This limited transmission has been coined the signal-to-noise ratio. As noise levels increase, one would assume a lowered ratio and therefore diminished signals. A diminished signal can be detrimental to a cell if neuronal maintenance is disrupted, or more importantly a necessary inhibitory response is lost. Noise limits the fidelity of a neuron's response to a signal or stimulus. The accuracy of the signal will impact how well higher parts of the brain or sensory system process information from the neurons.\nSection::::Implications.:As a positive factor.\nStochastic resonance is the term given to an instance when synaptic noise aids, rather than impairs, signal detection. With stochastic resonance, synaptic noise can amplify the recognition of signals that are below threshold potential in nonlinear, threshold-detecting systems. This is important in cells that receive and integrate thousands of synaptic inputs. These cells can often require numerous synaptic events to occur at the same time in order to produce an action potential, so the potential for receiving subthreshold signals is high. Signals from neurons that integrate activity of various neurons, when taken together, can form a complete image stimulus.\nNoise also allows neurons to detect weak visual signals by processing the level of contrast of the image.\nAnother positive use of synaptic noise is by involving frozen noise. Frozen noise refers to random current pulses of varying amplitudes being applied to the constant current input, and then maintaining this pattern so that it can be used to observe differences in other factors. Frozen noise allows researchers to reveal whether or not part of a neuron's response is dependent on a given stimulus because the other interfering conditions are held constant."], "wikipedia-56304602": ["Noise pollution is widespread, which is mostly a result of transportation networks. Although there are many effects of noise pollution, two specific consequences are adjustments in population distribution and modified animal communication. Birds provide a clear example of both of these consequences. Altered population distributions can affect inter-species interactions. For example, the diversity of birds in the woodlands of New Mexico was significantly reduced in areas with unnatural noise levels. This change in diversity resulted in less nest predation, which was explained by the decreased presence of the dominant predator - the scrub-jay. This effect has also been observed in owls. A negative correlation was found between the noise intensity of an area and the probability that a long-eared owl will reside in that region. Suggested explanations for this outcome are that hunting efficiency was diminished and communication was less effective.\nNoise pollution also affects conspecific communication. High noise levels may require animals to adjust their vocalizations in order for communication to remain effective. Bird songs are a well-studied component of animal communication. The use of adjusted songs was observed in Savannah sparrows residing in noisy environments. Adjusted songs were so distinct that their use in the control environment did not result in responses (i.e. aggressive territorial behaviour) typically observed when non-adjusted songs were vocalized. Failure to recognize conspecific vocalizations can also be detrimental to male-male competition. Male urban white-crowned sparrows approached stimulus songs of intruders more closely, regardless of song type, when in the presence of noise pollution. A higher frequency of harmful fights is a suggested consequence of this behaviour because of the relatively small distance between the intruding and defending males.\nNoise pollution can also affect marine animals. There are many sources of noise in the world's oceans, such as the sounds produced by commercial shipping, sonars and acoustic deterrents. Unnatural noise levels can negatively affect reproductive behaviour, such as courtship behaviours. For example, painted goby males did not take part in visual courtship behaviour when in a noisy environment. Female painted gobies in this experiment were also less likely to spawn in a noisy environment. Noise pollution can also affect foraging behaviour in marine animals, which results in less effective strategies. Porpoises have been found to make fewer prey capture attempts, dive deeper, and cut their foraging behaviour short when a vessel passes by, which results in a higher energy expenditure. Shore crabs were also observed interrupting their foraging behaviour when in the presence of ship noise."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. **Yes**  \n2.

While the *original study's* data/code would be excluded, general principles, theoretical analyses, and empirical findings from other studies could partially address the query by explaining how noise distorts metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, SNR) and the broader consequences (e.g., reliability thresholds, mitigation strategies)."}, "paper/32": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

In general, if the probability distributions for both detection and false alarm are known, the ROC curve can be generated by plotting the cumulative distribution function (area under the probability distribution from formula_1 to the discrimination threshold) of the detection probability in the y-axis versus the cumulative distribution function of the false-alarm probability on the x-axis.\nROC analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution. ROC analysis is related in a direct and natural way to cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making.\nThe ROC curve was first developed by electrical engineers and radar engineers during World War II for detecting enemy objects in battlefields and was soon introduced to psychology to account for perceptual detection of stimuli. ROC analysis since then has been used in medicine, radiology, biometrics, forecasting of natural hazards, meteorology, model performance assessment, and other areas for many decades and is increasingly used in machine learning and data mining research.\nThe ROC is also known as a relative operating characteristic curve, because it is a comparison of two operating characteristics (TPR and FPR) as the criterion changes.", "When using normalized units, the area under the curve (often referred to as simply the AUC) is equal to the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one (assuming 'positive' ranks higher than 'negative'). This can be seen as follows: the area under the curve is given by (the integral boundaries are reversed as large T has a lower value on the x-axis) where formula_13 is the score for a positive instance and formula_14 is the score for a negative instance, and formula_15 and formula_16 are probability densities as defined in previous section. It can further be shown that the AUC is closely related to the Mann\u2013Whitney U, which tests whether positives are ranked higher than negatives. It is also equivalent to the Wilcoxon test of ranks. The AUC is related to the Gini coefficient (formula_17) by the formula formula_18, where: In this way, it is possible to calculate the AUC by using an average of a number of trapezoidal approximations."], "wikipedia-53881364": ["The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) also characterizes diagnostic ability, although ROC reveals less information than the TOC. For each threshold, ROC reveals two ratios, hits/(hits + misses) and false alarms/(false alarms + correct rejections), while TOC shows the total information in the contingency table for each threshold. The TOC method reveals all of the information that the ROC method provides, plus additional important information that ROC does not reveal, i.e. the size of every entry in the contingency table for each threshold. TOC also provides the popular area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC.\n\nWhen measuring diagnostic ability, a commonly reported measure is the Area Under the Curve (AUC). The AUC is calculable from the TOC and the ROC. The AUC indicates the probability that the diagnosis ranks a randomly chosen observation of Boolean presence higher than a randomly chosen observation of Boolean absence."], "wikipedia-42630847": ["ROC curves plot the sensitivity of a biomarker on the y axis, against the false discovery rate (1- specificity) on the x axis.

The AUC (area under the curve) of the ROC curve reflects the overall accuracy and the separation performance of the biomarker (or biomarkers), and can be readily used to compare different biomarker combinations or models.

Shot noise also occurs in photon counting in optical devices, where shot noise is associated with the particle nature of light.\n\nShot noise exists because phenomena such as light and electric current consist of the movement of discrete (also called \"quantized\") 'packets'. Consider light\u2014a stream of discrete photons\u2014coming out of a laser pointer and hitting a wall to create a visible spot. The fundamental physical processes that govern light emission are such that these photons are emitted from the laser at random times; but the many billions of photons needed to create a spot are so many that the brightness, the number of photons per unit of time, varies only infinitesimally with time. However, if the laser brightness is reduced until only a handful of photons hit the wall every second, the relative fluctuations in number of photons, i.e., brightness, will be significant, just as when tossing a coin a few times. These fluctuations are shot noise.\n\nThe term can also be used to describe any noise source, even if solely mathematical, of similar origin. For instance, particle simulations may produce a certain amount of \"noise\", where due to the small number of particles simulated, the simulation exhibits undue statistical fluctuations which don't reflect the real-world system. The magnitude of shot noise increases according to the square root of the expected number of events, such as the electric current or intensity of light. But since the strength of the signal itself increases more rapidly, the \"relative\" proportion of shot noise decreases and the signal to noise ratio (considering only shot noise) increases anyway.

In so doing, users can be seen as rejecting the shame associated with their private lives. Other scholars note that surveillance is fundamentally dependent upon location in both physical and virtual environments. This form of surveillance can be seen in travel websites which enable the user to share their vacation to a virtual audience. The person\u2019s willingness to share their personal information online is validated by the audience, since the audience holds the user accountable and the user vicariously experiences pleasure through the audience. Further, users' mobile data is increasingly being shared to third parties online, potentially underscoring the regulatory challenges inherent in protecting users' online privacy.\nIn addition, scholars argue that users have the right to know the value of their personal data. Increasingly, users\u2019 digital identity is becoming commodified through the selling and monetizing of their personal data for profit by large companies. Unfortunately, many people appear to be unaware of the fact that their data holds monetary value that can potentially be used towards other products and services. Thus, scholars are arguing for users\u2019 to have increased awareness and transparency into this process so that users can become empowered and informed consumers of data.\nThe increased usage of cross-device tracking by advertisers is indicative of the rise of a new era of data extraction and analysis as a form of profit, or surveillance capitalism, a term coined by Shoshana Zuboff. This form of capitalism seeks to commodify private human experience to create behavioral futures markets, in which behavior is predicted and behavioral data is harvested from the user. Zuboff suggests that this new era of surveillance capitalism eclipses Bentham's panopticon, becoming far more encroaching and invasive as, unlike a prison, there is no escape, and the thoughts, feelings, and actions of users are immediately extracted to be commodified and resold. Thus, since cross-device tracking seeks to create a profile of a user across multiple devices, big tech companies, such as Google, could use this behavioral data to make predictions about the user\u2019s future behavior without the user\u2019s awareness.", "Ethically, Zuboff points to the extraction, commodification, and analysis of private human experiences as well as increased surveillance\u2013\u2013which is sometimes hidden\u2013\u2013in everyday life as violating users' rights to privacy.

While extensions like these have been successful in mitigating the user's exposure to web tracking, they eventually hurt web revenue streams, leading to the so called \"tragedy of the commons,\" where the common resource (user attention) will be depleted due to ad blocking. Luckily, some effort has been put to regulate the web tracking landscape, like self-initiatives from the ad industry that include recommendations for good practices and transparency tools such as AdChoices, to help users understand why they receive specific ads. Along the same line, privacy-preserving web browsers allow users to have more control of their online privacy and, at the same time, a financial incentive by the ads that they receive while surfing the web. Moreover, in 2018 the European Union set in place the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the state of California in United States enforced the Consumer Privacy Act. Other countries are also following the same route, yet currently online advertising is ubiquitous. Also, it remains the dominant monetization model on the Web, with constantly increasing growth rates and revenues. This has promoted advancements in user tracking and profiling technologies that allow to serve more relevant ad content to the user, and at a higher premium, known as targeted ads or Online Behavioral Advertising. Web tracking and user profiling rely on mechanisms to uniquely identify and track the user's online behavior over time, including e.g., geolocation, visited pages, search keywords, and social network activity. All of these in order to better understand the user intentions and interests. However, a less known method to profile the user is by means of mouse cursor tracking. This technology has been used successfully to inform usability tests, predict user engagement and intent, detect searcher frustration, and infer user attention to parts of a web page, among other tasks. Unfortunately, because mouse cursor tracking can be performed unobtrusively and at scale, it has opened the door to a brand new wave of massive tracking campaigns and companies that hide behind laudable objectives, such as providing fine-grained, in-page analytics (e.g., hovered and clicked items, scroll reach, speed of browsing) to the website owners. Interestingly, by tracking the mouse cursor it is possible to profile the user demographics, namely predicting age and gender, a piece of valuable personal data that most users are unaware of.

We do not argue, however, that mouse tracking should be removed from any website, as it may be a valuable data source for various application scenarios. Rather, we find it disconcerting that currently there is no way for end-users to opt-out easily.\nThe work presented here serves a dual purpose. First, it aims at raising awareness on the emerging privacy threats in the online world and exposes some of the unaccounted ---yet sizeable risks--- of tracking technologies. Even when dealing with a seemingly harmless browser activity logging practice, such as the collection of mouse cursor coordinates, a third party can mine this data to uncover personally identifiable information about the users.\nFinally, we hope that this work will motivate further research to counterbalance initiatives on developing privacy-invasive user profiling technologies by delivering techniques that can preserve user anonymity and protect personally identifiable information.\nThis work also highlights the need for more transparency and privacy-aware tools.

However, the research literature on mouse cursor tracking has pointed out far more advanced and creative use cases for this technology. The above studies demonstrate that certain cognitive and motor control mechanisms are embodied and reflected, to some extent, in our mouse cursor movements and online interactions. In other words, mouse cursor movements can disclose sensitive information that may be employed for advanced user profiling, such as the identification of demographics, personality traits, and browsing intent. For brevity's sake, in the remainder of this paper we will focus on predicting demographics (age and gender) from mouse cursor movements, but we argue that other, potentially sensitive information may remain vulnerable and could be exposed if appropriate mechanisms are put into place."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Cases of such algorithmic bias have been reported everywhere from loan services to the criminal justice system. In a recent review of the Florida court system by ProPublica, it was found that COMPAS, a risk assessment software used by judges, was twice as likely to label people of color as at risk for recidivism. In March of 2018, in an effort to address rising concerns over machine learning\u2019s impact on human rights, the World Economic Forum and Global Future Council on Human Rights published a white paper with detailed recommendations on how best to prevent discriminatory outcomes in machine learning. The World Economic Forum developed four recommendations based on the \"UN Guiding Principles of Human Rights\" to help address and prevent discriminatory outcomes in machine learning.\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s recommendations are as follows: \nBULLET::::1. Active Inclusion: the development and design of machine learning applications must actively seek a diversity of input, especially of the norms and values of specific populations affected by the output of AI systems\nBULLET::::2. Fairness: People involved in conceptualizing, developing, and implementing machine learning systems should consider which definition of fairness best applies to their context and application, and prioritize it in the architecture of the machine learning system and its evaluation metrics\nBULLET::::3. Right to Understanding: Involvement of machine learning systems in decision-making that affects individual rights must be disclosed, and the systems must be able to provide an explanation of their decision-making that is understandable to end users and reviewable by a competent human authority. Where this is impossible and rights are at stake, leaders in the design, deployment, and regulation of machine learning technology must question whether or not it should be used\nBULLET::::4. Access to Redress: Leaders, designers, and developers of machine learning systems are responsible for identifying the potential negative human rights impacts of their systems. They must make visible avenues for redress for those affected by disparate impacts, and establish processes for the timely redress of any discriminatory outputs.\nAs the ubiquity of machine learning and artificial intelligence grows, it is critical for technology companies to take the necessary precautions to prevent discrimination and heed the advice of World Economic Forum Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab, remembering, \"\u2026 new technologies are first and foremost tools made by people for people.\" \nSection::::Approaches.\nSeveral attempts have been made to make ethics computable or at least formal. Whereas Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics are usually not considered to be suitable for an artificial moral agent, it has been studied whether Kant's categorical imperative can be used. However, it has been pointed out that human value is in some aspects very complex. A way to explicitly surmount this difficulty is to receive human values directly from them through some mechanism, for example by learning them. Another approach is to base current ethical considerations on previous similar situations. This is called casuistry and it could be implemented through research on the internet. The consensus from a million past decisions would lead to a new decision that is democracy dependent. This could, however, lead to decisions that reflect biases and unethical behaviors exhibited in society. The negative effects of this approach can be seen in Microsoft's Tay (bot), where the chatterbot learned to repeat racist and sexually charged messages sent by Twitter users."], "wikipedia-50018370": ["Section::::Privacy and surveillance concerns.:Ultrasonic tracking.\nCross-device tracking has privacy implications and allows for more detailed tracking of users than traditional tracking methods. Data can be collected from multiple devices used by a single user and correlated to form a more accurate picture of the person being tracked. Moreover, malicious actors may use variants of the technology to deanonymize anonymity network users.\nUltrasonic tracking technologies can pose massive threats to users\u2019 privacy. There are four primary privacy concerns associated with this new form of tracking:\nBULLET::::- The first is \"media tracking\": audio from the user\u2019s television may be detected by the microphone in the user\u2019s mobile device, allowing malicious actors to gain access to what the user is watching\u2013\u2013particularly if it is salacious. Advertisers can similarly gain insight into what a user typically watches. In both scenarios, a user\u2019s real-world behavior is linked to their online identity and used for tracking.\nBULLET::::- Another form of tracking permitted by ultrasonic tracking is \"cross-device tracking\", which enables a user\u2019s profile to be connected across multiple devices based on proximity. This form of tracking, in linking different devices, can help advertisers show more targeted ads or open individuals to attacks by malicious actors.\nBULLET::::- \"Location tracking\" is yet another privacy concern. Indeed, ultrasonic signals can convey location information via a location identifier, often placed in stores or businesses.\nBULLET::::- Lastly, this new ultrasonic tracking poses a threat to users of Bitcoin and Tor because it \"deanonymizes\" users\u2019 information, since ultrasonic signals associate the user\u2019s mobile phone with the Bitcoin or Tor account.\nSection::::Privacy and surveillance concerns.:Panoptic surveillance and the commodification of users' digital identity.\nFrom cookies to ultrasonic trackers, some argue that invasive forms of surveillance underscore how users are trapped in a digital panopticon, similar to the concept envisioned by Jeremy Bentham: a prison in which the prisoners were able to be seen at all times by guards but were unable to detect when, or even if, they were being watched at all, creating a sense of paranoia that drove prisoners to carefully police their own behavior. Similarly, scholars have drawn parallels between Bentham\u2019s panopticon and today\u2019s pervasive use of internet tracking in that individuals lack awareness to the vast disparities of power that exist between themselves and the corporation to which they willingly give their data. In essence, companies are able to gain access to consumers\u2019 activity when they use a company\u2019s services. The usage of these services often is beneficial, which is why users agree to exchange personal information. However, since users participate in this unequal environment, in which corporations hold most of the power and in which the user is obliged to accept the bad faith offers made by the corporations, users are operating in an environment that ultimately controls, shapes and molds them to think and behave in a certain way, depriving them of privacy.", "Some scholars have even contended that in an age of increased surveillance, users now participate online through the active generation and curation of online images\u2013\u2013a form of control. In so doing, users can be seen as rejecting the shame associated with their private lives. Other scholars note that surveillance is fundamentally dependent upon location in both physical and virtual environments. This form of surveillance can be seen in travel websites which enable the user to share their vacation to a virtual audience. The person\u2019s willingness to share their personal information online is validated by the audience, since the audience holds the user accountable and the user vicariously experiences pleasure through the audience. Further, users' mobile data is increasingly being shared to third parties online, potentially underscoring the regulatory challenges inherent in protecting users' online privacy.\nIn addition, scholars argue that users have the right to know the value of their personal data. Increasingly, users\u2019 digital identity is becoming commodified through the selling and monetizing of their personal data for profit by large companies. Unfortunately, many people appear to be unaware of the fact that their data holds monetary value that can potentially be used towards other products and services. Thus, scholars are arguing for users\u2019 to have increased awareness and transparency into this process so that users can become empowered and informed consumers of data.\nSection::::Privacy and surveillance concerns.:Surveillance capitalism.\nThe increased usage of cross-device tracking by advertisers is indicative of the rise of a new era of data extraction and analysis as a form of profit, or surveillance capitalism, a term coined by Shoshana Zuboff. This form of capitalism seeks to commodify private human experience to create behavioral futures markets, in which behavior is predicted and behavioral data is harvested from the user. Zuboff suggests that this new era of surveillance capitalism eclipses Bentham's panopticon, becoming far more encroaching and invasive as, unlike a prison, there is no escape, and the thoughts, feelings, and actions of users are immediately extracted to be commodified and resold. Thus, since cross-device tracking seeks to create a profile of a user across multiple devices, big tech companies, such as Google, could use this behavioral data to make predictions about the user\u2019s future behavior without the user\u2019s awareness.\nScholars are beginning to discuss the possibility of quantifying the monetary value of users\u2019 personal data. Notably, the algorithms used to extract and mine user data are increasingly seen as business assets and thus protected via trade secrets. Indeed, the usage of free online services, such as public Wi-Fi, often comes at the unknown cost to the user of being tracked and profiled by the company providing the service. In essence, a transaction is occurring: users\u2019 personal data is being exchanged for access to a free service. Increasingly, scholars are advocating for users\u2019 right to understand the fundamental value of their personal data more intimately so as to be more savvy, informed consumers who have the ability to protect the privacy of their online information and not be manipulated into unwittingly giving away personal information.\nSection::::Privacy and surveillance concerns.:Health and wellness applications.\nIn addition, health and wellness applications also have a dearth of privacy protections as well: a study found that many health apps lacked encryption and that regulators should enforce stronger data privacy protections. The study stated that of the 79 apps they tested, none of the applications locally encrypted the users\u2019 personal information and 89% of the applications pushed the data online. The lack of adequate privacy and security measures surrounding users\u2019 personal medical data on mobile applications underscores the lessening degree to which users can trust mobile app developers to safeguard their personal information online. While mobile application developers continue to confront privacy and security concerns, users are increasingly looking to ways to visualize their data through wearable devices and applications that track their workout and exercise routines. Indeed, researchers discovered that these self-tracking devices play a role as a tool, a toy, and a tutor in users\u2019 lives. In the tool role, the self-tracking device functions as a mechanism to help the user in some capacity, often to achieve personal health goals. The toy role underscores how some self-tracking users see it as a fun game, particularly with regard to rewards and viewing the visualized data. Lastly, the tutor role reflects how users gain insights from and motivation about their activity from the apps themselves. Other scholars have characterized self-tracking as performing for the system, or controlling what is (or isn\u2019t) recorded, performing for the self, tracking themselves to gain insight into their behavior, and performing for other people, or the importance of how other people viewed the person being tracked, as well as the control the person being tracked had over their data and thus how they are perceived.\nSection::::Privacy and surveillance concerns.:Cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons.\nAdditionally, privacy concerns surround cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons on websites today. Ultimately, five main concerns surround the usage of cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons, according to a study:\nBULLET::::- Firstly, the authors note that users lack \"anonymity\" online, with cookies utilizing unique identifiers and flash cookies enabling recognition of website visits\nBULLET::::- Another concern the authors note is \"unintended uses of cookies,\" since cookies were initially designed to benefit the user\u2019s experience and engagement online, but have since morphed into a business run by advertisers in which personal data is sold for profit\nBULLET::::- Users are likely unaware of how their personal information is being used, reflecting the \"surreptitious nature of data collection\"\nBULLET::::- Some cookies \"trespass into the web users\u2019 own resources\" and are downloaded to the user\u2019s computer often without the user\u2019s awareness\nBULLET::::- Lastly, the authors note that the \"threat of cookie sharing\" underscores how web users\u2019 personal information can become combined with other data from websites and even a social security number to create a more cohesive picture of the user\nSection::::Privacy and surveillance concerns.:Data capitalism.\nOther scholars have defined a similarly extractive and destructive phenomenon called data capitalism. Data capitalism is an economic system enabling the redistribution of power towards those who have access to the information\u2013\u2013namely, big corporations. There are three fundamental theories of how large companies engage users in virtual communities, reflecting the power of data capitalism on users today:\nBULLET::::- The free and open network: in making products free, large companies make their products more accessible to a larger audience from which they can extract valuable data in exchange.\nBULLET::::- The connection between people and machines: data capitalism promotes a connection between people and machines which is derived from the user\u2019s relationship to the technology itself. Increasingly, tracking and surveillance technology is profiling users and learning their preferences, users become more comfortable with their devices and a self-fulfilling prophecy continues.\nBULLET::::- The value placed on data: new information asymmetries are proliferating that exacerbate inequality of information and allow only the most powerful access to most people\u2019s data. Increasingly, a scholar suggests that the lack of transparency over users\u2019 data reflects the tension between privacy and community online.\nSection::::Privacy and surveillance concerns.:Solutions.\nScholars are convinced the current notice-and-consent model for privacy policies is fundamentally flawed because it assumes users intuitively understand all of the facts in a privacy policy, which is often not the case. Instead, scholars emphasize the imperative role of creating a culture in which privacy becomes a social norm. In effect, users of online technologies should identify the social activities they use on the internet and start questioning websites' governing norms as a natural outgrowth of their web browsing. In effect, these norms need to prevent websites from collecting and sharing users' personal information. In addition, starting with a user's personal values and seeing how these values correlate with online norms may be another way to assess whether or not privacy norms are being violated in odd cases. Ultimately, scholars believe these privacy norms are vital to protecting both individuals and social institutions.", "Ethically, Zuboff points to the extraction, commodification, and analysis of private human experiences as well as increased surveillance\u2013\u2013which is sometimes hidden\u2013\u2013in everyday life as violating users' rights to privacy. The usage of surreptitious methods, in which the user is unaware of the extent to which he or she is being tracked, brings tracking mechanisms\u2013\u2013such as cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons\u2013\u2013into the ethical realm as well since users are not being informed of this tracking perhaps as often as they should."], "wikipedia-31602166": ["Civil libertarians worry that social networking sites, particularly Facebook, have greatly diminished user confidentiality in numerous ways. For one thing, when social media platforms store private data, they also have complete access to that material as well. To sustain their profitability, applications like Facebook examine and market personal information by logging data through cookies, small files that stockpile the data on someone's device. Companies, such as Facebook, carry extensive amounts of private user information on file, regarding individuals\u2019 , \u201clikes, dislikes, and preferences\u201d, which are of high value to marketers. As Facebook reveals user information to advertising and marketing organizations, personalized endorsements will appear on news feeds based on \u201csurfing behavior, hobbies, or pop culture preferences\u201d. For those reasons, Facebook's critics fear that social networking companies may seek business ventures with stockholders by sharing user information in the exchange of profits. Additionally, they argue that since Facebook demonstrates an illusion of privacy presented by a \u201cfor-friends-only\u201d type of platform, individuals find themselves more inclined to showcase more personal information online. According to the critics, users might notice that the sponsorships and commercials are tailored to their disclosed private data, which could result in a sense of betrayal.", "Facebook has been under fire for keeping track of one's Internet usage whether users are logged into the social media site or not. A user may notice personalized ads under the 'Sponsored' area of the page. 'The company uses cookies to log data such as the date, time, URL, and your IP address whenever you visit a site that has a Facebook plug-in, such as a 'Like' button.' Facebook claims this data is used to help improve one's experience on the website and to protect against 'malicious' activity. Another issue of privacy that Facebook uses is the new facial recognition software. This feature includes the software to identify photos that users are tagged in by developing a template based on one's facial features.\n\nSimilar to Rotenberg's claim that Facebook users are unclear of how or why their information has gone public, recently the Federal Trade Commission and Commerce Department have become involved. The Federal Trade Commission has recently released a report claiming that Internet companies and other industries will soon need to increase their protection for online users. Because online users often unknowingly opt in on making their information public, the FTC is urging Internet companies to make privacy notes simpler and easier for the public to understand, therefore increasing their option to opt out. Perhaps this new policy should also be implemented in the Facebook world. The Commerce Department claims that Americans, 'have been ill-served by a patchwork of privacy laws that contain broad gaps,'. Because of these broad gaps, Americans are more susceptible to identity theft and having their online activity tracked by others.\n\nA leaked document from Facebook has revealed that the company was able to identify 'insecure, worthless, stressed or defeated' emotions, especially in teenagers, and then proceeded to inform advertisers. While similar issues have arisen in the past, this continues to make individuals\u2019 emotional states seem more like a commodity. They are able to target certain age groups depending on the time that their advertisements appear.\n\nRecently, Facebook, knowingly agreed and facilitated a controversial experiment; the experiment blatantly bypassed user privacy and demonstrates the dangers and complex ethical nature of the current networking management system. The 'one week study in January of 2012' where over 600,000 users were randomly selected to unknowingly partake in a study to determine the effect of 'emotional alteration' by Facebook posts. Apart from the ethical issue of conducting such a study with human emotion in the first place, this is just one of the means in which data outsourcing has been used as a breach of privacy without user disclosure.\n\nInstagram tracks users' photos even if they do not post them using a geotag. The app geotags an uploaded image regardless of whether the user chose to share its location or not. Therefore, anybody can view the exact location where an image was uploaded on a map. This is concerning due to the fact that most people upload photos from their home or other locations they frequent a lot, and the fact that locations are so easily shared raises privacy concerns of stalking and sexual predators being able to find their target in person after discovering them online."], "wikipedia-59012195": ["Privacy concerns regarding search engines can take many forms, such as search engines logging individual search queries, browsing history, IP addresses, and cookies of users, and conducting user profiling in general. The collection of personally identifiable information of users by search engines is referred to as \"tracking\". \nThis is controversial because search engines often claim to collect a user's data in order to tailor better results to that specific user and provide the user with a better searching experience. However, search engines can also abuse and compromise its users' privacy by selling their data to advertisers for profit. In the absence of regulations, users must decide what is more important to their search engine experience: relevance and speed of results or their privacy, and choose a search engine accordingly.\n\nWhat search engines often do once they have collected information about a user's habits is create a profile of them, which helps the search engine decide which links to show for different search queries submitted by that user or which ads to target them with. An interesting development in this field is the invention of automated learning, also known as machine learning. Using this, search engines can refine their profiling models to more accurately predict what any given user may want to click on by doing A/B testing of results offered to users and measuring the reactions of users.\n\nThere are many who believe that user profiling is a severe invasion of user privacy, and there are organizations such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and Privacy International that are focused on advocating for user privacy rights. In fact, EPIC filed a complaint in 2007 with the Federal Trade Commission claiming that Google should not be able to acquire DoubleClick on the grounds that it would compromise user privacy.\n\nMany individuals and scholars have recognized the ethical concerns regarding search engine privacy.", "This collection of user data can also be seen as an overreach by private companies for their own financial gain or as an intrusive surveillance tactic. Search engines can make money using targeted advertising because advertisers are willing to pay a premium to present their ads to the most receptive consumers. Also, when a search engine collects and catalogs large amounts of data about its users, there is the potential for it to be leaked accidentally or breached. The government can also subpoena user data from search engines when they have databases of it. Search query database information may also be subpoenaed by private litigants for use in civil cases, such as divorces or employment disputes."], "wikipedia-28486111": ["The ethics of data collection, analytics, reporting and accountability has been raised as a potential concern for learning analytics, with concerns raised regarding:\nBULLET::::- Data ownership\nBULLET::::- Communications around the scope and role of learning analytics\nBULLET::::- The necessary role of human feedback and error-correction in learning analytics systems\nBULLET::::- Data sharing between systems, organisations, and stakeholders\nBULLET::::- Trust in data clients\nAs Kay, Kom and Oppenheim point out, the range of data is wide, potentially derived from:\nBULLET::::- Recorded activity: student records, attendance, assignments, researcher information (CRIS)\nBULLET::::- Systems interactions: VLE, library / repository search, card transactions\nBULLET::::- Feedback mechanisms: surveys, customer care\nBULLET::::- External systems that offer reliable identification such as sector and shared services and social networks\nThus the legal and ethical situation is challenging and different from country to country, raising implications for:\nBULLET::::- Variety of data: principles for collection, retention and exploitation\nBULLET::::- Education mission: underlying issues of learning management, including social and performance engineering\nBULLET::::- Motivation for development of analytics: mutuality, a combination of corporate, individual and general good\nBULLET::::- Customer expectation: effective business practice, social data expectations, cultural considerations of a global customer base.\nBULLET::::- Obligation to act: duty of care arising from knowledge and the consequent challenges of student and employee performance management\nIn some prominent cases like the inBloom disaster, even full functional systems have been shut down due to lack of trust in the data collection by governments, stakeholders and civil rights groups.

However, as targeted ads are believed to produce increased revenues, various intermediary companies (such as ad platforms and ad exchanges) are tracking users at scale, and often in an unregulated manner, which has resulted in a privacy nightmare. Privacy is essential for the citizens of both the physical and the digital world. But also privacy is constantly being juxtaposed with competing goods and interests, balanced against disparate needs and demands. More importantly, the loss of privacy translates into a loss of freedom. In other words, freedom of expression is threatened by the surveillance of our digital traces; thought patterns and intentions can be extrapolated from website visits (rightly or wrongly), and the knowledge that we are being surveyed can make one less likely to research a particular topic. And even efforts to regulate the web tracking landscape, such as the DNT Header, require good faith cooperation from the parties at the other end of the web connection, which is not always guaranteed.

Credit card information, social security numbers, phone numbers, mothers' maiden names, addresses and phone numbers freely collected and shared over the internet may lead to a loss of Privacy.\nFraud and impersonation are some of the malicious activities that occur due to the direct or indirect abuse of private information. Identity theft is rising rapidly due to the availability of private information in the internet. For instance, seven million Americans fell victim to identity theft in 2002, and nearly 12 million Americans were victims of identity theft in 2011 making it the fastest growing crime in the United States.\nProponents of unrestricted file sharing point out how file sharing has given people broader and faster access to media, has increased exposure to new artists, and has reduced the costs of transferring media (including less environmental damage). Supporters of restrictions on file sharing argue that we must protect the income of our artists and other people who work to create our media. This argument is partially answered by pointing to the small proportion of money artists receive from the legitimate sale of media.\nWith the introduction of digital rights management software, new issues are raised over whether the subverting of DRM is ethical. Some champion the hackers of DRM as defenders of users' rights, allowing the blind to make audio books of PDFs they receive, allowing people to burn music they have legitimately bought to CD or to transfer it to a new computer. Others see this as nothing but simply a violation of the rights of the intellectual property holders, opening the door to uncompensated use of copyrighted media. Another ethical issue concerning DRMs involves the way these systems could undermine the fair use provisions of the copyright laws. The reason is that these allow content providers to choose who can view or listen to their materials making the discrimination against certain groups possible. In addition, the level of control given to content providers could lead to the invasion of user privacy since the system is able to keep tabs on the personal information and activities of users who access their materials."], "wikipedia-16927210": ["Hackett argues that a \"forum on the internet [...] can function as a specialized or smaller-scale public sphere.\" In the past, the internet has been an ideal location for the general public to gather and discuss relevant news issues \u2013 an activity made accessible first through free access to online news content, and subsequently the ability to comment on the content, creating a forum. Erecting a paywall restricts the public's open communication with one another by restricting the ability to both read and share online news.\n\nThe obvious way in which a paywall restricts equal access to the online public sphere is through requiring payment, deterring those who do not want to pay, and barring those who cannot from joining the online discussion. The restriction of equal access was taken to a new extreme when the UK's \"The Independent\" in October 2011 placed a paywall on foreign readers only. Online news media have the proven ability to create global connection beyond the typical reach of a public sphere. In \"Democratizing Global Media,\" Hackett and global communications theorist Yuezhi Zhao describe how a new \"wave of media democratization arises in the era of the internet which has facilitated transnational civil society networks of and for democratic communication.\" By placing a paywall on their international readers, \"The Independent\" hinders the growth and democratic quality of the public sphere created by the internet.\n\nThe use of paywalls has also received many complaints from online news readers regarding an online subscriptions' inability to be shared like a traditional printed paper. While a printed paper can be shared among friends and family, the ethics behind sharing an online subscription are less clear because there is no physical object involved. \"The New York Times\"' \"ethicist\" columnist, Ariel Kaminer, addressing the question of sharing online subscription, states that \"sharing with your spouse or young child is one thing; sharing with friends or family who live elsewhere is another.\" The reader comments following Kaminer's response focus on the dichotomy between paying for a printed paper and paying for an online subscription. A printed paper's ease of access meant that more individuals could read a single copy, and that everyone who read the paper had the ability to send a letter to the editor without the hassle of registering or paying for the subscription. As such, the use of a paywall closes off the communication in both the personal realm and online. This opinion is not just held by online news readers, but also by opinion writers. Jimmy Wales comments that he \"would rather write [an opinion piece] where it is going to be read\", declaring that \"putting opinion pieces behind paywalls [makes] no sense.\" Without easy access to both read and share insights and opinions, the online news platform loses an essential characteristic of democratic exchange.\n\nThe use of a paywall to bar individuals from accessing news content online without payment, brings up numerous ethical questions. According to Hackett, media are already \"failing to furnish citizens with ready access to relevant civic information.\" The implementation of paywalls on previously free news content heightens this failure through intentional withholding. Hackett cites \"general cultural and economic mechanisms, such as the commodification of information and the dependence of commercial media on advertising revenue\" as two of the greatest influences on media performance. According to Hackett, these cultural and economic mechanisms \"generate violations of the democratic norm of equality.\" Implementation of a paywall addresses and intimately ties the two mechanisms cited by Hackett, as the paywall commodifies news content to bring in revenue from both readers and from increased circulation of printed paper's ads. The result of these mechanisms, as stated by Hackett, is an impediment to \"equal access to relevant [news] facts.\"\n\nThe commodification of information\u2013making news into a product that must be purchased\u2013restricts the egalitarian founding principal of the newspaper. Editor's Weblog reporter Katherine Travers, addressing this issue in a post discussing the future of \"The Washington Post\", asks, \"is digital subscription as permissible as charging a couple of dollars now and then for a paper copy?\" While subscription fees have long been attached to print newspapers, all other forms of news have traditionally been free. The UK's \"Daily Mail\" argues that print revenue is unique because \"people pay for the convenience of print in recognition of the special cost of production and delivery of a tangible product and because they purchase it whole.\" Online news, in comparison has existed as a medium of free dissemination. Poynter digital media fellow Jeff Sonderman outlines the ethical tension created by a paywall. Sonderman explains that \"[t]he underlying tension is that newspapers act simultaneously as businesses and as servants of the public\u2019s interest. As for-profit enterprises, they have the right (the duty, even) to make money for shareholders or private owners. But most also claim to have a social compact, in which they safeguard the entire public interest and help their entire community shape and understand its shared values.\" By implementing a paywall before experimenting with other revenue-increasing initiatives, a newspaper arguably puts profit before the public."], "wikipedia-31657187": ["As the popularity of cloud services increases, personalized algorithms used to construct filter bubbles are expected to become more widespread. Scholars have begun considering the effect of filter bubbles on the users of social media from an ethical standpoint, particularly concerning the areas of personal freedom, security, and information bias. Filter bubbles in popular social media and personalized search sites can determine the particular content seen by users, often without their direct consent or cognizance, due to the algorithms used to curate that content. Critics of the use of filter bubbles speculate that individuals may lose autonomy over their own social media experience and have their identities socially constructed as a result of the pervasiveness of filter bubbles.\n\nTechnologists, social media engineers, and computer specialists have also examined the prevalence of filter bubbles. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and Eli Pariser, author of \"The Filter Bubble\", have even expressed concerns regarding the risks of privacy and information polarization. The information of the users of personalized search engines and social media platforms is not private, though some people believe it should be. The concern over privacy has resulted in a debate as to whether or not it is moral for information technologists to take users' online activity and manipulate future exposure to related information.\n\nSince the content seen by individual social media users is influenced by algorithms that produce filter bubbles, users of social media platforms are more susceptible to confirmation bias, and may be exposed to biased, misleading information. Social sorting and other unintentional discriminatory practices are also anticipated as a result of personalized filtering.\n\nIn light of the 2016 U.S. presidential election scholars have likewise expressed concerns about the effect of filter bubbles on democracy and democratic processes, as well as the rise of \"ideological media\". These scholars fear that users will be unable to \"[think] beyond [their] narrow self-interest\" as filter bubbles create personalized social feeds, isolating them from diverse points of view and their surrounding communities. For this reason, it is increasingly discussed the possibility to design social media with more serendipity, that is, to proactively recommend content that lies outside one's filter bubble, including challenging political information and, eventually, to provide empowering filters and tools to users. A related concern is in fact how filter bubbles contribute to the proliferation of \"fake news\" and how this may influence political leaning, including how users vote.\n\nRevelations in March 2018 of Cambridge Analytica's harvesting and use of user data for at least 87 million Facebook profiles during the 2016 presidential election highlight the ethical implications of filter bubbles. Co-Founder and whistleblower of Cambridge Analytica Christopher Wylie, detailed how the firm had the ability to develop \"psychographic\" profiles of those users and use the information to shape their voting behavior. Access to user data by third parties such as Cambridge Analytica can exasperate and amplify existing filter bubbles users have created, artificially increasing existing biases and further divide societies."], "wikipedia-21179478": ["The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is to be honest with the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign. Most social network marketers use websites like Facebook and MySpace to try to drive traffic to another website. While it is ethical to use social networking websites to spread a message to people who are genuinely interested, many people game the system with auto-friend adding programs and spam messages and bulletins. Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.\n\nIn addition, social media platforms have become extremely aware of their users and collect information about their viewers to connect with them in various ways. Social-networking website Facebook Inc. is quietly working on a new advertising system that would let marketers target users with ads based on the massive amounts of information people reveal on the site about themselves. This may be an unethical or ethical feature to some individuals. Some people may react negatively because they believe it is an invasion of privacy. On the other hand, some individuals may enjoy this feature because their social network recognizes their interests and sends them particular advertisements pertaining to those interests. Consumers like to network with people who have interests and desires that are similar to their own. Individuals who agree to have their social media profile public, should be aware that advertisers have the ability to take information that interests them to be able to send them information and advertisements to boost their sales. Managers invest in social media to foster relationships and interact with customers. This is an ethical way for managers to send messages about their advertisements and products to their consumers.\n\nSince social media marketing first came to be, strategists and markets have been getting smarter and more careful with the way they go about collecting information and distributing advertisements. With the presence of data collecting companies, there is no longer a need to target specific audiences. This can be seen as a large ethical gray area. For many users, this is a breach of privacy, but there are no laws that prevent these companies from using the information provided on their websites. Companies like Equifax, Inc., TransUnion Corp, and LexisNexis Group thrive on collecting and sharing personal information of social media users. In 2012, Facebook purchased information from 70 million households from a third party company called Datalogix. Facebook later revealed that they purchased the information in order to create a more efficient advertising service.\n\nFacebook had an estimated 144.27 million views in 2016, approximately 12.9 million per month. Despite this high volume of traffic, very little has been done to protect the millions of users who log on to Facebook and other social media platforms each month. President Barack Obama tried to work with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to attempt to regulate data mining. He proposed the Privacy Bill of Rights, which would protect the average user from having their private information downloaded and shared with third party companies. The proposed laws would give the consumer more control over what information companies can collect. President Obama was unable to pass most of these laws through congress, and it is unsure what President Trump will do with regards to social media marketing ethics."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. **Yes**  \n2.

Of course, user profiling is not a bad thing per se, since it allows to deliver more relevant ad content to the user. However, as targeted ads are believed to produce increased revenues, various intermediary companies (such as ad platforms and ad exchanges) are tracking users at scale, and often in an unregulated manner, which has resulted in a privacy nightmare~\\cite{MyAdChoices_Jagdish16}. Advertising is currently the main business model of ``free'' content and services on the Web, though if something is free it usually means that the user is the product. This dystopian reality evokes a disconcerting dichotomy between, on the one hand, having to accept a digital life with no privacy and, on the other hand, retaining our privacy by being off the digital life. Privacy is essential for the citizens of both the physical and the digital world. But also privacy is constantly being juxtaposed with competing goods and interests, balanced against disparate needs and demands~\\cite{Pozen16}. More importantly, the loss of privacy translates into a loss of freedom.

Solitude refers to the lack of physical proximity of an individual to others. Secrecy refers to the protection of personalized information from being freely distributed.\nIndividuals surrender private information when conducting transactions and registering for services. Ethical business practice protects the privacy of their customers by securing information which may contribute to the loss of secrecy, anonymity, and solitude. Credit card information, social security numbers, phone numbers, mothers' maiden names, addresses and phone numbers freely collected and shared over the internet may lead to a loss of Privacy.\nFraud and impersonation are some of the malicious activities that occur due to the direct or indirect abuse of private information. Identity theft is rising rapidly due to the availability of private information in the internet. For instance, seven million Americans fell victim to identity theft in 2002, and nearly 12 million Americans were victims of identity theft in 2011 making it the fastest growing crime in the United States.\nPublic records search engines and databases are the main culprits contributing to the rise of cybercrime.\n\nEthical debate has long included the concept of property. This concept has created many clashes in the world of cyberethics. One philosophy of the internet is centered around the freedom of information. The controversy over ownership occurs when the property of information is infringed upon or uncertain.\n\nThe ever-increasing speed of the internet and the emergence of compression technology, such as mp3 opened the doors to Peer-to-peer file sharing, a technology that allowed users to anonymously transfer files to each other, previously seen on programs such as Napster or now seen through communications protocol such as BitTorrent. Much of this, however, was copyrighted music and illegal to transfer to other users. Whether it is ethical to transfer copyrighted media is another question.\nProponents of unrestricted file sharing point out how file sharing has given people broader and faster access to media, has increased exposure to new artists, and has reduced the costs of transferring media (including less environmental damage). Supporters of restrictions on file sharing argue that we must protect the income of our artists and other people who work to create our media. This argument is partially answered by pointing to the small proportion of money artists receive from the legitimate sale of media.\n\nWith the introduction of digital rights management software, new issues are raised over whether the subverting of DRM is ethical. Some champion the hackers of DRM as defenders of users' rights, allowing the blind to make audio books of PDFs they receive, allowing people to burn music they have legitimately bought to CD or to transfer it to a new computer. Others see this as nothing but simply a violation of the rights of the intellectual property holders, opening the door to uncompensated use of copyrighted media. Another ethical issue concerning DRMs involves the way these systems could undermine the fair use provisions of the copyright laws. The reason is that these allow content providers to choose who can view or listen to their materials making the discrimination against certain groups possible. In addition, the level of control given to content providers could lead to the invasion of user privacy since the system is able to keep tabs on the personal information and activities of users who access their materials."], "wikipedia-16927210": ["Section::::Ethical implications.:Deterioration of the online public sphere.\nHackett argues that a \"forum on the internet [...] can function as a specialized or smaller-scale public sphere.\" In the past, the internet has been an ideal location for the general public to gather and discuss relevant news issues \u2013 an activity made accessible first through free access to online news content, and subsequently the ability to comment on the content, creating a forum. Erecting a paywall restricts the public's open communication with one another by restricting the ability to both read and share online news.\nThe obvious way in which a paywall restricts equal access to the online public sphere is through requiring payment, deterring those who do not want to pay, and barring those who cannot from joining the online discussion. The restriction of equal access was taken to a new extreme when the UK's \"The Independent\" in October 2011 placed a paywall on foreign readers only. Online news media have the proven ability to create global connection beyond the typical reach of a public sphere. In \"Democratizing Global Media,\" Hackett and global communications theorist Yuezhi Zhao describe how a new \"wave of media democratization arises in the era of the internet which has facilitated transnational civil society networks of and for democratic communication.\" By placing a paywall on their international readers, \"The Independent\" hinders the growth and democratic quality of the public sphere created by the internet.\nThe use of paywalls has also received many complaints from online news readers regarding an online subscriptions' inability to be shared like a traditional printed paper. While a printed paper can be shared among friends and family, the ethics behind sharing an online subscription are less clear because there is no physical object involved. \"The New York Times\"' \"ethicist\" columnist, Ariel Kaminer, addressing the question of sharing online subscription, states that \"sharing with your spouse or young child is one thing; sharing with friends or family who live elsewhere is another.\" The reader comments following Kaminer's response focus on the dichotomy between paying for a printed paper and paying for an online subscription. A printed paper's ease of access meant that more individuals could read a single copy, and that everyone who read the paper had the ability to send a letter to the editor without the hassle of registering or paying for the subscription. As such, the use of a paywall closes off the communication in both the personal realm and online. This opinion is not just held by online news readers, but also by opinion writers. Jimmy Wales comments that he \"would rather write [an opinion piece] where it is going to be read\", declaring that \"putting opinion pieces behind paywalls [makes] no sense.\" Without easy access to both read and share insights and opinions, the online news platform loses an essential characteristic of democratic exchange.\nSection::::Ethical implications.:Paying to stay informed.\nThe use of a paywall to bar individuals from accessing news content online without payment, brings up numerous ethical questions. According to Hackett, media are already \"failing to furnish citizens with ready access to relevant civic information.\" The implementation of paywalls on previously free news content heightens this failure through intentional withholding. Hackett cites \"general cultural and economic mechanisms, such as the commodification of information and the dependence of commercial media on advertising revenue\" as two of the greatest influences on media performance. According to Hackett, these cultural and economic mechanisms \"generate violations of the democratic norm of equality.\" Implementation of a paywall addresses and intimately ties the two mechanisms cited by Hackett, as the paywall commodifies news content to bring in revenue from both readers and from increased circulation of printed paper's ads. The result of these mechanisms, as stated by Hackett, is an impediment to \"equal access to relevant [news] facts.\"\nThe commodification of information\u2013making news into a product that must be purchased\u2013restricts the egalitarian founding principal of the newspaper. Editor's Weblog reporter Katherine Travers, addressing this issue in a post discussing the future of \"The Washington Post\", asks, \"is digital subscription as permissible as charging a couple of dollars now and then for a paper copy?\" While subscription fees have long been attached to print newspapers, all other forms of news have traditionally been free. The UK's \"Daily Mail\" argues that print revenue is unique because \"people pay for the convenience of print in recognition of the special cost of production and delivery of a tangible product and because they purchase it whole.\" Online news, in comparison has existed as a medium of free dissemination. Poynter digital media fellow Jeff Sonderman outlines the ethical tension created by a paywall. Sonderman explains that \"[t]he underlying tension is that newspapers act simultaneously as businesses and as servants of the public\u2019s interest. As for-profit enterprises, they have the right (the duty, even) to make money for shareholders or private owners. But most also claim to have a social compact, in which they safeguard the entire public interest and help their entire community shape and understand its shared values.\" By implementing a paywall before experimenting with other revenue-increasing initiatives, a newspaper arguably puts profit before the public."], "wikipedia-301518": ["BULLET::::- Many leaks and scandals prove how easily normal users are ripped off their personal data - Quid pro quo some might take other data back in exchange.\nBULLET::::- Having bought an obsolete medium like a video cassette with a favorite movie, owners might feel entitled to get a free format conversion upgrade.

It is also concerned with relational issues such as \"the relationship between information and the good of society, the relationship between information providers and the consumers of information\".\n\nInformation technology affects common issues such as copyright protection, intellectual freedom, accountability, privacy, and security. Many of these issues are difficult or impossible to resolve due to fundamental tensions between Western moral philosophies (based on rules, democracy, individual rights, and personal freedoms) and the traditional Eastern cultures (based on relationships, hierarchy, collective responsibilities, and social harmony). The multi-faceted dispute between Google and the government of the People's Republic of China reflects some of these fundamental tensions.\n\nProfessional codes offer a basis for making ethical decisions and applying ethical solutions to situations involving information provision and use which reflect an organization's commitment to responsible information service. Evolving information formats and needs require continual reconsideration of ethical principles and how these codes are applied. Considerations regarding information ethics influence \"personal decisions, professional practice, and public policy\". Therefore, ethical analysis must provide a framework to take into consideration \"many, diverse domains\" (ibid.) regarding how information is distributed.\n\nEthical concerns regarding international security, surveillance, and the right to privacy are on the rise. The issues of security and privacy commonly overlap in the field of information, due to the interconnectedness of online research and the development of Information Technology (IT). Some of the areas surrounding security and privacy are identity theft, online economic transfers, medical records, and state security.

This concern dates back to the early days of the publicly accessible Internet, with the term \"cyberbalkanization\" being coined in 1996.\n\nIn news media, echo chamber is a metaphorical description of a situation in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system. By visiting an \"echo chamber\", people are able to seek out information which reinforces their existing views, potentially as an unconscious exercise of confirmation bias. This may increase political and social polarization and extremism.The term is a metaphor based on the acoustic echo chamber, where sounds reverberate in a hollow enclosure.\n\nBarack Obama's farewell address identified a similar concept to filter bubbles as a \"threat to [Americans'] democracy\", i.e., the \"retreat into our own bubbles, ...especially our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions... And increasingly we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it's true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.\"", "As the popularity of cloud services increases, personalized algorithms used to construct filter bubbles are expected to become more widespread. Scholars have begun considering the effect of filter bubbles on the users of social media from an ethical standpoint, particularly concerning the areas of personal freedom, security, and information bias. Filter bubbles in popular social media and personalized search sites can determine the particular content seen by users, often without their direct consent or cognizance, due to the algorithms used to curate that content. Critics of the use of filter bubbles speculate that individuals may lose autonomy over their own social media experience and have their identities socially constructed as a result of the pervasiveness of filter bubbles.\nTechnologists, social media engineers, and computer specialists have also examined the prevalence of filter bubbles. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and Eli Pariser, author of \"The Filter Bubble\", have even expressed concerns regarding the risks of privacy and information polarization. The information of the users of personalized search engines and social media platforms is not private, though some people believe it should be. The concern over privacy has resulted in a debate as to whether or not it is moral for information technologists to take users' online activity and manipulate future exposure to related information.\nSince the content seen by individual social media users is influenced by algorithms that produce filter bubbles, users of social media platforms are more susceptible to confirmation bias, and may be exposed to biased, misleading information. Social sorting and other unintentional discriminatory practices are also anticipated as a result of personalized filtering.\nIn light of the 2016 U.S. presidential election scholars have likewise expressed concerns about the effect of filter bubbles on democracy and democratic processes, as well as the rise of \"ideological media\". These scholars fear that users will be unable to \"[think] beyond [their] narrow self-interest\" as filter bubbles create personalized social feeds, isolating them from diverse points of view and their surrounding communities. For this reason, it is increasingly discussed the possibility to design social media with more serendipity, that is, to proactively recommend content that lies outside one's filter bubble, including challenging political information and, eventually, to provide empowering filters and tools to users. A related concern is in fact how filter bubbles contribute to the proliferation of \"fake news\" and how this may influence political leaning, including how users vote.\nRevelations in March 2018 of Cambridge Analytica's harvesting and use of user data for at least 87 million Facebook profiles during the 2016 presidential election highlight the ethical implications of filter bubbles. Co-Founder and whistleblower of Cambridge Analytica Christopher Wylie, detailed how the firm had the ability to develop \"psychographic\" profiles of those users and use the information to shape their voting behavior. Access to user data by third parties such as Cambridge Analytica can exasperate and amplify existing filter bubbles users have created, artificially increasing existing biases and further divide societies."], "wikipedia-55639999": ["Section::::The Four Major Fields of Focus.:Ethics.\nEthics considers whether the norms, rules and procedures that govern online behavior and the design of the Internet and related digital media are based on ethical principles anchored in human rights based principles and geared to protecting the dignity and safety of individuals in cyberspace and advance accessibility, openness, and inclusiveness on the Internet. For example, Internet use should be sensitive to ethical considerations, such as non-discrimination on the basis of gender, age or disabilities; and shaped by ethics rather than used to retrospectively justify practices and policies, placing a focus on the intentionality of actions, as well as on the outcomes of Internet policies and practices.\n\nSection::::Challenges to Internet Universality.:User Targeting and Profiling.\nGovernments or commercial enterprises have the ability to target individual users, putting their privacy in danger, given that they will know much about their interests through their search or other online activities. Individual users of social media platforms can advertise to others who are interested in particular topics. This can appear more as a violation of privacy then the exercise of free speech. A related issue is the \u2018filter bubble\u2019: the idea that different Internet users will see different versions of the Internet, based on how algorithms use their previous search or social media preferences. User targeting can happen at the level of the government, private companies, or even at the infrastructural level.\n\nSection::::Challenges to Internet Universality.:Data protection and surveillance.\nData protection can be critical to free expression. Increasing government surveillance of citizens, including through the collection and analysis of \u2018big data\u2019, is leading to an erosion of the citizens' rights to privacy and freedom of expression.

These pages may include explanations of potential risks like data breaches, surveillance, profiling, and unauthorized data sharing. Additionally, some Wikipedia articles may offer real-world examples or cases that illustrate these risks, though they may not always be comprehensive or detailed.", "wikipedia-60583225": ["With the emergence and popularity of location-based services, people are getting more personalized services, such as getting the names and locations of nearby restaurants and gas stations. Receiving these services requires users to send their positions either directly or indirectly to the service provider. A user's location information could be shared more than 5000 times in two weeks. Therefore, this convenience also exposes users\u2019 privacy to certain risks, since the attackers may illegally identify the users\u2019 locations and even further exploit their personal information. Continuously tracking users' location has not only been identified as a technical issue, but also a privacy concern as well. It has been realized that Quasi-identifiers, which refer to a set of information attributes, can be used to re-identify the user when linked with some external information. For example, the social security number could be used to identify a specific user by adversaries, and the combined disclosure of birth date, zip code, and gender can uniquely identify a user. In recent years, researchers have been making a connection between social aspects and technological aspects regarding location information. For example, if co-location information is considered as the data which potential attackers would get and take into consideration, the location privacy is decreased by more than 60%. Also, by a constant report of a user's location information, a movement profile could be constructed for this specific user based on statistical analysis, and a large amount of information could be exploited and generated from this profile such as user's office location, medical records, financial status, and political views.", "and the development of wireless communication which are introduced in the extensive use of location-based applications, high risks have been placed on user privacy. Both the service providers and users are under the dangers of being attacked and information being abused. It has been reported that some GPS devices have been used to exploit personal information and stalk personal locations. Sometimes, only reporting location information would already indicate much private information. One of the attacks specific to location-based services is the space or time correlated inference attacks, in which the visited location is correlated with the particular time, and this could lead to the disclosure of private life and private business.\nContinuous location-based services require a constant report of location information to the service providers. During the process of requesting a continuous location-based service, pressure has been recognized on privacy leakage issues. Since the a series of cloaked areas are reported, with the advancing technological performances, a correlation could be generated between the blurred regions.\nFirst, the two schemes of spatial cloaking both have their limitations. For example, in the centralized scheme, although users' other private information including identity has been cloaked, the location itself would be able to release sensitive information, especially when a specific user requests service for multiple times with the same pseudonym. In a decentralized scheme, there are issues with large computation and not enough peers in a region.\nDuring the process of exchanging data, the three main parties\u2014the user, the server, and the networks\u2014can be attacked by adversaries. The knowledge held by adversaries which could be used to carry out location attacks includes observed location information, precise location information, and context knowledge. The techniques of machine learning and big data have also led to an emerging trend in location privacy, and the popularity of smart devices has led to an increasing number of attacks. Some of the adopted approaches include the virus, the Trojan applications, and several cyber-attacks.\nBULLET::::- Man-in-the-middle attack\nMan-in-the-middle attacks usually occur in the mobile environment which assumes that all the information going through the transferring process from user to the service provider could be under attacks and might be manipulated further by attackers revealing more personal information.\nBULLET::::- Cross-service attack\nCross-servicing attacks usually take place when users are using poorly protected wireless connectivity, especially in public places.\nBULLET::::- Video-based attack\nVideo-based attacks are more prevalent in mobile devices usually due to the use of Bluetooth, camera, and video capacities, since there are malicious software applications secretly recording users\u2019 behavior data and reporting that information to a remote device. Stealthy Video Capture is one of the intentionally designed applications which spies an unconscious user and further report the information.\nBULLET::::- Sensor sniffing attack\nSensor sniffing attacks usually refer to the cases where intentionally designed applications are installed on a device. Under this situation, even adversaries do not have physical contact with the mobile device, users\u2019 personal information would still under risks of being disclosed.\nBULLET::::- Context linking attack\nIn a localization attack, contextual knowledge is combined with observed location information to disclose a precise location. The contextual knowledge can also be combined with precise location information to carry out identity attacks.\nBULLET::::- Machine/deep learning attack\nIntegrating learning algorithms and other deep learning methods are posing a huge challenge to location privacy, along with the massive amount of data online. For example, current deep learning methods can come up with predictions about geolocations based on the personal photos from social networks and performs types of object detection based on their abilities to analyze millions of photos and videos.", "Even though many privacy preserving mechanisms have not been integrated into common use due to effectiveness, efficiency, and practicality, some location-based service providers have started to address privacy issues in their applications. For example, Twitter enables its users to customize location accuracy. Locations posted in Glympse will automatically expire. Also, SocialRadar allows its users to choose to be anonymous or invisible when using this application.\n\nIt has been arguing that less than a week after Facebook uses its \u201cPlaces\u201d feature, the content of that location information has been exploited by thieves and are used to conduct a home invasion."], "wikipedia-1228060": ["Internet privacy involves the right or mandate of personal privacy concerning the storing, repurposing, provision to third parties, and displaying of information pertaining to oneself via the Internet. Privacy concerns have been articulated from the beginnings of large-scale computer sharing.\nPrivacy can entail either \"Personally Identifying Information\" (PII) or non-PII information such as a site visitor's behavior on a website. PII refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual. For example, age and physical address alone could identify who an individual is without explicitly disclosing their name, as these two factors are unique enough to identify a specific person typically. Other forms of PII may soon include GPS Tracking Data used by Apps, as the daily commute and routine information can be enough to identify an individual.\n\nCompanies are hired to watch what websites people visit, and then use the information, for instance by sending advertising based on one's web browsing history. Moreover, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer potentially more intrusive details about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.\n\nThose concerned about Internet privacy often cite a number of \"privacy risks\" \u2014 events that can compromise privacy \u2014 which may be encountered through Internet use. These range from the gathering of statistics on users to more malicious acts such as the spreading of spyware and the exploitation of various forms of bugs (software faults).\n\nIn late 2007 Facebook launched the Beacon program where user rental records were released on the public for friends to see. Many people were enraged by this breach in privacy, and the \"Lane v. Facebook, Inc.\" case ensued.\n\nChildren and adolescents often use the Internet (including social media) in ways which risk their privacy: a cause for growing concern among parents. Young people also may not realise that all their information and browsing can and may be tracked while visiting a particular site and that it is up to them to protect their own privacy. They must be informed about all these risks. For example, on Twitter, threats include shortened links that lead one to potentially harmful places. In their email inbox, threats include email scams and attachments that get them to install malware and disclose personal information. On Torrent sites, threats include malware hiding in video, music, and software downloads. Even when using a smartphone, threats include geolocation, meaning that one's phone can detect where they are and post it online for all to see.\n\nAn HTTP cookie is data stored on a user's computer that assists in automated access to websites or web features, or other state information required in complex web sites. It may also be used for user-tracking by storing special usage history data in a cookie, and such cookies\u2014for example, those used by Google Analytics\u2014are called \"tracking cookies\". Cookies are a common concern in the field of Internet privacy. Although website developers most commonly use cookies for legitimate technical purposes, cases of abuse occur. In 2009, two researchers noted that social networking profiles could be connected to cookies, allowing the social networking profile to be connected to browsing habits.\n\nTracking cookies and especially third-party tracking cookies are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories \u2014 a privacy concern that prompted European and US lawmakers to take action in 2011.", "The original developers of cookies intended that only the website that originally distributed cookies to users could retrieve them, therefore returning only data already possessed by the website. However, in practice programmers can circumvent this restriction. Possible consequences include:\n- the placing of a personally-identifiable tag in a browser to facilitate Web profiling , or\n- use of cross-site scripting or other techniques to steal information from a user's cookies.\n\nCookies are mostly harmless except for third-party cookies. These cookies are not made by the website itself, but by web banner advertising companies. These third-party cookies are so dangerous because they take the same information that regular cookies do, such as browsing habits and frequently visited websites, but then they give out this information to other companies.\n\nThe process of \"profiling\" (also known as \"tracking\") assembles and analyzes several events, each attributable to a single originating entity, in order to gain information (especially patterns of activity) relating to the originating entity. Some organizations engage in the profiling of people's web browsing, collecting the URLs of sites visited. The resulting profiles can potentially link with information that personally identifies the individual who did the browsing.\n\nProfiling becomes a more contentious privacy issue when data-matching associates the profile of an individual with personally-identifiable information of the individual.\n\nGovernments and organizations may set up honeypot websites \u2013 featuring controversial topics \u2013 with the purpose of attracting and tracking unwary people. This constitutes a potential danger for individuals.\n\nWhen some users choose to disable HTTP cookie to reduce privacy risks as noted, new types of cookies were invented: since cookies are advertisers' main way of targeting potential customers, and some customers were deleting cookies, some advertisers started to use persistent Flash cookies and zombie cookies. In a 2009 study, Flash cookies were found to be a popular mechanism for storing data on the top 100 most visited sites. Another 2011 study of social media found that, \u201cOf the top 100 web sites, 31 had at least one overlap between HTTP and Flash cookies.\u201d\n\nFlash cookies, also known as Local Shared Objects, work the same ways as normal cookies and are used by the Adobe Flash Player to store information at the user's computer. They exhibit a similar privacy risk as normal cookies, but are not as easily blocked, meaning that the option in most browsers to not accept cookies does not affect Flash cookies.\n\nEvercookies, created by Samy Kamkar, are JavaScript-based applications which produce cookies in a web browser that actively \"resist\" deletion by redundantly copying themselves in different forms on the user's machine (e.g., Flash Local Shared Objects, various HTML5 storage mechanisms, window.name caching, etc.), and resurrecting copies that are missing or expired.\n\nEvercookies enable advertisers to continue to track a customer regardless of if one deletes their cookies or not.\n\nDevice fingerprinting uses data from the device and browser sessions to determine the risk of conducting business with the person using the device. It is difficult to surf the web without being tracked by device fingerprinting today.", "Sentinel Advanced Detection Analysis and Predator Tracking (A.D.A.P.T.) is device fingerprinting software technology that identifies the device (computer, tablet, smartphone, ...) being used to access a website. This information, in turn, can be used to help differentiate legitimate users from those using false identities or those attempting to work anonymously. A.D.A.P.T. uses only HTTP and JavaScript to identify a device and identifies devices without requesting any personal information entered directly by the user. It makes an accurate \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the device by using many different pieces of information including, operating system, browser, and PC characteristics. A.D.A.P.T. is concealed in that the user of the device has no idea that the device is being \u201cfingerprinted\u201d and there is no actual tagging of the device.\nCanvas fingerprinting is one of a number of browser fingerprinting techniques of tracking online users that allow websites to uniquely identify and track visitors using HTML5 canvas element instead of browser cookies or other similar means.\nFace recognition technology can be used to gain access to a person's private data, according to a new study. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University combined image scanning, cloud computing and public profiles from social network sites to identify individuals in the offline world. Data captured even included a user's social security number. Experts have warned of the privacy risks faced by the increased merging of our online and offline identities. The researchers have also developed an 'augmented reality' mobile app that can display personal data over a person's image captured on a smartphone screen. Since these technologies are widely available, our future identities may become exposed to anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. Researchers believe this could force us to reconsider our future attitudes to privacy.\nPersonal information can be revealed through searches by the user's computer, account, or IP address being linked to the search terms used. Search engines have claimed a necessity to retain such information in order to provide better services, protect against security pressure, and protect against fraud. A search engine takes all of its users and assigns each one a specific ID number. Those in control of the database often keep records of where on the Internet each member has traveled to. AOL's system is one example. AOL has a database 21 million members deep, each with their own specific ID number. The way that AOLSearch is set up, however, allows for AOL to keep records of all the websites visited by any given member. Even though the true identity of the user isn't known, a full profile of a member can be made just by using the information stored by AOLSearch. By keeping records of what people query through AOLSearch, the company is able to learn a great deal about them without knowing their names.", "Which information an ISP collects, what it does with that information, and whether it informs its consumers, pose significant privacy issues. Beyond the usage of collected information typical of third parties, ISPs sometimes state that they will make their information available to government authorities upon request. In the US and other countries, such a request does not necessarily require a warrant.\nHTML5 expands the number of methods given to a website to store information locally on a client as well as the amount of data that can be stored. As such, privacy risks are increased. For instance, merely erasing cookies may not be enough to remove potential tracking methods since data could be mirrored in web storage, another means of keeping information in a user's web browser. There are so many sources of data storage that it is challenging for web browsers to present sensible privacy settings.\nHTML5 also expands access to user media, potentially granting access to a computer's microphone or webcam, a capability previously only possible through the use of plug-ins like Flash. It is also possible to find a user's geographical location using the geolocation API. With this expanded access comes increased potential for abuse as well as more vectors for attackers. If a malicious site was able to gain access to a user's media, it could potentially use recordings to uncover sensitive information thought to be unexposed.\nBig Data provides companies with the ability to:\n- Infer detailed psycho-demographic profiles of internet users, even if they were not directly expressed or indicated by users.\n- Use clickstream analysis and data mining to detect fraudulent behavior.\n- Analyze data from social media to detect new market trends and changes in demand.\n- Send tailored recommendations to mobile devices at just the right time, while customers are in the right location to take advantage of offers.\n- Mine customer data for insight, and create advertising strategies for customer acquisition and retention.\n- Determine root causes of failures, issues and defects by investigating user sessions, network logs and machine sensors.\nOther potential Internet privacy risks:\n- Spyware is a piece of software that obtains information from a user's computer without that user's consent.\n- A web bug is an object embedded into a web page or email and is usually invisible to the user of the website or reader of the email. It allows checking to see if a person has looked at a particular website or read a specific email message.\n- Phishing is a criminally fraudulent process of trying to obtain sensitive information such as user names, passwords, credit card or bank information.\n- Pharming is a hacker's attempt to redirect traffic from a legitimate website to a completely different internet address.\n- Social engineering where people are manipulated or tricked into performing actions or divulging confidential information."], "wikipedia-59012195": ["This collection of user data can also be seen as an overreach by private companies for their own financial gain or as an intrusive surveillance tactic. Search engines can make money using targeted advertising because advertisers are willing to pay a premium to present their ads to the most receptive consumers. Also, when a search engine collects and catalogs large amounts of data about its users, there is the potential for it to be leaked accidentally or breached. The government can also subpoena user data from search engines when they have databases of it. Search query database information may also be subpoenaed by private litigants for use in civil cases, such as divorces or employment disputes.\n\nOne major controversy regarding search engine privacy was the AOL search data leak of 2006. For academic and research purposes, AOL made public a list of about 20 million search queries made by about 650,000 unique users. Although they assigned unique identification numbers to the users instead of attaching names to each query, it was still possible to ascertain the true identities of many users simply by analyzing what they had searched, including locations near them and names of friends and family members. A notable example of this was how the New York Times identified Thelma Arnold through \"reverse searching\". Users also sometimes do \"ego searches\" where they search themselves to see what information about them is on the internet, making it even easier to identify supposedly anonymous users. Many of the search queries released by AOL were incriminating or seemingly extremely private, such as \"how to kill your wife\" and \"can you adopt after a suicide attempt\". This data has since been used in several experiments that attempt to measure the effectiveness of user privacy solutions.\n\nYahoo is known for being the subject of multiple breaches and hacks that have compromised large amounts of user data. As of late 2016, Yahoo had announced that at least 1.5 billion user accounts had been breached during 2013 and 2014. The breach of 2013 compromised over a billion accounts while the breach of 2014 included about 500 million accounts. The data compromised in the breaches included personally identifiable information such as phone numbers, email addresses, and birth dates as well as information like security questions (used to reset passwords) and encrypted passwords. Yahoo made a statement saying that their breaches were a result of state sponsored actors, and in 2017, two Russian intelligence officers were indicted by the United States Department of Justice as part of a conspiracy to hack Yahoo and steal user data.\n\nThe government may want to subpoena user data from search engines for any number of reasons, which is why it a big threat to user privacy. In 2006, they wanted it as part of their defense of COPA, and only Google refused to comply. While protecting the online privacy of children may be an honorable goal, there are concerns about whether the government should have access to such personal data to achieve it. At other times, they may want it for national security purposes; access to big databases of search queries in order to prevent terrorist attacks is a common example of this. Whatever the reason, it is clear that the fact that search engines do create and maintain these databases of user data is what makes it possible for the government to access it."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This technology has been used successfully to inform usability tests, predict user engagement and intent, detect searcher frustration, and infer user attention to parts of a web page, among other tasks. Unfortunately, because mouse cursor tracking can be performed unobtrusively and at scale, it has opened the door to a brand new wave of massive tracking campaigns and companies that hide behind laudable objectives, such as providing fine-grained, in-page analytics (e.g., hovered and clicked items, scroll reach, speed of browsing) to the website owners.

Of course, user profiling is not a bad thing per se, since it allows to deliver more relevant ad content to the user. However, as targeted ads are believed to produce increased revenues, various intermediary companies (such as ad platforms and ad exchanges) are tracking users at scale, and often in an unregulated manner, which has resulted in a privacy nightmare~\\cite{MyAdChoices_Jagdish16}. Advertising is currently the main business model of ``free'' content and services on the Web, though if something is free it usually means that the user is the product. This dystopian reality evokes a disconcerting dichotomy between, on the one hand, having to accept a digital life with no privacy and, on the other hand, retaining our privacy by being off the digital life. Privacy is essential for the citizens of both the physical and the digital world. But also privacy is constantly being juxtaposed with competing goods and interests, balanced against disparate needs and demands~\\cite{Pozen16}. More importantly, the loss of privacy translates into a loss of freedom. In other words, freedom of expression is threatened by the surveillance of our digital traces; thought patterns and intentions can be extrapolated from website visits (rightly or wrongly), and the knowledge that we are being surveyed can make one less likely to research a particular topic.\\footnote{\\url{https://robindoherty.com/2016/01/06/nothing-to-hide.html}} And even efforts to regulate the web tracking landscape, such as the DNT Header, require good faith cooperation from the parties at the other end of the web connection, which is not always guaranteed.

However, the cookie-based approach remains to this day the dominant one, since it is fully supported by all web browsers. With a cookie identifying the user's browser, a third party domain can track the user activity across websites using redirection techniques or providing a free service that makes cross-domain tracking possible, such as the Facebook `Like' button or social media sharing plugins for WordPress. Then, by analyzing the content of the browsed websites, the tracking domain can effortlessly -- and at an unprecedented scale -- derive users' intentions and interests, alongside with other sensitive profiling information~\\cite{Iordanou2019WhosTS, Ren_2016}. There is a plethora of work that capitalize on user profiling based on how we browse. For example, our browsing history is used to detect targeted ads~\\cite{Carrascosa_2015, MyAdChoices_Jagdish16} or even identify which attribute or user action triggered a specific ad~\\cite{xray, Wills_2012}. Olejnik et al.~\\cite{Olejnik12} noticed that, with just 4 visited websites, it is possible to uniquely identify users in 97\\% of cases.

However, the research literature on mouse cursor tracking has pointed out far more advanced and creative use cases for this technology. The above studies demonstrate that certain cognitive and motor control mechanisms are embodied and reflected, to some extent, in our mouse cursor movements and online interactions.

They exhibit a similar privacy risk as normal cookies, but are not as easily blocked, meaning that the option in most browsers to not accept cookies does not affect Flash cookies.\nEvercookies, created by Samy Kamkar, are JavaScript-based applications which produce cookies in a web browser that actively \"resist\" deletion by redundantly copying themselves in different forms on the user's machine (e.g., Flash Local Shared Objects, various HTML5 storage mechanisms, window.name caching, etc.), and resurrecting copies that are missing or expired.\nDevice fingerprinting is a fairly new technology that is useful in fraud prevention and safeguarding any information from one's computer. Device fingerprinting uses data from the device and browser sessions to determine the risk of conducting business with the person using the device.", "Section::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Device fingerprinting.:Sentinel Advanced Detection Analysis and Predator Tracking (A.D.A.P.T.).\nSentinel Advanced Detection Analysis and Predator Tracking (A.D.A.P.T.) is device fingerprinting software technology that identifies the device (computer, tablet, smartphone, ...) being used to access a website. This information, in turn, can be used to help differentiate legitimate users from those using false identities or those attempting to work anonymously. A.D.A.P.T. uses only HTTP and JavaScript to identify a device and identifies devices without requesting any personal information entered directly by the user. It makes an accurate \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the device by using many different pieces of information including, operating system, browser, and PC characteristics. A.D.A.P.T. is concealed in that the user of the device has no idea that the device is being \u201cfingerprinted\u201d and there is no actual tagging of the device.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Device fingerprinting.:Canvas fingerprinting.\nCanvas fingerprinting is one of a number of browser fingerprinting techniques of tracking online users that allow websites to uniquely identify and track visitors using HTML5 canvas element instead of browser cookies or other similar means.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Photographs on the Internet.\nToday many people have digital cameras and post their photographs online, for example street photography practitioners do so for artistic purposes and social documentary photography practitioners do so to document the common people in everyday life. The people depicted in these photos might not want to have them appear on the Internet. Police arrest photos, considered public record in many jurisdictions, are often posted on the internet by numerous online mug shot publishing sites.\nSome organizations attempt to respond to this privacy-related concern. For example, the 2005 Wikimania conference required that photographers have the prior permission of the people in their pictures, albeit this made it impossible for photographers to practice candid photography and doing the same in a public place would violate the photographers' free speech rights. Some people wore a \"no photos\" tag to indicate they would prefer not to have their photo taken .\nThe \"Harvard Law Review\" published a short piece called \"In The Face of Danger: Facial Recognition and Privacy Law\", much of it explaining how \"privacy law, in its current form, is of no help to those unwillingly tagged.\" Any individual can be unwillingly tagged in a photo and displayed in a manner that might violate them personally in some way, and by the time Facebook gets to taking down the photo, many people will have already had the chance to view, share, or distribute it. Furthermore, traditional tort law does not protect people who are captured by a photograph in public because this is not counted as an invasion of privacy. The extensive Facebook privacy policy covers these concerns and much more. For example, the policy states that they reserve the right to disclose member information or share photos with companies, lawyers, courts, government entities, etc. if they feel it absolutely necessary. The policy also informs users that profile pictures are mainly to help friends connect to each other. However, these, as well as other pictures, can allow other people to invade a person's privacy by finding out information that can be used to track and locate a certain individual. In an article featured in ABC News, it was stated that two teams of scientists found out that Hollywood stars could be giving up information about their private whereabouts very easily through pictures uploaded to the Internet. Moreover, it was found that pictures taken by some phones and tablets including iPhones automatically attach the latitude and longitude of the picture taken through metadata unless this function is manually disabled.\nFace recognition technology can be used to gain access to a person's private data, according to a new study. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University combined image scanning, cloud computing and public profiles from social network sites to identify individuals in the offline world. Data captured even included a user's social security number. Experts have warned of the privacy risks faced by the increased merging of our online and offline identities. The researchers have also developed an 'augmented reality' mobile app that can display personal data over a person's image captured on a smartphone screen. Since these technologies are widely available, our future identities may become exposed to anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. Researchers believe this could force us to reconsider our future attitudes to privacy.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Photographs on the Internet.:Google Street View.\nGoogle Street View, released in the U.S. in 2007, is currently the subject of an ongoing debate about possible infringement on individual privacy. In an article entitled \u201cPrivacy, Reconsidered: New Representations, Data Practices, and the Geoweb\u201d, Sarah Elwood and Agnieszka Leszczynski (2011) argue that Google Street View \u201cfacilitate[s] identification and disclosure with more immediacy and less abstraction.\u201d The medium through which Street View disseminates information, the photograph, is very immediate in the sense that it can potentially provide direct information and evidence about a person's whereabouts, activities, and private property. Moreover, the technology's disclosure of information about a person is less abstract in the sense that, if photographed, a person is represented on Street View in a virtual replication of his or her own real-life appearance. In other words, the technology removes abstractions of a person's appearance or that of his or her personal belongings \u2013 there is an immediate disclosure of the person and object, as they visually exist in real life. Although Street View began to blur license plates and people's faces in 2008, the technology is faulty and does not entirely ensure against accidental disclosure of identity and private property. Elwood and Leszczynski note that \u201cmany of the concerns leveled at Street View stem from situations where its photograph-like images were treated as definitive evidence of an individual\u2019s involvement in particular activities.\u201d In one instance, Ruedi Noser, a Swiss politician, barely avoided public scandal when he was photographed in 2009 on Google Street View walking with a woman who was not his wife \u2013 the woman was actually his secretary. Similar situations occur when Street View provides high-resolution photographs \u2013 and photographs hypothetically offer compelling objective evidence. But as the case of the Swiss politician illustrates, even supposedly compelling photographic evidence is sometimes subject to gross misinterpretation. This example further suggests that Google Street View may provide opportunities for privacy infringement and harassment through public dissemination of the photographs. Google Street View does, however, blur or remove photographs of individuals and private property from image frames if the individuals request further blurring and/or removal of the images. This request can be submitted, for review, through the \u201creport a problem\u201d button that is located on the bottom left-hand side of every image window on Google Street View, however, Google has made attempts to report a problem difficult by disabling the \"Why are you reporting the street view\" icon.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Search engines.\nSearch engines have the ability to track a user's searches. Personal information can be revealed through searches by the user's computer, account, or IP address being linked to the search terms used. Search engines have claimed a necessity to retain such information in order to provide better services, protect against security pressure, and protect against fraud.\nA search engine takes all of its users and assigns each one a specific ID number. Those in control of the database often keep records of where on the Internet each member has traveled to. AOL's system is one example. AOL has a database 21 million members deep, each with their own specific ID number. The way that AOLSearch is set up, however, allows for AOL to keep records of all the websites visited by any given member. Even though the true identity of the user isn't known, a full profile of a member can be made just by using the information stored by AOLSearch. By keeping records of what people query through AOLSearch, the company is able to learn a great deal about them without knowing their names.\nSearch engines also are able to retain user information, such as location and time spent using the search engine, for up to ninety days. Most search engine operators use the data to get a sense of which needs must be met in certain areas of their field. People working in the legal field are also allowed to use information collected from these search engine websites. The Google search engine is given as an example of a search engine that retains the information entered for a period of three-fourths of a year before it becomes obsolete for public usage. Yahoo! follows in the footsteps of Google in the sense that it also deletes user information after a period of ninety days. Other search engines such as Ask! search engine has promoted a tool of \"AskEraser\" which essentially takes away personal information when requested.\nSome changes made to Internet search engines included that of Google's search engine. Beginning in 2009, Google began to run a new system where the Google search became personalized. The item that is searched and the results that are shown remembers previous information that pertains to the individual. Google search engine not only seeks what is searched, but also strives to allow the user to feel like the search engine recognizes their interests. This is achieved by using online advertising. A system that Google uses to filter advertisements and search results that might interest the user is by having a ranking system that tests relevancy that include observation of the behavior users exude while searching on Google. Another function of search engines is the predictability of location. Search engines are able to predict where one's location is currently by locating IP Addresses and geographical locations.", "Users and public officials have raised many concerns regarding Google's new privacy policy. The main concern/issue involves the sharing of data from multiple sources. Because this policy gathers all information and data searched from multiple engines when logged into Google, and uses it to help assist users, privacy becomes an important element. Public officials and Google account users are worried about online safety because of all this information being gathered from multiple sources.\n\nSome users do not like the overlapping privacy policy, wishing to keep the service of Google separate. The update to Google's privacy policy has alarmed both public and private sectors. The European Union has asked Google to delay the onset of the new privacy policy in order to ensure that it does not violate E.U. law. This move is in accordance with objections to decreasing online privacy raised in other foreign nations where surveillance is more heavily scrutinized. Canada and Germany have both held investigations into the legality of both Facebook, against respective privacy acts, in 2010. The new privacy policy only heightens unresolved concerns regarding user privacy.\n\nAn additional feature of concern to the new Google privacy policy is the nature of the policy. One must accept all features or delete existing Google accounts. The update will affect the Google+ social network, therefore making Google+\u2019s settings uncustomizable, unlike other customizable social networking sites. Customizing the privacy settings of a social network is a key tactic that many feel is necessary for social networking sites. This update in the system has some Google+ users wary of continuing service. Additionally, some fear the sharing of data amongst Google services could lead to revelations of identities. Many using pseudonyms are concerned about this possibility, and defend the role of pseudonyms in literature and history.\n\nIn 2013 a class action lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user messages for web links, translating them to \u201clikes\u201d on the user's Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. \"Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA also referred to as the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code,\" the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open.", "Section::::Risks to Internet privacy.:HTML5.\nHTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language specification. HTML defines how user agents, such as web browsers, are to present websites based upon their underlying code. This new web standard changes the way that users are affected by the internet and their privacy on the internet. HTML5 expands the number of methods given to a website to store information locally on a client as well as the amount of data that can be stored. As such, privacy risks are increased. For instance, merely erasing cookies may not be enough to remove potential tracking methods since data could be mirrored in web storage, another means of keeping information in a user's web browser. There are so many sources of data storage that it is challenging for web browsers to present sensible privacy settings. As the power of web standards increases, so do potential misuses.\nHTML5 also expands access to user media, potentially granting access to a computer's microphone or webcam, a capability previously only possible through the use of plug-ins like Flash. It is also possible to find a user's geographical location using the geolocation API. With this expanded access comes increased potential for abuse as well as more vectors for attackers. If a malicious site was able to gain access to a user's media, it could potentially use recordings to uncover sensitive information thought to be unexposed. However, the World Wide Web Consortium, responsible for many web standards, feels that the increased capabilities of the web platform outweigh potential privacy concerns. They state that by documenting new capabilities in an open standardization process, rather than through closed source plug-ins made by companies, it is easier to spot flaws in specifications and cultivate expert advice.\nBesides elevating privacy concerns, HTML5 also adds a few tools to enhance user privacy. A mechanism is defined whereby user agents can share blacklists of domains that should not be allowed to access web storage. Content Security Policy is a proposed standard whereby sites may assign privileges to different domains, enforcing harsh limitations on JavaScript use to mitigate cross-site scripting attacks. HTML5 also adds HTML templating and a standard HTML parser which replaces the various parsers of web browser vendors. These new features formalize previously inconsistent implementations, reducing the number of vulnerabilities though not eliminating them entirely.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Big Data.\nBig Data is generally defined as the rapid accumulation and compiling of massive amounts of information that is being exchanged over digital communication systems. The data is large (often exceeding exabytes) and cannot be handled by conventional computer processors, and are instead stored on large server-system databases. This information is assessed by analytic scientists using software programs; which paraphrase this information into multi-layered user trends and demographics. This information is collected from all around the Internet, such as by popular services like Facebook, Google, Apple, Spotify or GPS systems. \nBig Data provides companies with the ability to:\nBULLET::::- Infer detailed psycho-demographic profiles of internet users, even if they were not directly expressed or indicated by users.\nBULLET::::- Inspect product availability and optimize prices for maximum profit while clearing inventory.\nBULLET::::- Swiftly reconfigure risk portfolios in minutes and understand future opportunities to mitigate risk.\nBULLET::::- Mine customer data for insight, and create advertising strategies for customer acquisition and retention.\nBULLET::::- Identify customers who matter the most.\nBULLET::::- Create retail coupons based on a proportional scale to how much the customer has spent, to ensure a higher redemption rate.\nBULLET::::- Send tailored recommendations to mobile devices at just the right time, while customers are in the right location to take advantage of offers.\nBULLET::::- Analyze data from social media to detect new market trends and changes in demand.\nBULLET::::- Use clickstream analysis and data mining to detect fraudulent behavior.\nBULLET::::- Determine root causes of failures, issues and defects by investigating user sessions, network logs and machine sensors.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Other potential Internet privacy risks.\nBULLET::::- Malware is a term short for \"malicious software\" and is used to describe software to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network whether that is through the use of a virus, trojan horse, spyware, etc.\nBULLET::::- Spyware is a piece of software that obtains information from a user's computer without that user's consent.\nBULLET::::- A web bug is an object embedded into a web page or email and is usually invisible to the user of the website or reader of the email. It allows checking to see if a person has looked at a particular website or read a specific email message.\nBULLET::::- Phishing is a criminally fraudulent process of trying to obtain sensitive information such as user names, passwords, credit card or bank information. Phishing is an internet crime in which someone masquerades as a trustworthy entity in some form of electronic communication.\nBULLET::::- Pharming is a hacker's attempt to redirect traffic from a legitimate website to a completely different internet address. Pharming can be conducted by changing the hosts file on a victim's computer or by exploiting a vulnerability on the DNS server.\nBULLET::::- Social engineering where people are manipulated or tricked into performing actions or divulging confidential information.\nBULLET::::- Malicious proxy server (or other \"anonymity\" services).\nBULLET::::- Use of weak passwords that are short, consist of all numbers, all lowercase or all uppercase letters, or that can be easily guessed such as single words, common phrases, a person's name, a pet's name, the name of a place, an address, a phone number, a social security number, or a birth date.\nBULLET::::- Use of recycled passwords or the same password across multiple platforms which have become exposed from a data breach.\nBULLET::::- Using the same login name and/or password for multiple accounts where one compromised account leads to other accounts being compromised.\nBULLET::::- Allowing unused or little used accounts, where unauthorized use is likely to go unnoticed, to remain active.\nBULLET::::- Using out-of-date software that may contain vulnerabilities that have been fixed in newer more up-to-date versions.\nBULLET::::- WebRTC is a protocol which suffers from a serious security flaw that compromises the privacy of VPN-tunnels, by allowing the true IP address of the user to be read. It is enabled by default in major browsers such as Firefox and Google Chrome.", "One such implication, which is rather commonly viewed as being one of the most daunting fears risks of the Internet, is the potential for identity theft. Although it is a typical belief that larger companies and enterprises are the usual focus of identity thefts, rather than individuals, recent reports seem to show a trend opposing this belief. Specifically, it was found in a 2007 \u201cInternet Security Threat Report\u201d that roughly ninety-three percent of \u201cgateway\u201d attacks were targeted at unprepared home users. The term \u201cgateway\u201d attack was used to refer to attack which aimed not at stealing data immediately, but rather at gaining access for future attacks.\n\nBut how, one might ask, is this still thriving given the increasing emphasis on internet security? The simple, but unfortunate solution, according to Symantec's \u201cInternet Security Threat Report\u201d, is that of the expanding \u201cunderground economy\u201d. With more than fifty percent of the supporting servers located in the United States, this \u201cunderground economy\u201d has become a haven for internet thieves, who use the system in order to sell stolen information. These pieces of information can range from generic things such as a user account or email to something as personal as a bank account number and PIN.\n\nWhile the processes these internet thieves use are abundant and unique, one popular trap unsuspecting people fall into is that of online purchasing. This is not to allude to the idea that every purchase one makes online will leave them susceptible to identity theft, but rather that it increases the chances. In fact, in a 2001 article titled \u201cConsumer Watch\u201d, the popular online site PC World went as far as calling secure e-shopping a myth. Though unlike the \u201cgateway\u201d attacks mentioned above, these incidents of information being stolen through online purchases generally are more prevalent in medium to large sized e-commerce sites, rather than smaller individualized sites. This is assumed to be a result of the larger consumer population and purchases, which allow for more potential leeway with information.\n\nUltimately, however, the potential for a violation of one's privacy is typically out of their hands after purchasing from an online \u201ce-tailer\u201d or store. One of the most common forms in which hackers receive private information from online \u201ce-tailers\u201d actually comes from an attack placed upon the site's servers responsible for maintaining information about previous transactions. For as experts explain, these \u201ce-tailers\u201d are not doing nearly enough to maintain or improve their security measures. Even those sites that clearly present a privacy or security policy can be subject to hackers\u2019 havoc as most policies only rely upon encryption technology which only applies to the actual transfer of a customer's data. However, with this being said, most \u201ce-tailers\u201d have been making improvements, going as far as covering some of the credit card fees if the information's abuse can be traced back to the site's servers."], "wikipedia-59012195": ["Privacy concerns regarding search engines can take many forms, such as search engines logging individual search queries, browsing history, IP addresses, and cookies of users, and conducting user profiling in general. The collection of personally identifiable information of users by search engines is referred to as \"tracking\". \nThis is controversial because search engines often claim to collect a user's data in order to tailor better results to that specific user and provide the user with a better searching experience. However, search engines can also abuse and compromise its users' privacy by selling their data to advertisers for profit. In the absence of regulations, users must decide what is more important to their search engine experience: relevance and speed of results or their privacy, and choose a search engine accordingly.\nThe legal framework for protecting user privacy is not very solid. The most popular search engines collect personal information, but other search engines that are focused on privacy have cropped up recently. There have been several well publicized breaches of search engine user privacy that occurred with companies like AOL and Yahoo. For individuals interested in preserving their privacy, there are options available to them, such as using software like Tor makes the user's location and personal information anonymous or using a privacy focused search engine.\n\nGoogle, founded in 1998, is the most widely used search engine, receiving billions and billions of search queries every month. Google logs all search terms in a database along with the date and time of search, browser and operating system, IP address of user, the Google cookie, and the URL that shows the search engine and search query. The privacy policy of Google states that they pass user data on to various affiliates, subsidiaries, and \"trusted\" business partners. \nYahoo, founded in 1995, also collects user data. It is a well-known fact that users do not read privacy policies, even for services that they use daily, such as Yahoo! Mail and Gmail. This persistent failure of consumers to read these privacy policies can be disadvantageous to them because while they may not pick up on differences in the language of privacy policies, judges in court cases certainly do. This means that search engine and email companies like Google and Yahoo are technically able to keep up the practice of targeting advertisements based on email content since they declare that they do so in their privacy policies. A study was done to see how much consumers cared about privacy policies of Google, specifically Gmail, and their detail, and it determined that users often thought that Google's practices were somewhat intrusive but that users would not often be willing to counteract this by paying a premium for their privacy.\n\nMost search engines can, and do, collect personal information about their users according to their own privacy policies. This user data could be anything from location information to cookies, IP addresses, search query histories, click-through history, and online fingerprints. This data is often stored in large databases, and users may be assigned numbers in an attempt to provide them with anonymity.\nData can be stored for an extended period of time. For example, the data collected by Google on its users is retained for up to 9 months. Some studies state that this number is actually 18 months. This data is used for various reasons such as optimizing and personalizing search results for users, targeting advertising, and trying to protect users from scams and phishing attacks. Such data can be collected even when a user is not logged in to their account or when using a different IP address by using cookies.\n\nWhat search engines often do once they have collected information about a user's habits is create a profile of them, which helps the search engine decide which links to show for different search queries submitted by that user or which ads to target them with. An interesting development in this field is the invention of automated learning, also known as machine learning. Using this, search engines can refine their profiling models to more accurately predict what any given user may want to click on by doing A/B testing of results offered to users and measuring the reactions of users.\n\nThe internet advertising company DoubleClick, which helps advertisers target users for specific ads, was bought by Google in 2008 and was a subsidiary until June 2018, when Google rebranded and merged DoubleClick into its Google Marketing Platform. DoubleClick worked by depositing cookies on user's computers that would track sites they visited with DoubleClick ads on them. There was a privacy concern when Google was in the process of acquiring DoubleClick that the acquisition would let Google create even more comprehensive profiles of its users since they would be collecting data about search queries and additionally tracking websites visited. This could lead to users being shown ads that are increasingly effective with the use of behavioral targeting. With more effective ads comes the possibility of more purchases from consumers that they may not have made otherwise.", "This collection of user data can also be seen as an overreach by private companies for their own financial gain or as an intrusive surveillance tactic. Search engines can make money using targeted advertising because advertisers are willing to pay a premium to present their ads to the most receptive consumers. Also, when a search engine collects and catalogs large amounts of data about its users, there is the potential for it to be leaked accidentally or breached. The government can also subpoena user data from search engines when they have databases of it. Search query database information may also be subpoenaed by private litigants for use in civil cases, such as divorces or employment disputes.\nSection::::Data and privacy breaches.:AOL search data leak.\nOne major controversy regarding search engine privacy was the AOL search data leak of 2006. For academic and research purposes, AOL made public a list of about 20 million search queries made by about 650,000 unique users. Although they assigned unique identification numbers to the users instead of attaching names to each query, it was still possible to ascertain the true identities of many users simply by analyzing what they had searched, including locations near them and names of friends and family members. A notable example of this was how the New York Times identified Thelma Arnold through \"reverse searching\". Users also sometimes do \"ego searches\" where they search themselves to see what information about them is on the internet, making it even easier to identify supposedly anonymous users. Many of the search queries released by AOL were incriminating or seemingly extremely private, such as \"how to kill your wife\" and \"can you adopt after a suicide attempt\". This data has since been used in several experiments that attempt to measure the effectiveness of user privacy solutions.\nSection::::Data and privacy breaches.:Google and Yahoo.\nBoth Google and Yahoo were subjects of a Chinese hack in 2010. While Google responded to the situation seriously by hiring new cybersecurity engineers and investing heavily into securing user data, Yahoo took a much more lax approach. Google started paying hackers to find vulnerabilities in 2010 while it took Yahoo until 2013 to follow suit. Yahoo was also identified in the Snowden data leaks as a common hacking target for spies of various nations, and Yahoo still did not give its newly hired chief information security officer the resources to really effect change within the company. In 2012, Yahoo hired Marissa Mayer, previously a Google employee, to be the new CEO, but she chose not to invest much in the security infrastructure of Yahoo and went as far as to refuse the implementation of a basic and standard security measure to force the reset of all passwords after a breach.\nYahoo is known for being the subject of multiple breaches and hacks that have compromised large amounts of user data. As of late 2016, Yahoo had announced that at least 1.5 billion user accounts had been breached during 2013 and 2014. The breach of 2013 compromised over a billion accounts while the breach of 2014 included about 500 million accounts. The data compromised in the breaches included personally identifiable information such as phone numbers, email addresses, and birth dates as well as information like security questions (used to reset passwords) and encrypted passwords. Yahoo made a statement saying that their breaches were a result of state sponsored actors, and in 2017, two Russian intelligence officers were indicted by the United States Department of Justice as part of a conspiracy to hack Yahoo and steal user data. As of 2016, the Yahoo breaches of 2013 and 2014 were the largest of all time.\nIn October 2018, there was a Google+ data breach that potentially affected about 500,000 accounts which led to the shutdown of the Google+ platform.\nSection::::Data and privacy breaches.:Government subpoenas of data.\nThe government may want to subpoena user data from search engines for any number of reasons, which is why it a big threat to user privacy. In 2006, they wanted it as part of their defense of COPA, and only Google refused to comply. While protecting the online privacy of children may be an honorable goal, there are concerns about whether the government should have access to such personal data to achieve it. At other times, they may want it for national security purposes; access to big databases of search queries in order to prevent terrorist attacks is a common example of this. \nWhatever the reason, it is clear that the fact that search engines do create and maintain these databases of user data is what makes it possible for the government to access it. Another concern regarding government access to search engine user data is \"function creep,\" a term that here refers to how data originally collected by the government for national security purposes may eventually be used for other purposes, such as debt collection. This would indicate to many a government overreach. While protections for search engine user privacy have started developing recently, the government has increasingly been on the side that wants to ensure search engines retain data, making users less protected and their data more available for anyone to subpoena."], "wikipedia-48736239": ["Privacy International has raised concerns regarding the dangers and privacy implications of having a centrally located, widely popular data warehouse of millions of Internet users' searches, and how under controversial existing U.S. law, Google can be forced to hand over all such information to the U.S. government. In its 2007 Consultation Report, Privacy International ranked Google as \"Hostile to Privacy\", its lowest rating on their report, making Google the only company in the list to receive that ranking.\n\nHe also said that, \"If I look at enough of your messaging and your location, and use artificial intelligence, we can predict where you are going to go. Show us 14 photos of yourself and we can identify who you are. You think you don't have 14 photos of yourself on the internet? You've got Facebook photos!\"\n\nIn the summer of 2016, Google quietly dropped its ban on personally-identifiable info in its DoubleClick ad service. Google's privacy policy was changed to state it \"may\" combine web-browsing records obtained through DoubleClick with what the company learns from the use of other Google services. While new users were automatically opted-in, existing users were asked if they wanted to opt-in, and it remains possible to opt-out by going to the \"Activity controls\" in the \"My Account\" page of a Google account. \"ProPublica\" states that \"The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct.\"\n\nGoogle is suspected of collecting and aggregating data about Internet users through the various tools it provides to developers, such as Google Analytics, Google Play Services, reCAPTCHA, Google Fonts, and Google APIs. This could enable Google to determine a user's route through the Internet by tracking the IP address being used through successive sites (cross-domain web tracking). Linked to other information made available through Google APIs, which are widely used, Google might be able to provide a quite complete web user profile linked to an IP address or user. This kind of data is invaluable for marketing agencies, and for Google itself to increase the efficiency of its own marketing and advertising activities.\n\nReCAPTCHA uses the google.com domain instead of one specific to ReCAPTCHA. This allows Google to receive any cookies that they have already set for you, effectively bypassing restrictions on setting third party cookies and allowing traffic correlation with all of Google\u2019s other services, which most users use. ReCAPTCHA collects enough information that it could reliably de-anonymize many users that simply wish to prove that they are Not A Robot.\n\nIn 2004, thirty-one privacy and civil liberties organizations wrote a letter calling upon Google to suspend its Gmail service until the privacy issues were adequately addressed. The letter also called upon Google to clarify its written information policies regarding data retention and data sharing among its business units. The organizations voiced their concerns about Google's plan to scan the text of all incoming messages for the purposes of ad placement, noting that the scanning of confidential email for inserting third party ad content violates the implicit trust of an email service provider.\n\nIn 2013, Microsoft launched an advertising campaign to attack Google for scanning email messages, arguing that most consumers are not aware that Google monitors their personal messages to deliver targeted ads. Microsoft claims that its email service Outlook does not scan the contents of messages and a Microsoft spokesperson called the issue of privacy \"Google's kryptonite.\" Other concerns include the unlimited period for data retention that Google's policies allow, and the potential for unintended secondary uses of the information Gmail collects and stores.", "In February 2010, Google was reported to be working on an agreement with the National Security Agency (NSA) to investigate recent attacks against its network. And, while the deal did not give NSA access to Google's data on users' searches or e-mail communications and accounts and Google was not sharing proprietary data with the agency, privacy and civil rights advocates were concerned.\n\nIn October 2004, Google acquired Keyhole, a 3D mapping company. In February 2004, before its acquisition by Google, Keyhole received an investment from In-Q-Tel, the CIA's investment arm. And in July 2010 it was reported that the investment arms of both the CIA (In-Q-Tel) and Google (Google Ventures) were investing in Recorded Future, a company specializing in predictive analytics\u2014monitoring the web in real time and using that information to predict the future. And, while private corporations have been using similar systems since the 1990s, the involvement of Google and the CIA with their large data stores raised privacy concerns.\n\nLeaked NSA documents obtained by \"The Guardian\" and \"The Washington Post\" in June 2013 included Google on the list of companies that cooperate with the NSA's PRISM surveillance program, which authorizes the government to secretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Following the leak, government officials acknowledged the existence of the program. According to the leaked documents, the NSA has direct access to servers of those companies, and the amount of data collected through the program had been growing fast in years prior to the leak. Google has denied the existence of any \"government backdoor\".\n\nIn 2008, Consumer Watchdog produced a video showing how Google Chrome records what a user types into the web address field and sends that information to Google servers to populate search suggestions. The video includes discussion regarding the potential privacy implications of this feature.\n\nGoogle Chrome includes a private browsing feature called \"incognito browsing mode\" that prevents the browser from permanently storing any browsing or download history information or cookies. Using incognito mode prevents tracking by the browser. However, the individual websites visited can still track and store information about visits. In particular any searches performed while signed into a Google account will be saved as part of the account's web history. In addition, other programs such as those used to stream media files, which are invoked from within Chrome, may still record history information, even when incognito mode is being used. Furthermore, a limitation of Apple's iOS 7 platform allows some information from incognito browser windows to leak to regular Chrome browser windows. There are concerns that these limitations may have led Chrome users to believe that incognito mode provides more privacy protection than it actually does.\n\nGoogle's online map service, \"Street View\", has been accused of taking pictures and viewing too far into people's private homes and/or too close to people on the street when they do not know they are being photographed.\n\nDuring 2006\u201310, Google Streetview camera cars collected about 600 gigabytes of data from users of unencrypted public and private Wi-Fi networks in more than 30 countries. No disclosures nor privacy policy was given to those affected, nor to the owners of the Wi-Fi stations.\n\nOn February 9, 2010, Google launched Google Buzz, Google's microblogging service. Anyone with a Gmail account was automatically added as a contact to pre-existing Gmail contacts, and had to opt out if they did not wish to participate.\n\nThe launch of Google Buzz as an \"opt-out\" social network immediately drew criticism for violating user privacy because it automatically allowed Gmail users' contacts to view their other contacts. In 2011, the United States Federal Trade Commission initiated a Commission proceeding against respondent Google, Inc., alleging that certain personal information of Gmail users was shared without consumers' permission through the Google Buzz social network.", "In early 2005, the United States Department of Justice filed a motion in federal court to force Google to comply with a subpoena for \"the text of each search string entered onto Google's search engine over a two-month period (absent any information identifying the person who entered such query).\" Google fought the subpoena, due to concerns about users' privacy. In March 2006, the court ruled partially in Google's favor, recognizing the privacy implications of turning over search terms and refusing to grant access.\nIn April 2008, a Pittsburgh couple, Aaron and Christine Boring, sued Google for \"invasion of privacy\". They claimed that Street View made a photo of their home available online, and it diminished the value of their house, which was purchased for its privacy. They lost their case in a Pennsylvania court. \"While it is easy to imagine that many whose property appears on Google's virtual maps resent the privacy implications, it is hard to believe that any other than the most exquisitely sensitive would suffer shame or humiliation,\" Judge Hay ruled; the Boring family was paid one dollar by Google for the incident.\nIn May 2010, a U.S. District Court in Portland, Oregon ordered Google to hand over two copies of wireless data that the company's Street View program collected as it photographed neighborhoods.\nIn 2012 and 2013, Google reached two settlements over tracking consumers online without their knowledge after bypassing privacy settings in Apple\u2019s Safari browser. The first was settlement in August 2012 for $22.5 million with the Federal Trade Commission\u2014the largest civil penalty the F.T.C. has ever obtained for a violation of a Commission order. The second was a November 2013 settlement for $17 million with 37 states and the District of Columbia. In addition to the fines, Google agreed to avoid using software that overrides a browser's cookie-blocking settings, to avoid omitting or misrepresenting information to consumers about how they use Google products or control the ads they see, to maintain for five years a web page explaining what cookies are and how to control them, and to ensure that the cookies tied to Safari browsers expire. In both settlements Google denied any wrongdoing, but said it discontinued circumventing the settings early in 2012, after the practice was publicly reported, and stopped tracking Safari users and showing them personalized ads.\nIn the summer of 2016, Google quietly dropped its ban on personally-identifiable info in its DoubleClick ad service. Google's privacy policy was changed to state it \"may\" combine web-browsing records obtained through DoubleClick with what the company learns from the use of other Google services. While new users were automatically opted-in, existing users were asked if they wanted to opt-in, and it remains possible to opt-out by going to the Activity controls in the My Account page of a Google account. \"ProPublica\" states that \"The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct.\" Google contacted \"ProPublica\" to correct the fact that it doesn't \"currently\" use Gmail keywords to target web ads."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This technology has been used successfully to inform usability tests, predict user engagement and intent, detect searcher frustration, and infer user attention to parts of a web page, among other tasks. Unfortunately, because mouse cursor tracking can be performed unobtrusively and at scale, it has opened the door to a brand new wave of massive tracking campaigns and companies that hide behind laudable objectives, such as providing fine-grained, in-page analytics (e.g., hovered and clicked items, scroll reach, speed of browsing) to the website owners.

These cookies are not made by the website itself, but by web banner advertising companies. These third-party cookies are so dangerous because they take the same information that regular cookies do, such as browsing habits and frequently visited websites, but then they give out this information to other companies.\n\nCookies are seen so negatively because they are not understood and go unnoticed while someone is simply surfing the Internet. The idea that every move one makes while on the Internet is being watched, would frighten most users.\n\nThe process of \"profiling\" (also known as \"tracking\") assembles and analyzes several events, each attributable to a single originating entity, in order to gain information (especially patterns of activity) relating to the originating entity. Some organizations engage in the profiling of people's web browsing, collecting the URLs of sites visited. The resulting profiles can potentially link with information that personally identifies the individual who did the browsing.\n\nProfiling becomes a more contentious privacy issue when data-matching associates the profile of an individual with personally-identifiable information of the individual.\n\nGovernments and organizations may set up honeypot websites \u2013 featuring controversial topics \u2013 with the purpose of attracting and tracking unwary people.

Evercookie accomplishes this by storing the cookie data in several types of storage mechanisms that are available on the local browser. It has the ability to store cookies in over ten types of storage mechanisms so that once they are on one's computer they will never be gone. Additionally, if evercookie has found the user has removed any of the types of cookies in question, it recreates them using each mechanism available. Evercookies are one type of zombie cookie.\n\nThere is controversy over where the line should be drawn on the use of this technology. Cookies store unique identifiers on a person's computer that are used to predict what one wants. Many advertisement companies want to use this technology to track what their customers are looking at online. This type of method is known as online behavioral advertising where advertisers are keeping track of the consumer's website visits to personalize and target advertisements. Evercookies enable advertisers to continue to track a customer regardless of if one deletes their cookies or not.\n\nDevice fingerprinting is a fairly new technology that is useful in fraud prevention and safeguarding any information from one's computer. Device fingerprinting uses data from the device and browser sessions to determine the risk of conducting business with the person using the device. This technology allows companies to better assess the risks when business is conducted through sites that include, e-commerce sites, social networking and online dating sites and banks and other financial institutions.\n\nIt is difficult to surf the web without being tracked by device fingerprinting today. However, for people who do not want device fingerprinting, there are ways to attempt to block fingerprinting.

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University combined image scanning, cloud computing and public profiles from social network sites to identify individuals in the offline world. Data captured even included a user's social security number. Experts have warned of the privacy risks faced by the increased merging of our online and offline identities. The researchers have also developed an 'augmented reality' mobile app that can display personal data over a person's image captured on a smartphone screen. Since these technologies are widely available, our future identities may become exposed to anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. Researchers believe this could force us to reconsider our future attitudes to privacy.", "Which information an ISP collects, what it does with that information, and whether it informs its consumers, pose significant privacy issues. Beyond the usage of collected information typical of third parties, ISPs sometimes state that they will make their information available to government authorities upon request. In the US and other countries, such a request does not necessarily require a warrant.\nHTML5 expands the number of methods given to a website to store information locally on a client as well as the amount of data that can be stored. As such, privacy risks are increased. For instance, merely erasing cookies may not be enough to remove potential tracking methods since data could be mirrored in web storage, another means of keeping information in a user's web browser. There are so many sources of data storage that it is challenging for web browsers to present sensible privacy settings. As the power of web standards increases, so do potential misuses.\nHTML5 also expands access to user media, potentially granting access to a computer's microphone or webcam, a capability previously only possible through the use of plug-ins like Flash. It is also possible to find a user's geographical location using the geolocation API. With this expanded access comes increased potential for abuse as well as more vectors for attackers.

A recent paper from the Rand Corporation claims \"privacy is not the opposite of sharing \u2013 rather, it is control over sharing.\" Internet privacy concerns arise from our surrender of personal information to engage in a variety of acts, from transactions to commenting in online forums.

Data can be collected from multiple devices used by a single user and correlated to form a more accurate picture of the person being tracked. Moreover, malicious actors may use variants of the technology to deanonymize anonymity network users.\nUltrasonic tracking technologies can pose massive threats to users\u2019 privacy. There are four primary privacy concerns associated with this new form of tracking:\nBULLET::::- The first is \"media tracking\": audio from the user\u2019s television may be detected by the microphone in the user\u2019s mobile device, allowing malicious actors to gain access to what the user is watching\u2013\u2013particularly if it is salacious. Advertisers can similarly gain insight into what a user typically watches. In both scenarios, a user\u2019s real-world behavior is linked to their online identity and used for tracking.\nBULLET::::- Another form of tracking permitted by ultrasonic tracking is \"cross-device tracking\", which enables a user\u2019s profile to be connected across multiple devices based on proximity. This form of tracking, in linking different devices, can help advertisers show more targeted ads or open individuals to attacks by malicious actors.\nBULLET::::- \"Location tracking\" is yet another privacy concern. Indeed, ultrasonic signals can convey location information via a location identifier, often placed in stores or businesses.\nBULLET::::- Lastly, this new ultrasonic tracking poses a threat to users of Bitcoin and Tor because it \"deanonymizes\" users\u2019 information, since ultrasonic signals associate the user\u2019s mobile phone with the Bitcoin or Tor account.", "This form of capitalism seeks to commodify private human experience to create behavioral futures markets, in which behavior is predicted and behavioral data is harvested from the user. Zuboff suggests that this new era of surveillance capitalism eclipses Bentham's panopticon, becoming far more encroaching and invasive as, unlike a prison, there is no escape, and the thoughts, feelings, and actions of users are immediately extracted to be commodified and resold. Thus, since cross-device tracking seeks to create a profile of a user across multiple devices, big tech companies, such as Google, could use this behavioral data to make predictions about the user\u2019s future behavior without the user\u2019s awareness.\n\nIndeed, the usage of free online services, such as public Wi-Fi, often comes at the unknown cost to the user of being tracked and profiled by the company providing the service.

The FTC has also cracked down on companies like Compete, a browser toolbar, because it decrypted users\u2019 personal information on the internet, putting users at risk. Lastly, in cases during which deception is used to engage in surveillance, the FTC has investigated private investigators, who surveil individuals on another person\u2019s behalf. In addition, audio beacon technology, used by an application called Silverpush, could violate the FTC\u2019s policies because users were not made aware as to when the ultrasonic signals were being recorded. Virtual reality can become a privacy issue because it attempts to immerse users into the virtual environment by recording a user's every sensation. Customers are also being denied a voice in contracts, since only corporations set the rules by which individuals\u2019 private information is mined and extracted. Ethically, Zuboff points to the extraction, commodification, and analysis of private human experiences as well as increased surveillance\u2013\u2013which is sometimes hidden\u2013\u2013in everyday life as violating users' rights to privacy. The usage of surreptitious methods, in which the user is unaware of the extent to which he or she is being tracked, brings tracking mechanisms\u2013\u2013such as cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons\u2013\u2013into the ethical realm as well since users are not being informed of this tracking perhaps as often as they should."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This technology has been used successfully to inform usability tests, predict user engagement and intent, detect searcher frustration, and infer user attention to parts of a web page, among other tasks. Unfortunately, because mouse cursor tracking can be performed unobtrusively and at scale, it has opened the door to a brand new wave of massive tracking campaigns and companies that hide behind laudable objectives, such as providing fine-grained, in-page analytics (e.g., hovered and clicked items, scroll reach, speed of browsing) to the website owners.

However, the cookie-based approach remains to this day the dominant one, since it is fully supported by all web browsers. With a cookie identifying the user's browser, a third party domain can track the user activity across websites using redirection techniques or providing a free service that makes cross-domain tracking possible, such as the Facebook `Like' button or social media sharing plugins for WordPress. Then, by analyzing the content of the browsed websites, the tracking domain can effortlessly -- and at an unprecedented scale -- derive users' intentions and interests, alongside with other sensitive profiling information~\\cite{Iordanou2019WhosTS, Ren_2016}. There is a plethora of work that capitalize on user profiling based on how we browse. For example, our browsing history is used to detect targeted ads~\\cite{Carrascosa_2015, MyAdChoices_Jagdish16} or even identify which attribute or user action triggered a specific ad~\\cite{xray, Wills_2012}. Olejnik et al.~\\cite{Olejnik12} noticed that, with just 4 visited websites, it is possible to uniquely identify users in 97\\% of cases. At the same time, Web users are concerned about third-party tracking~\\cite{McDonald10}, especially about location access and inferring demographics~\\cite{Wills10}. Researchers have found that people are likely to take actions to protect their privacy~\\cite{Malandrino13}, including the payment of a premium fee if needed~\\cite{Tsai11}. And while some websites and tracking companies inform users about their data practices through privacy policies and sometimes provide opt-outs~\\cite{Schaub16}, these measures are insufficient. Today, advancements in web advertising provide new opportunities to trackers and advertisers to extend their visibility. Online ads are rendered dynamically during the load time of the browsed website, most of the time as a result of additional (tracking) JavaScript code that is injected on the fly~\\cite{Iordanou_2018}. This opens the door to more sophisticated tracking techniques, among which we find mouse cursor tracking to be an underestimated one. In the following section, we highlight how this technology has been used in various scenarios and how pervasive it has become. In fact, today most websites include analytics scripts, and a large number of them contains some mouse tracking script~\\cite{Englehardt17}. Users consider ad targeting useful because it highlights relevant information, but at the same time they find the underlying data collection alarming~\\cite{Ur12} and invasive~\\cite{McDonald10_attitudes}. Plane et al.~\\cite{Plane17} found that users were more concerned if an ad was targeted based on demographics, such as age, gender, or race, than based on interests. Overall, users do not want targeted advertising when they are made aware of the data collection methods employed by the advertisers~\\cite{Turow09}, and consider targeting based on demographics to be discriminatory~\\cite{Sweeney13}.

This dystopian reality evokes a disconcerting dichotomy between, on the one hand, having to accept a digital life with no privacy and, on the other hand, retaining our privacy by being off the digital life. Privacy is essential for the citizens of both the physical and the digital world. But also privacy is constantly being juxtaposed with competing goods and interests, balanced against disparate needs and demands~\\cite{Pozen16}. More importantly, the loss of privacy translates into a loss of freedom. In other words, freedom of expression is threatened by the surveillance of our digital traces; thought patterns and intentions can be extrapolated from website visits (rightly or wrongly), and the knowledge that we are being surveyed can make one less likely to research a particular topic. And even efforts to regulate the web tracking landscape, such as the DNT Header, require good faith cooperation from the parties at the other end of the web connection, which is not always guaranteed. In fact, most tracking domains and ad platforms are unlikely to ignore user tracking, because they make their business out of these data.

Because the data had been predicted, rather than directly observed or reported, the company had no legal obligation to protect the privacy of those customers.\nWeb search algorithms have also been accused of bias. Google's results may prioritize pornographic content in search terms related to sexuality, for example, \"lesbian\". This bias extends to the search engine showing popular but sexualized content in neutral searches. For example, \"Top 25 Sexiest Women Athletes\" articles displayed as first-page results in searches for \"women athletes\". In 2017, Google adjusted these results along with others that surfaced hate groups, racist views, child abuse and pornography, and other upsetting and offensive content. Other examples include the display of higher-paying jobs to male applicants on job search websites.\nIn 2018, Amazon.com turned off a system it developed to screen job applications when they realized it was biased against women.\nSection::::Impact.:Racial and ethnic discrimination.\nAlgorithms have been criticized as a method for obscuring racial prejudices in decision-making. Because of how certain races and ethnic groups were treated in the past, data can often contain hidden biases. For example, black people are likely to receive longer sentences than white people who committed the same crime. This could potentially mean that a system amplifies the original biases in the data.\nOne example is the use of risk assessments in criminal sentencing in the United States and parole hearings, judges were presented with an algorithmically generated score intended to reflect the risk that a prisoner will repeat a crime. For the time period starting in 1920 and ending in 1970, the nationality of a criminals's father was a consideration in those risk assessment scores. Today, these scores are shared with judges in Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. An independent investigation by ProPublica found that the scores were inaccurate 80% of the time, and disproportionately skewed to suggest blacks to be at risk of relapse, 77% more often than whites.\nIn 2015, Google apologized when black users complained that an image-identification algorithm in its Photos application identified them as gorillas. In 2010, Nikon cameras were criticized when image-recognition algorithms consistently asked Asian users if they were blinking. Such examples are the product of bias in biometric data sets. Biometric data is drawn from aspects of the body, including racial features either observed or inferred, which can then be transferred into data points. Speech recognition technology can have different accuracies depending on the user's accent. This may be caused by the a lack of training data for speakers of that accent.\nBiometric data about race may also be inferred, rather than observed. For example, a 2012 study showed that names commonly associated with blacks were more likely to yield search results implying arrest records, regardless of whether there is any police record of that individual's name.\nOne study that set out to examine \u201cRisk, Race, & Recidivism: Predictive Bias and Disparate Impact\u201d alleges a two-fold (45 percent vs. 23 percent) adverse likelihood for black vs. Caucasian defendants to be misclassified as imposing a higher risk despite having objectively remained without any documented recidivism over a two-year period of observation. .\nSection::::Impact.:Racial and ethnic discrimination.:Online hate speech.\nIn 2017 a Facebook algorithm designed to remove online hate speech was found to advantage white men over black children when assessing objectionable content, according to internal Facebook documents. The algorithm, which is a combination of computer programs and human content reviewers, was created to protect broad categories rather than specific subsets of categories. For example, posts denouncing \"Muslims\" would be blocked, while posts denouncing \"Radical Muslims\" would be allowed. An unanticipated outcome of the algorithm is to allow hate speech against black children, because they denounce the \"children\" subset of blacks, rather than \"all blacks,\" whereas \"all white men\" would trigger a block, because whites and males are not considered subsets. Facebook was also found to allow ad purchasers to target \"Jew haters\" as a category of users, which the company said was an inadvertent outcome of algorithms used in assessing and categorizing data. The company's design also allowed ad buyers to block African-Americans from seeing housing ads.\nSection::::Impact.:Racial and ethnic discrimination.:Surveillance.\nSurveillance camera software may be considered inherently political because it requires algorithms to distinguish normal from abnormal behaviors, and to determine who belongs in certain locations at certain times. The ability of such algorithms to recognize faces across a racial spectrum has been shown to be limited by the racial diversity of images in its training database; if the majority of photos belong to one race or gender, the software is better at recognizing other members of that race or gender. A 2002 analysis of software used to identify individuals in CCTV images found several examples of bias when run against criminal databases. The software was assessed as identifying men more frequently than women, older people more frequently than the young, and identified Asians, African-Americans and other races more often than whites. Additional studies of facial recognition software have found the opposite to be true when trained on non-criminal databases, with the software being the least accurate in identifying darker-skinned females.\nSection::::Impact.:Sexual discrimination.\nIn 2011, users of the gay hookup application Grindr reported that the Android store's recommendation algorithm was linking Grindr to applications designed to find sex offenders, which critics said inaccurately related homosexuality with pedophilia. Writer Mike Ananny criticized this association in \"The Atlantic\", arguing that such associations further stigmatized gay men. In 2009, online retailer Amazon de-listed 57,000 books after an algorithmic change expanded its \"adult content\" blacklist to include any book addressing sexuality or gay themes, such as the critically acclaimed novel \"Brokeback Mountain\".\nIn 2019, it was found that on Facebook, searches for \"photos of my female friends\" yielded suggestions such as \"in bikinis\" or \"at the beach\".

The people depicted in these photos might not want to have them appear on the Internet. Police arrest photos, considered public record in many jurisdictions, are often posted on the internet by numerous online mug shot publishing sites.\nSome organizations attempt to respond to this privacy-related concern. For example, the 2005 Wikimania conference required that photographers have the prior permission of the people in their pictures, albeit this made it impossible for photographers to practice candid photography and doing the same in a public place would violate the photographers' free speech rights. Some people wore a \"no photos\" tag to indicate they would prefer not to have their photo taken .\nThe \"Harvard Law Review\" published a short piece called \"In The Face of Danger: Facial Recognition and Privacy Law\", much of it explaining how \"privacy law, in its current form, is of no help to those unwillingly tagged.\" Any individual can be unwillingly tagged in a photo and displayed in a manner that might violate them personally in some way, and by the time Facebook gets to taking down the photo, many people will have already had the chance to view, share, or distribute it. Furthermore, traditional tort law does not protect people who are captured by a photograph in public because this is not counted as an invasion of privacy. The extensive Facebook privacy policy covers these concerns and much more. For example, the policy states that they reserve the right to disclose member information or share photos with companies, lawyers, courts, government entities, etc. if they feel it absolutely necessary. The policy also informs users that profile pictures are mainly to help friends connect to each other. However, these, as well as other pictures, can allow other people to invade a person's privacy by finding out information that can be used to track and locate a certain individual. In an article featured in ABC News, it was stated that two teams of scientists found out that Hollywood stars could be giving up information about their private whereabouts very easily through pictures uploaded to the Internet. Moreover, it was found that pictures taken by some phones and tablets including iPhones automatically attach the latitude and longitude of the picture taken through metadata unless this function is manually disabled.\nFace recognition technology can be used to gain access to a person's private data, according to a new study. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University combined image scanning, cloud computing and public profiles from social network sites to identify individuals in the offline world. Data captured even included a user's social security number. Experts have warned of the privacy risks faced by the increased merging of our online and offline identities. The researchers have also developed an 'augmented reality' mobile app that can display personal data over a person's image captured on a smartphone screen. Since these technologies are widely available, our future identities may become exposed to anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. Researchers believe this could force us to reconsider our future attitudes to privacy.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Photographs on the Internet.:Google Street View.\nGoogle Street View, released in the U.S. in 2007, is currently the subject of an ongoing debate about possible infringement on individual privacy. In an article entitled \u201cPrivacy, Reconsidered: New Representations, Data Practices, and the Geoweb\u201d, Sarah Elwood and Agnieszka Leszczynski (2011) argue that Google Street View \u201cfacilitate[s] identification and disclosure with more immediacy and less abstraction.\u201d The medium through which Street View disseminates information, the photograph, is very immediate in the sense that it can potentially provide direct information and evidence about a person's whereabouts, activities, and private property. Moreover, the technology's disclosure of information about a person is less abstract in the sense that, if photographed, a person is represented on Street View in a virtual replication of his or her own real-life appearance. In other words, the technology removes abstractions of a person's appearance or that of his or her personal belongings \u2013 there is an immediate disclosure of the person and object, as they visually exist in real life. Although Street View began to blur license plates and people's faces in 2008, the technology is faulty and does not entirely ensure against accidental disclosure of identity and private property. Elwood and Leszczynski note that \u201cmany of the concerns leveled at Street View stem from situations where its photograph-like images were treated as definitive evidence of an individual\u2019s involvement in particular activities.\u201d In one instance, Ruedi Noser, a Swiss politician, barely avoided public scandal when he was photographed in 2009 on Google Street View walking with a woman who was not his wife \u2013 the woman was actually his secretary. Similar situations occur when Street View provides high-resolution photographs \u2013 and photographs hypothetically offer compelling objective evidence. But as the case of the Swiss politician illustrates, even supposedly compelling photographic evidence is sometimes subject to gross misinterpretation. This example further suggests that Google Street View may provide opportunities for privacy infringement and harassment through public dissemination of the photographs. Google Street View does, however, blur or remove photographs of individuals and private property from image frames if the individuals request further blurring and/or removal of the images. This request can be submitted, for review, through the \u201creport a problem\u201d button that is located on the bottom left-hand side of every image window on Google Street View, however, Google has made attempts to report a problem difficult by disabling the \"Why are you reporting the street view\" icon.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Search engines.\nSearch engines have the ability to track a user's searches. Personal information can be revealed through searches by the user's computer, account, or IP address being linked to the search terms used. Search engines have claimed a necessity to retain such information in order to provide better services, protect against security pressure, and protect against fraud.\nA search engine takes all of its users and assigns each one a specific ID number. Those in control of the database often keep records of where on the Internet each member has traveled to. AOL's system is one example. AOL has a database 21 million members deep, each with their own specific ID number. The way that AOLSearch is set up, however, allows for AOL to keep records of all the websites visited by any given member. Even though the true identity of the user isn't known, a full profile of a member can be made just by using the information stored by AOLSearch. By keeping records of what people query through AOLSearch, the company is able to learn a great deal about them without knowing their names.\nSearch engines also are able to retain user information, such as location and time spent using the search engine, for up to ninety days. Most search engine operators use the data to get a sense of which needs must be met in certain areas of their field. People working in the legal field are also allowed to use information collected from these search engine websites. The Google search engine is given as an example of a search engine that retains the information entered for a period of three-fourths of a year before it becomes obsolete for public usage. Yahoo! follows in the footsteps of Google in the sense that it also deletes user information after a period of ninety days. Other search engines such as Ask! search engine has promoted a tool of \"AskEraser\" which essentially takes away personal information when requested.\nSome changes made to Internet search engines included that of Google's search engine. Beginning in 2009, Google began to run a new system where the Google search became personalized. The item that is searched and the results that are shown remembers previous information that pertains to the individual. Google search engine not only seeks what is searched, but also strives to allow the user to feel like the search engine recognizes their interests. This is achieved by using online advertising. A system that Google uses to filter advertisements and search results that might interest the user is by having a ranking system that tests relevancy that include observation of the behavior users exude while searching on Google. Another function of search engines is the predictability of location. Search engines are able to predict where one's location is currently by locating IP Addresses and geographical locations.\nGoogle had publicly stated on January 24, 2012, that its privacy policy will once again be altered. This new policy will change the following for its users: (1) the privacy policy will become shorter and easier", "Users and public officials have raised many concerns regarding Google's new privacy policy. The main concern/issue involves the sharing of data from multiple sources. Because this policy gathers all information and data searched from multiple engines when logged into Google, and uses it to help assist users, privacy becomes an important element. Public officials and Google account users are worried about online safety because of all this information being gathered from multiple sources.\n\nSome users do not like the overlapping privacy policy, wishing to keep the service of Google separate. The update to Google's privacy policy has alarmed both public and private sectors. The European Union has asked Google to delay the onset of the new privacy policy in order to ensure that it does not violate E.U. law. This move is in accordance with objections to decreasing online privacy raised in other foreign nations where surveillance is more heavily scrutinized. Canada and Germany have both held investigations into the legality of both Facebook, against respective privacy acts, in 2010. The new privacy policy only heightens unresolved concerns regarding user privacy.\n\nAn additional feature of concern to the new Google privacy policy is the nature of the policy. One must accept all features or delete existing Google accounts. The update will affect the Google+ social network, therefore making Google+\u2019s settings uncustomizable, unlike other customizable social networking sites. Customizing the privacy settings of a social network is a key tactic that many feel is necessary for social networking sites. This update in the system has some Google+ users wary of continuing service. Additionally, some fear the sharing of data amongst Google services could lead to revelations of identities. Many using pseudonyms are concerned about this possibility, and defend the role of pseudonyms in literature and history.", "Section::::Risks to Internet privacy.:HTML5.\nHTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language specification. HTML defines how user agents, such as web browsers, are to present websites based upon their underlying code. This new web standard changes the way that users are affected by the internet and their privacy on the internet. HTML5 expands the number of methods given to a website to store information locally on a client as well as the amount of data that can be stored. As such, privacy risks are increased. For instance, merely erasing cookies may not be enough to remove potential tracking methods since data could be mirrored in web storage, another means of keeping information in a user's web browser. There are so many sources of data storage that it is challenging for web browsers to present sensible privacy settings. As the power of web standards increases, so do potential misuses.\nHTML5 also expands access to user media, potentially granting access to a computer's microphone or webcam, a capability previously only possible through the use of plug-ins like Flash. It is also possible to find a user's geographical location using the geolocation API. With this expanded access comes increased potential for abuse as well as more vectors for attackers. If a malicious site was able to gain access to a user's media, it could potentially use recordings to uncover sensitive information thought to be unexposed. However, the World Wide Web Consortium, responsible for many web standards, feels that the increased capabilities of the web platform outweigh potential privacy concerns. They state that by documenting new capabilities in an open standardization process, rather than through closed source plug-ins made by companies, it is easier to spot flaws in specifications and cultivate expert advice.\nBesides elevating privacy concerns, HTML5 also adds a few tools to enhance user privacy. A mechanism is defined whereby user agents can share blacklists of domains that should not be allowed to access web storage. Content Security Policy is a proposed standard whereby sites may assign privileges to different domains, enforcing harsh limitations on JavaScript use to mitigate cross-site scripting attacks. HTML5 also adds HTML templating and a standard HTML parser which replaces the various parsers of web browser vendors. These new features formalize previously inconsistent implementations, reducing the number of vulnerabilities though not eliminating them entirely.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Big Data.\nBig Data is generally defined as the rapid accumulation and compiling of massive amounts of information that is being exchanged over digital communication systems. The data is large (often exceeding exabytes) and cannot be handled by conventional computer processors, and are instead stored on large server-system databases. This information is assessed by analytic scientists using software programs; which paraphrase this information into multi-layered user trends and demographics. This information is collected from all around the Internet, such as by popular services like Facebook, Google, Apple, Spotify or GPS systems. \nBig Data provides companies with the ability to:\nBULLET::::- Infer detailed psycho-demographic profiles of internet users, even if they were not directly expressed or indicated by users.\nBULLET::::- Inspect product availability and optimize prices for maximum profit while clearing inventory.\nBULLET::::- Swiftly reconfigure risk portfolios in minutes and understand future opportunities to mitigate risk.\nBULLET::::- Mine customer data for insight, and create advertising strategies for customer acquisition and retention.\nBULLET::::- Identify customers who matter the most.\nBULLET::::- Create retail coupons based on a proportional scale to how much the customer has spent, to ensure a higher redemption rate.\nBULLET::::- Send tailored recommendations to mobile devices at just the right time, while customers are in the right location to take advantage of offers.\nBULLET::::- Analyze data from social media to detect new market trends and changes in demand.\nBULLET::::- Use clickstream analysis and data mining to detect fraudulent behavior.\nBULLET::::- Determine root causes of failures, issues and defects by investigating user sessions, network logs and machine sensors.\nSection::::Risks to Internet privacy.:Other potential Internet privacy risks.\nBULLET::::- Malware is a term short for \"malicious software\" and is used to describe software to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network whether that is through the use of a virus, trojan horse, spyware, etc.\nBULLET::::- Spyware is a piece of software that obtains information from a user's computer without that user's consent.\nBULLET::::- A web bug is an object embedded into a web page or email and is usually invisible to the user of the website or reader of the email. It allows checking to see if a person has looked at a particular website or read a specific email message.\nBULLET::::- Phishing is a criminally fraudulent process of trying to obtain sensitive information such as user names, passwords, credit card or bank information. Phishing is an internet crime in which someone masquerades as a trustworthy entity in some form of electronic communication.\nBULLET::::- Pharming is a hacker's attempt to redirect traffic from a legitimate website to a completely different internet address. Pharming can be conducted by changing the hosts file on a victim's computer or by exploiting a vulnerability on the DNS server.\nBULLET::::- Social engineering where people are manipulated or tricked into performing actions or divulging confidential information.\nBULLET::::- Malicious proxy server (or other \"anonymity\" services).\nBULLET::::- Use of weak passwords that are short, consist of all numbers, all lowercase or all uppercase letters, or that can be easily guessed such as single words, common phrases, a person's name, a pet's name, the name of a place, an address, a phone number, a social security number, or a birth date.\nBULLET::::- Use of recycled passwords or the same password across multiple platforms which have become exposed from a data breach.\nBULLET::::- Using the same login name and/or password for multiple accounts where one compromised account leads to other accounts being compromised.\nBULLET::::- Allowing unused or little used accounts, where unauthorized use is likely to go unnoticed, to remain active.\nBULLET::::- Using out-of-date software that may contain vulnerabilities that have been fixed in newer more up-to-date versions.\nBULLET::::- WebRTC is a protocol which suffers from a serious security flaw that compromises the privacy of VPN-tunnels, by allowing the true IP address of the user to be read. It is enabled by default in major browsers such as Firefox and Google Chrome.", "One such implication, which is rather commonly viewed as being one of the most daunting fears risks of the Internet, is the potential for identity theft. Although it is a typical belief that larger companies and enterprises are the usual focus of identity thefts, rather than individuals, recent reports seem to show a trend opposing this belief. Specifically, it was found in a 2007 \u201cInternet Security Threat Report\u201d that roughly ninety-three percent of \u201cgateway\u201d attacks were targeted at unprepared home users. The term \u201cgateway\u201d attack was used to refer to attack which aimed not at stealing data immediately, but rather at gaining access for future attacks.\n\nBut how, one might ask, is this still thriving given the increasing emphasis on internet security? The simple, but unfortunate solution, according to Symantec's \u201cInternet Security Threat Report\u201d, is that of the expanding \u201cunderground economy\u201d. With more than fifty percent of the supporting servers located in the United States, this \u201cunderground economy\u201d has become a haven for internet thieves, who use the system in order to sell stolen information. These pieces of information can range from generic things such as a user account or email to something as personal as a bank account number and PIN.\n\nWhile the processes these internet thieves use are abundant and unique, one popular trap unsuspecting people fall into is that of online purchasing. This is not to allude to the idea that every purchase one makes online will leave them susceptible to identity theft, but rather that it increases the chances. In fact, in a 2001 article titled \u201cConsumer Watch\u201d, the popular online site PC World went as far as calling secure e-shopping a myth. Though unlike the \u201cgateway\u201d attacks mentioned above, these incidents of information being stolen through online purchases generally are more prevalent in medium to large sized e-commerce sites, rather than smaller individualized sites. This is assumed to be a result of the larger consumer population and purchases, which allow for more potential leeway with information.\n\nUltimately, however, the potential for a violation of one's privacy is typically out of their hands after purchasing from an online \u201ce-tailer\u201d or store. One of the most common forms in which hackers receive private information from online \u201ce-tailers\u201d actually comes from an attack placed upon the site's servers responsible for maintaining information about previous transactions. For as experts explain, these \u201ce-tailers\u201d are not doing nearly enough to maintain or improve their security measures. Even those sites that clearly present a privacy or security policy can be subject to hackers\u2019 havoc as most policies only rely upon encryption technology which only applies to the actual transfer of a customer's data. However, with this being said, most \u201ce-tailers\u201d have been making improvements, "], "wikipedia-50018370": ["Ultrasonic tracking technologies can pose massive threats to users\u2019 privacy. There are four primary privacy concerns associated with this new form of tracking:\nBULLET::::- The first is \"media tracking\": audio from the user\u2019s television may be detected by the microphone in the user\u2019s mobile device, allowing malicious actors to gain access to what the user is watching\u2013\u2013particularly if it is salacious. Advertisers can similarly gain insight into what a user typically watches. In both scenarios, a user\u2019s real-world behavior is linked to their online identity and used for tracking.\nBULLET::::- Another form of tracking permitted by ultrasonic tracking is \"cross-device tracking\", which enables a user\u2019s profile to be connected across multiple devices based on proximity. This form of tracking, in linking different devices, can help advertisers show more targeted ads or open individuals to attacks by malicious actors.\nBULLET::::- \"Location tracking\" is yet another privacy concern. Indeed, ultrasonic signals can convey location information via a location identifier, often placed in stores or businesses.\nBULLET::::- Lastly, this new ultrasonic tracking poses a threat to users of Bitcoin and Tor because it \"deanonymizes\" users\u2019 information, since ultrasonic signals associate the user\u2019s mobile phone with the Bitcoin or Tor account.", "Section::::Privacy and surveillance concerns.:Surveillance capitalism.\nThe increased usage of cross-device tracking by advertisers is indicative of the rise of a new era of data extraction and analysis as a form of profit, or surveillance capitalism, a term coined by Shoshana Zuboff. This form of capitalism seeks to commodify private human experience to create behavioral futures markets, in which behavior is predicted and behavioral data is harvested from the user. Zuboff suggests that this new era of surveillance capitalism eclipses Bentham's panopticon, becoming far more encroaching and invasive as, unlike a prison, there is no escape, and the thoughts, feelings, and actions of users are immediately extracted to be commodified and resold. Thus, since cross-device tracking seeks to create a profile of a user across multiple devices, big tech companies, such as Google, could use this behavioral data to make predictions about the user\u2019s future behavior without the user\u2019s awareness.\n\nSection::::Privacy and surveillance concerns.:Cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons.\nAdditionally, privacy concerns surround cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons on websites today. Ultimately, five main concerns surround the usage of cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons, according to a study:\nBULLET::::- Firstly, the authors note that users lack \"anonymity\" online, with cookies utilizing unique identifiers and flash cookies enabling recognition of website visits\nBULLET::::- Another concern the authors note is \"unintended uses of cookies,\" since cookies were initially designed to benefit the user\u2019s experience and engagement online, but have since morphed into a business run by advertisers in which personal data is sold for profit\nBULLET::::- Users are likely unaware of how their personal information is being used, reflecting the \"surreptitious nature of data collection\"\nBULLET::::- Some cookies \"trespass into the web users\u2019 own resources\" and are downloaded to the user\u2019s computer often without the user\u2019s awareness\nBULLET::::- Lastly, the authors note that the \"threat of cookie sharing\" underscores how web users\u2019 personal information can become combined with other data from websites and even a social security number to create a more cohesive picture of the user\n\nSection::::Privacy and surveillance concerns.:Data capitalism.\nOther scholars have defined a similarly extractive and destructive phenomenon called data capitalism. Data capitalism is an economic system enabling the redistribution of power towards those who have access to the information\u2013\u2013namely, big corporations. There are three fundamental theories of how large companies engage users in virtual communities, reflecting the power of data capitalism on users today:\nBULLET::::- The free and open network: in making products free, large companies make their products more accessible to a larger audience from which they can extract valuable data in exchange.\nBULLET::::- The connection between people and machines: data capitalism promotes a connection between people and machines which is derived from the user\u2019s relationship to the technology itself. Increasingly, tracking and surveillance technology is profiling users and learning their preferences, users become more comfortable with their devices and a self-fulfilling prophecy continues.\nBULLET::::- The value placed on data: new information asymmetries are proliferating that exacerbate inequality of information and allow only the most powerful access to most people\u2019s data. Increasingly, a scholar suggests that the lack of transparency over users\u2019 data reflects the tension between privacy and community online.", "In the case of malware, the FTC has placed pressure on companies such as CyberSpy, a self-proclaimed email attachment company that claimed to secretly record users\u2019 key presses. The FTC has also cracked down on companies like Compete, a browser toolbar, because it decrypted users\u2019 personal information on the internet, putting users at risk. Lastly, in cases during which deception is used to engage in surveillance, the FTC has investigated private investigators, who surveil individuals on another person\u2019s behalf. In addition, audio beacon technology, used by an application called Silverpush, could violate the FTC\u2019s policies because users were not made aware as to when the ultrasonic signals were being recorded.\nAnother scholar believes that the convergence between lived experience and online technology is creating a term called Mixed Reality, in which people and things are replaced with virtual experiences. Mixed Reality technologies can pose legal challenges in that laws which govern the online world will also extend to the real world. In addition, data tagging\u2013\u2013often through GPS, location-based services, or even near-field communication (NFC)\u2013\u2013is the new technology at the heart of mixed reality, since people\u2019s data is determined in part by their location. Near-field communication enables devices to transmit data to each other with a certain range. Virtual reality can become a privacy issue because it attempts to immerse users into the virtual environment by recording a user's every sensation. In turn, mixed reality\u2019s amalgamation with daily tasks suggest that it will be implicated in numerous legal issues ranging from copyright law to intellectual property law. Customers are also being denied a voice in contracts, since only corporations set the rules by which individuals\u2019 private information is mined and extracted. The solution to these issues, according to scholars, are opt-in controls to police users\u2019 privacy that enable balance to be restored to the law, particularly as it stands regarding contracts.\nEthically, Zuboff points to the extraction, commodification, and analysis of private human experiences as well as increased surveillance\u2013\u2013which is sometimes hidden\u2013\u2013in everyday life as violating users' rights to privacy. The usage of surreptitious methods, in which the user is unaware of the extent to which he or she is being tracked, brings tracking mechanisms\u2013\u2013such as cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons\u2013\u2013into the ethical realm as well since users are not being informed of this tracking perhaps as often as they should."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This technology has been used successfully to inform usability tests, predict user engagement and intent, detect searcher frustration, and infer user attention to parts of a web page, among other tasks. Unfortunately, because mouse cursor tracking can be performed unobtrusively and at scale, it has opened the door to a brand new wave of massive tracking campaigns and companies that hide behind laudable objectives, such as providing fine-grained, in-page analytics (e.g., hovered and clicked items, scroll reach, speed of browsing) to the website owners.

Then, by analyzing the content of the browsed websites, the tracking domain can effortlessly -- and at an unprecedented scale -- derive users' intentions and interests, alongside with other sensitive profiling information. There is a plethora of work that capitalize on user profiling based on how we browse. For example, our browsing history is used to detect targeted ads or even identify which attribute or user action triggered a specific ad. Olejnik et al. noticed that, with just 4 visited websites, it is possible to uniquely identify users in 97% of cases. At the same time, Web users are concerned about third-party tracking, especially about location access and inferring demographics. Researchers have found that people are likely to take actions to protect their privacy, including the payment of a premium fee if needed. And while some websites and tracking companies inform users about their data practices through privacy policies and sometimes provide opt-outs, these measures are insufficient. Today, advancements in web advertising provide new opportunities to trackers and advertisers to extend their visibility. Online ads are rendered dynamically during the load time of the browsed website, most of the time as a result of additional (tracking) JavaScript code that is injected on the fly. This opens the door to more sophisticated tracking techniques, among which we find mouse cursor tracking to be an underestimated one. In fact, today most websites include analytics scripts, and a large number of them contains some mouse tracking script. Users consider ad targeting useful because it highlights relevant information, but at the same time they find the underlying data collection alarming and invasive. Plane et al. found that users were more concerned if an ad was targeted based on demographics, such as age, gender, or race, than based on interests. Overall, users do not want targeted advertising when they are made aware of the data collection methods employed by the advertisers, and consider targeting based on demographics to be discriminatory. We, therefore, hypothesize that it could be possible to derive demographics information from mouse movements at scale, and that a privacy issue may emerge if people follow unethical practices and make an uncontrolled use of the technology."], "paper/32/2101.09087/main.jsonl/37": ["Therefore, we noticed an unprecedented low entry barrier for webmasters interested in profiling the user on their websites with no effort, highlighting thus a disconcerting privacy issue.

First, it aims at raising awareness on the emerging privacy threats in the online world and exposes some of the unaccounted ---yet sizeable risks--- of tracking technologies. Even when dealing with a seemingly harmless browser activity logging practice, such as the collection of mouse cursor coordinates, a third party can mine this data to uncover personally identifiable information about the users. Second, with this work we intend to give control back to the users over their (mouse) data. We are certainly not the first ones in aiming at this goal, though, to the best of our knowledge, our proposed adversarial noise technique is the first countermeasure against user profiling based on mouse cursor tracking. We note, however, that our method will not prevent ``any and all'' profiling techniques within mouse tracking, as the field of adversarial machine learning progresses rapidly and new counter-countermeasures are likely to appear in the future. Researchers have proposed restricting access to only the features which are necessary for delivering a desired functionality~\\cite{Snyder17}, enforcing thus a principle of least privilege~\\cite{Denning76}. Google Chrome have recently announced a new technical proposal named ``privacy budget'' that could restore the balance between user privacy and ad targeting on the Web. With a privacy budget, websites could call APIs until those calls have revealed enough information, to narrow a user down to a group sufficiently large enough to maintain anonymity. After that, any further attempts to call such APIs would cause the browser to intervene and block further calls. Under this scenario, we could imagine a user-configurable privacy budget for mouse tracking data, though a set of sane defaults should be provided by browser vendors. For example, if a JavaScript function is listening to the \\texttt{onmousemove} event more than $N$ seconds in a row, the browser would block further calls to the listener function.

Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.\n\nThe first algorithm for random decision forests was created by Tin Kam Ho using the random subspace method, which, in Ho's formulation, is a way to implement the \"stochastic discrimination\" approach to classification proposed by Eugene Kleinberg.\n\nAn extension of the algorithm was developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, who registered \"Random Forests\" as a trademark (, owned by Minitab, Inc.). The extension combines Breiman's \"bagging\" idea and random selection of features, introduced first by Ho and later independently by Amit and Geman in order to construct a collection of decision trees with controlled variance.\n\nThe general method of random decision forests was first proposed by Ho in 1995. Ho established that forests of trees splitting with oblique hyperplanes can gain accuracy as they grow without suffering from overtraining, as long as the forests are randomly restricted to be sensitive to only selected feature dimensions. A subsequent work along the same lines concluded that other splitting methods, as long as they are randomly forced to be insensitive to some feature dimensions, behave similarly. Note that this observation of a more complex classifier (a larger forest) getting more accurate nearly monotonically is in sharp contrast to the common belief that the complexity of a classifier can only grow to a certain level of accuracy before being hurt by overfitting. The explanation of the forest method's resistance to overtraining can be found in Kleinberg's theory of stochastic discrimination.\n\nThe early development of Breiman's notion of random forests was influenced by the work of Amit and Geman who introduced the idea of searching over a random subset of the available decisions when splitting a node, in the context of growing a single tree. The idea of random subspace selection from Ho was also influential in the design of random forests. In this method a forest of trees is grown, and variation among the trees is introduced by projecting the training data into a randomly chosen subspace before fitting each tree or each node. Finally, the idea of randomized node optimization, where the decision at each node is selected by a randomized procedure, rather than a deterministic optimization was first introduced by Dietterich.\n\nDecision trees are a popular method for various machine learning tasks. Tree learning \"come[s] closest to meeting the requirements for serving as an off-the-shelf procedure for data mining\", say Hastie \"et al.\", \"because it is invariant under scaling and various other transformations of feature values, is robust to inclusion of irrelevant features, and produces inspectable models. However, they are seldom accurate\".\n\nIn particular, trees that are grown very deep tend to learn highly irregular patterns: they overfit their training sets, i.e. have low bias, but very high variance. Random forests are a way of averaging multiple deep decision trees, trained on different parts of the same training set, with the goal of reducing the variance. This comes at the expense of a small increase in the bias and some loss of interpretability, but generally greatly boosts the performance in the final model.\n\nThe training algorithm for random forests applies the general technique of bootstrap aggregating, or bagging, to tree learners. Given a training set = , ..., with responses = , ..., , bagging repeatedly (\"B\" times) selects a random sample with replacement of the training set and fits trees to these samples:\n\nAfter training, predictions for unseen samples can be made by averaging the predictions from all the individual regression trees on : or by taking the majority vote in the case of classification trees. This bootstrapping procedure leads to better model performance because it decreases the variance of the model, without increasing the bias. This means that while the predictions of a single tree are highly sensitive to noise in its training set, the average of many trees is not, as long as the trees are not correlated. Simply training many trees on a single training set would give strongly correlated trees (or even the same tree many times, if the training algorithm is deterministic); bootstrap sampling is a way of de-correlating the trees by showing them different training sets.", "::::Properties.:Relationship to nearest neighbors.\nA relationship between random forests and the -nearest neighbor algorithm (-NN) was pointed out by Lin and Jeon in 2002. It turns out that both can be viewed as so-called \"weighted neighborhoods schemes\". These are models built from a training set formula_10 that make predictions formula_11 for new points by looking at the \"neighborhood\" of the point, formalized by a weight function :\nHere, formula_13 is the non-negative weight of the 'th training point relative to the new point in the same tree. For any particular , the weights for points formula_14 must sum to one. Weight functions are given as follows:\nBULLET::::- In -NN, the weights are formula_15 if is one of the points closest to , and zero otherwise.\nBULLET::::- In a tree, formula_16 if is one of the points in the same leaf as , and zero otherwise.\nSince a forest averages the predictions of a set of trees with individual weight functions formula_17, its predictions are\nThis shows that the whole forest is again a weighted neighborhood scheme, with weights that average those of the individual trees. The neighbors of in this interpretation are the points formula_14 sharing the same leaf in any tree formula_7. In this way, the neighborhood of depends in a complex way on the structure of the trees, and thus on the structure of the training set. Lin and Jeon show that the shape of the neighborhood used by a random forest adapts to the local importance of each feature.\nSection::::Unsupervised learning with random forests.\nAs part of their construction, random forest predictors naturally lead to a dissimilarity measure among the observations. One can also define a random forest dissimilarity measure between unlabeled data: the idea is to construct a random forest predictor that distinguishes the \u201cobserved\u201d data from suitably generated synthetic data.\nThe observed data are the original unlabeled data and the synthetic data are drawn from a reference distribution. A random forest dissimilarity can be attractive because it handles mixed variable types very well, is invariant to monotonic transformations of the input variables, and is robust to outlying observations. The random forest dissimilarity easily deals with a large number of semi-continuous variables due to its intrinsic variable selection; for example, the \"Addcl 1\" random forest dissimilarity weighs the contribution of each variable according to how dependent it is on other variables. The random forest dissimilarity has been used in a variety of applications, e.g. to find clusters of patients based on tissue marker data."], "wikipedia-22192834": ["Random forest, a machine-learning classifier based on choosing random subsets of variables for each tree and using the most frequent tree output as the overall classification"]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Wikipedia pages on topics like \"Web tracking,\" \"Behavioral targeting,\" and \"Computer mouse\" could provide relevant information on how mouse tracking (e.g., cursor movements, clicks) might infringe on user privacy by enabling behavioral profiling. Similarly, discussions on keystroke logging or input tracking could help explain why preventing keyboard-based profiling might be more critical, as it can reveal sensitive personal data (e.g., passwords, typed messages). However, Wikipedia may not have a direct comparison of the two risks, so additional sources might be needed for a deeper analysis.", "wikipedia-33924304": ["When mouse tracking takes place without the user's consent, for example on a website, there may be privacy implications."], "wikipedia-1228060": ["Moreover, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer potentially more intrusive details about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.", "The process of \"profiling\" (also known as \"tracking\") assembles and analyzes several events, each attributable to a single originating entity, in order to gain information (especially patterns of activity) relating to the originating entity. Some organizations engage in the profiling of people's web browsing, collecting the URLs of sites visited. The resulting profiles can potentially link with information that personally identifies the individual who did the browsing.\n\nProfiling becomes a more contentious privacy issue when data-matching associates the profile of an individual with personally-identifiable information of the individual.\n\nFlash cookies, also known as Local Shared Objects, work the same ways as normal cookies and are used by the Adobe Flash Player to store information at the user's computer. They exhibit a similar privacy risk as normal cookies, but are not as easily blocked, meaning that the option in most browsers to not accept cookies does not affect Flash cookies. One way to view and control them is with browser extensions or add-ons. \n\nFlash cookies are unlike HTTP cookies in a sense that they are not transferred from the client back to the server. Web browsers read and write these cookies and can track any data by web usage.\n\nDevice fingerprinting is a fairly new technology that is useful in fraud prevention and safeguarding any information from one's computer. Device fingerprinting uses data from the device and browser sessions to determine the risk of conducting business with the person using the device. This technology allows companies to better assess the risks when business is conducted through sites that include, e-commerce sites, social networking and online dating sites and banks and other financial institutions. Due to the growing number of hackers and fraudsters using 'botnets' of millions of computers that are being unknowingly controlled, this technology will help not only the companies at risk but the people who are unaware their computers are being used.\n\nIt is difficult to surf the web without being tracked by device fingerprinting today. However, for people who do not want device fingerprinting, there are ways to attempt to block fingerprinting. The only ways to stop device fingerprinting cause web browsing to be very slow and websites to display information incorrectly. \"There are not convenient options for privacy when it comes to device fingerprinting\" said Peter Eckersely a staff scientist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and privacy-advocacy group. Trying to avoid device fingerprinting is mostly just impractical and inconvenient. Fingerprints are tough to avoid because they are taken from data that are routinely passed from computers to websites automatically. Even if someone changes something slightly, the fingerprinters can still recognize the machine. There is one way to figure out that a device is being fingerprinted. The software JavaScript can be used to collect fingerprinting data. If it asks a browser for specific information, that could be a clue that a fingerprinter is working."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Mark Zuckerberg has also called it a \"very positive step for the Internet\", and has called for GDPR-style laws to be adopted in the US.

AOL created animated cartoons in 2008 to explain to its users that their past actions may determine the content of ads they see in the future. Canadian academics at the University of Ottawa Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic have recently demanded the federal privacy commissioner to investigate online profiling of Internet users for targeted advertising.\nThe European Commission (via commissioner Meglena Kuneva) has also raised a number of concerns related to online data collection (of personal data), profiling and behavioral targeting, and is looking for \"enforcing existing regulation\".\nIn October 2009 it was reported that a recent survey carried out by University of Pennsylvania and the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology found that a large majority of US internet users rejected the use of behavioral advertising.\nSeveral research efforts by academics and others have demonstrated that data that is supposedly anonymized can be used to identify real individuals.\nIn December 2010, online tracking firm Quantcast agreed to pay $2.4M to settle a class action lawsuit for their use of 'zombie' cookies to track consumers. These zombie cookies, which were on partner sites such as MTV, Hulu, and ESPN, would re-generate to continue tracking the user even if they were deleted. Other uses of such technology include Facebook, and their use of the Facebook Beacon to track users across the internet, to later use for more targeted advertising. Tracking mechanisms without consumer consent are generally frowned upon; however, tracking of consumer behavior online or on mobile devices are key to digital advertising, which is the financial backbone to most of the internet.\nIn March 2011, it was reported that the online ad industry would begin working with the Council of Better Business Bureaus to start policing itself as part of its program to monitor and regulate how marketers track consumers online, also known as behavioral advertising."], "wikipedia-22723009": ["BULLET::::- General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR"]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

As anti-keyloggers have been designed specifically to detect keyloggers, they have the potential to be more effective than conventional antivirus software; some antivirus software do not consider a keylogger to be a virus, as under some circumstances a keylogger can be considered a legitimate piece of software.\nSection::::Countermeasures.:Live CD/USB.\nRebooting the computer using a Live CD or write-protected Live USB is a possible countermeasure against software keyloggers if the CD is clean of malware and the operating system contained on it is secured and fully patched so that it cannot be infected as soon as it is started. Booting a different operating system does not impact the use of a hardware or BIOS based keylogger.\nSection::::Countermeasures.:Anti-spyware / Anti-virus programs.\nMany anti-spyware applications are able to detect some software based keyloggers and quarantine, disable or cleanse them. However, because many keylogging programs are legitimate pieces of software under some circumstances, anti spyware often neglects to label keylogging programs as spyware or a virus. These applications are able to detect software-based keyloggers based on patterns in executable code, heuristics and keylogger behaviours (such as the use of hooks and certain APIs).\nNo software-based anti-spyware application can be 100% effective against all keyloggers.\nAlso, software-based anti-spyware cannot defeat non-software keyloggers (for example, hardware keyloggers attached to keyboards will always receive keystrokes before any software-based anti-spyware application).\nHowever, the particular technique that the anti-spyware application uses will influence its potential effectiveness against software keyloggers. As a general rule, anti-spyware applications with higher privileges will defeat keyloggers with lower privileges. For example, a hook-based anti-spyware application cannot defeat a kernel-based keylogger (as the keylogger will receive the keystroke messages before the anti-spyware application), but it could potentially defeat hook- and API-based keyloggers.\nSection::::Countermeasures.:Network monitors.\nNetwork monitors (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from \"phoning home\" with his or her typed information.\nSection::::Countermeasures.:Automatic form filler programs.\nAutomatic form-filling programs may prevent keylogging by removing the requirement for a user to type personal details and passwords using the keyboard. Form fillers are primarily designed for web browsers to fill in checkout pages and log users into their accounts. Once the user's account and credit card information has been entered into the program, it will be automatically entered into forms without ever using the keyboard or clipboard, thereby reducing the possibility that private data is being recorded. However someone with physical access to the machine may still be able to install software that is able to intercept this information elsewhere in the operating system or while in transit on the network. (Transport Layer Security (TLS) reduces the risk that data in transit may be intercepted by network sniffers and proxy tools.)\nSection::::Countermeasures.:One-time passwords (OTP).\nUsing one-time passwords may be keylogger-safe, as each password is invalidated as soon as it is used. This solution may be useful for someone", "Section::::Countermeasures.:Security tokens.\nUse of smart cards or other security tokens may improve security against replay attacks in the face of a successful keylogging attack, as accessing protected information would require both the (hardware) security token \"as well as\" the appropriate password/passphrase. Knowing the keystrokes, mouse actions, display, clipboard etc. used on one computer will not subsequently help an attacker gain access to the protected resource. Some security tokens work as a type of hardware-assisted one-time password system, and others implement a cryptographic challenge-response authentication, which can improve security in a manner conceptually similar to one time passwords. Smartcard readers and their associated keypads for PIN entry may be vulnerable to keystroke logging through a so-called supply chain attack where an attacker substitutes the card reader/PIN entry hardware for one which records the user's PIN.\nSection::::Countermeasures.:On-screen keyboards.\nMost on-screen keyboards (such as the on-screen keyboard that comes with Windows XP) send normal keyboard event messages to the external target program to type text. Software key loggers can log these typed characters sent from one program to another.\nAdditionally, keylogging software can take screenshots of what is displayed on the screen (periodically, and/or upon each mouse click), which means that although certainly a useful security measure, an on-screen keyboard will not protect from all keyloggers.\nSection::::Countermeasures.:Keystroke interference software.\nKeystroke interference software is also available.\nThese programs attempt to trick keyloggers by introducing random keystrokes, although this simply results in the keylogger recording more information than it needs to. An attacker has the task of extracting the keystrokes of interest\u2014the security of this mechanism, specifically how well it stands up to cryptanalysis, is unclear.\nSection::::Countermeasures.:Speech recognition.\nSimilar to on-screen keyboards, speech-to-text conversion software can also be used against keyloggers, since there are no typing or mouse movements involved. The weakest point of using voice-recognition software may be how the software sends the recognized text to target software after the recognition took place.\nSection::::Countermeasures.:Handwriting recognition and mouse gestures.\nAlso, many PDAs and lately tablet PCs can already convert pen (also called stylus) movements on their touchscreens to computer understandable text successfully. Mouse gestures use this principle by using mouse movements instead of a stylus. Mouse gesture programs convert these strokes to user-definable actions, such as typing text. Similarly, graphics tablets and light pens can be used to input these gestures, however these are less common everyday.\nThe same potential weakness of speech recognition applies to this technique as well.\nSection::::Countermeasures.:Macro expanders/recorders.\nWith the help of many programs, a seemingly meaningless text can be expanded to a meaningful text and most of the time context-sensitively, e.g. \"en.wikipedia.org\" can be expanded when a web browser window has the focus. The biggest weakness of this technique is that these programs send their keystrokes directly to the target program. However, this can be overcome by using the 'alternating' technique described below, i.e. sending mouse clicks to non-responsive areas of the target program, sending meaningless keys, sending another mouse click to target area (e.g. password field) and switching back-and-forth.\nSection::::Countermeasures.:Deceptive typing.\nAlternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window can cause a keylogger to record more information than they need to, although this could easily be filtered out by an attacker. Similarly, a user can move their cursor using the mouse during typing, causing the logged keystrokes to be in the wrong order e.g., by typing a password beginning with the last letter and then using the mouse to move the cursor for each subsequent letter. Lastly, someone can also use context menus to remove, cut, copy, and paste parts of the typed text without using the keyboard. An attacker who is able to capture only parts of a password will have a larger key space to attack if he chose to execute a brute-force attack.\nAnother very similar technique uses the fact that any selected text portion is replaced by the next key typed. e.g., if the password is \"secret\", one could type \"s\", then some dummy keys \"asdfsd\". Then, these dummies could be selected with the mouse, and the next character from the password \"e\" is typed, which replaces the dummies \"asdfsd\".\nThese techniques assume incorrectly that keystroke logging software cannot directly monitor the clipboard, the selected text in a form, or take a screenshot every time a keystroke or mouse click occurs. They may however be effective against some hardware keyloggers."], "wikipedia-4765094": ["Other approaches broadcast light energy to confuse the missile infrared sensors. In one example, light energy emitted by non-coherent flashlamps is directed toward the missile sensors, to confuse them and render them ineffective (\"jamming\"). IR missiles are vulnerable to high-powered IR carrier signals which blind the IR detector of the incoming IR missile. In addition, IR missiles are vulnerable to lower-powered IR carrier signals that are modulated using certain modulating signals that confuse its tracking system and cause the tracking system to track a false target.\nConventional countermeasures to an IR missile threat include jamming systems which confuse or blind the IR missile using either IR lamps and/or IR lasers. These jamming systems transmit either a high-powered IR carrier signal to blind the IR detector of the incoming IR missile or transmit a lower-powered IR carrier signal modulated with a modulating signal to confuse the IR detector of the incoming missile.\nDIRCM, or Directional Infrared Countermeasures, avoid this potential drawback by mounting the energy source on a movable turret (much like a FLIR turret). They only operate when cued by a missile warning system of a missile launch, and use the missile plume to accurately aim at the missile seeker. The modulated signal can then be directed at the seeker, and the modulation scheme can be cycled to try to defeat a variety of seekers. Countermeasure success depends on a threat's tracking techniques and requires a proper analysis of the missile's capabilities. Defeating advanced tracking systems requires a higher level of DIRCM power. Issues of Laser Safety are also taken into account.\nIsrael has announced a program to develop a system called Multi Spectral Infrared Countermeasure (MUSIC) that will similarly use active lasers instead of flares to protect civilian aircraft against MANPADs. The US Army is deploying a similar system to protect its helicopters.\nThe Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Countermeasures (DoN LAIRCM) by Northrop Grumman provides infrared threat protection for U.S. Marine Corps CH-53E, CH-46E and CH-53D platforms.\nBAE Systems' AN/ALQ-212 advanced threat infrared countermeasures (ATIRCM) - part of a directable infrared countermeasures suite - is fielded on U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook helicopters. The suite provides protection against an array of threats, including all infrared threat bands. The AN/ALQ-212 incorporates one or more infrared jam heads to counter multiple missile attacks.\nAt IDEX 2013, Finmeccanica Company, Selex ES launched its Miysis DIRCM, suitable for all airborne platforms, rotary and fixed wing, large and small.\nCIRCM (Common Infrared Countermeasures) will be a laser based IR countermeasure against current and future IR threat systems for the US Army rotorcraft and fixed wing platforms and US Navy and US Air Force rotorcraft platforms. Systems by BAE Systems, ITT Defense and Information Solutions, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon were under consideration. In August 2015, Northrop Grumman won the contract.\nFlares create infrared targets with a much stronger signature than the aircraft's engines. The flares provide false targets that cause the missile to make incorrect steering decisions. The missile will rapidly break off a target lock-on."], "wikipedia-16547955": ["Section::::Types.:Technical surveillance counter-measures.:Software countermeasures.\nAmidst concerns over privacy, software countermeasures have emerged to prevent cyber-intrusion, the unauthorized act of spying, snooping, and stealing personally identifiable information or other proprietary assets (e.g. images) through cyberspace.\n\nSection::::Types.:Technical surveillance counter-measures.:Human countermeasures.\nMost surveillance, and most countersurveillance, involves human rather than electronic methods since people are generally more vulnerable and more capable of reacting creatively to surveillance situations.\nHuman countermeasures include:\nBULLET::::- Evasion: avoiding risky locations, being discreet or circumspect, using code words\nBULLET::::- Being situation-aware (\"looking over your shoulder\")\nBULLET::::- Leaving the area without being seen or followed e.g. getting \"lost in the crowd\" so that followers lose contact\nBULLET::::- Hiding in secure locations\nBULLET::::- Concealing ones identity\nSuch activities make it harder to track surveillance subjects.

\\texttt{\\small{mousemove}} event programmatically\n$e'_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)$\nwhich is within a $\\sigma$ radius away from the original coordinate.\nThis additive Gaussian noise is also applied to the time offsets,\nto ensure that the distorted trajectory has no duplicated times.\nThe amount of adversarial noise applied to each programmatic event ranges randomly from 0 to

classification performance.\nTheoretically, a random classifier should achieve an AUC score of $0.5$\nfor a two-class classification problem.\nTherefore, we expect to see a degradation in classification performance\nwith regard to the previous experiments.\nGiven that the BiGRU outperformed the RF model\nand relies only on raw mouse movements,\nwe only challenge the BiGRU model in these experiments.\nAs observed in \\autoref{tbl:results_with_noise}, using a radius of $\\sigma=0.25$\\,px\nis enough to degrade the performance of the BiGRU model,\nwhich begins to behave as a random classifier (AUC $\\approx 0.5$)\nof both age and gender.\nThe differences between the original mouse data and the degraded versions\nare statistically significant at the $p < .001$

movement trajectory would become ``illegible'' to any machine learning model\ntrying to classify the user's age or gender.\nThis experiment is inline with previous research that reported\nvery small perturbations to cause a significant performance degradation~\\cite{Prakash18_px}.\nIndeed, by scrambling both spatial and temporal information from a mouse cursor trajectory\nwe are effectively signaling a seemingly arbitrary and jittery movement.\nTo validate further the validity of this adversarial noise,\nwe re-trained our BiGRU model with distorted mouse data,\nusing the same configuration from our previous experiments (\\autoref{sssec:rnn_model}).\nNow each mouse sequence is distorted according to a random uniform distribution $\\sigma \\sim \\mathcal{U}(0,1)$,\nwhich means that some coordinates are preserved ($\\sigma=0$)\nwhereas others are more distorted ($\\sigma=1$).\nThe results are shown in \\autoref{tbl:adversarial-retrain}.\nAs can be observed, the model achieves worse performance\nthan the model trained on the original, non-distorted data,\nsometimes by a large margin.\nThis was especially so for the age classifier.\nWe conclude that the proposed adversarial noise technique is a robust\ncountermeasure against the neural net used as profiling mechanism via mouse cursor tracking.\nWe have implemented this adversarial method in a Chrome extension (see `\\nameref{apx:resources}' section)\nthat allows to configure the adversarial noise level (random uniform by default)\nand the number of \\texttt{\\small{mousemove}} events (one coordinate by default) to be added programmatically.\nThe idea of providing these ``sane defaults'' is to avoid making the mouse movements too distorted\nso as they can go unnoticed by a machine learner trying to
