This test will give out the response times of all the important business critical transactions. The database, application server, etc. are also monitored during the test, this will assist in identifying bottlenecks in the application software and the hardware that the software is installed on.\nSection::::Testing types.:Stress testing.\nStress testing is normally used to understand the upper limits of capacity within the system.

An incremental load is applied over time while the system is monitored for predetermined failure conditions. Breakpoint testing is sometimes referred to as Capacity Testing because it can be said to determine the maximum capacity below which the system will perform to its required specifications or Service Level Agreements.

Varying the number of hidden nodes has also been used to try and reduce interference. However, the findings have been mixed, with some studies finding that more hidden units decrease interference and other studies finding it does not.\nBelow are a number of techniques which have empirical support in successfully reducing catastrophic interference in backpropagation neural networks:\nSection::::Proposed solutions.:Node sharpening technique.\nFrench (1991) proposed that catastrophic interference arises in feedforward backpropagation networks due to the interaction of node activations, or activation overlap, that occur in distributed representations at the hidden layer. Specifically, he defined this activation overlap as the average shared activation over all units in the hidden layer, calculated by summing the lowest activation of the nodes at the hidden layer and averaging this sum. For example, if the activations at the hidden layer from one input are (0.3, 0.1, 0.9, 1.0) and the activations from the next input are (0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.9) the activation overlap would be (0.0 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.9 ) / 4 = 0.275. When using binary representation of input vectors, activation values will be 0 through 1, where 0 indicates no activation overlap and 1 indicates full activation overlap. French noted that neural networks which employ very localized representations do not show catastrophic interference because of the lack of overlap at the hidden layer. That is to say, each input pattern will create a hidden layer representation that involves the activation of only one node, so differed inputs will have an activation overlap of 0. Thus, he suggested that reducing the value of activation overlap at the hidden layer would reduce catastrophic interference in distributed networks. Specifically he proposed that this could be done through changing the distributed representations at the hidden layer to 'semi-distributed' representations. A 'semi-distributed' representation has fewer hidden nodes that are active, and/or a lower activation value for these nodes, for each representation, which will make the representations of the different inputs overlap less at the hidden layer. French recommended that this could be done through 'activation sharpening', a technique which slightly increases the activation of a certain number of the most active nodes in the hidden layer, slightly reduces the activation of all the other units and then changes the input-to-hidden layer weights to reflect these activation changes (similar to error backpropagation). Overall the guidelines for the process of 'activation sharpening' are as follows:\nBULLET::::1. Perform a forward activation pass by feeding an input from the input layer to the hidden layer and record the activations at the hidden layer\nBULLET::::2. \"Sharpen\" the activation of x number of most active nodes by a sharpening factor \u03b1:\nBULLET::::- \"A\" = \"A\" + \"\u03b1\"(1- \"A\") For nodes to be sharpened, i.e. more activated\nBULLET::::- \"A\" = \"A\" \u2013 \"\u03b1A\" For all other nodes\nBULLET::::- French suggested the number of nodes to be sharpened should be log \"n\" nodes, where n is the number of hidden layer nodes\nBULLET::::3. Use the difference between the old activation (A) and the sharpened activation (\"A\") as an error, backpropagate this error to the input layer, and modify the weights of input-to-output appropriately\nBULLET::::4. Do a full forward pass with the input through to the output layer\nBULLET::::5. Backpropagate as usual from the output to the input layer\nBULLET::::6. Repeat\nIn his tests of an 8-8-8 (input-hidden-output) node backpropagation network where one node was sharpened, French found that this sharpening paradigm did result in one node being much more active than the other seven. Moreover, when sharpened, this network took one fourth the time to relearn the initial inputs than a standard backpropagation without node sharpening. Relearning is a measure of memory savings and thus extent of forgetting, where more time to relearn suggests more forgetting (Ebbinghaus savings method). A two-node sharpened network performed even slightly better, however if more than two nodes were sharpened forgetting increased again.\nAccording to French, the sharpened activations interfere less with weights in the network than unsharpened weights and this is due specifically to the way that backpropagation algorithm calculates weight changes. Activations near 0 will change the weights of links less than activations near 1. Consequently, when there are many nodes with low activations (due to sharpening), the weights to and from these nodes will be modified much less than the weights on very active nodes. As a result, when a new input is fed into the network, sharpening will reduce activation overlap by limiting the number of highly active hidden units and will reduce the likelihood of representational overlap by reducing the number of weights that are to be changed. Thus, node sharpening will decrease the amount of disruption in the old weights, which store prior input patterns, thereby reducing the likelihood of catastrophic forgetting.\nSection::::Proposed solutions.:Novelty rule.\nKortge (1990) proposed a learning rule for training neural networks, called the 'novelty rule', to help alleviate catastrophic interference. As its name suggests, this rule helps the neural network to learn only the components of a new input that differ from an old input. Consequently, the novelty rule changes only the weights that were not previously dedicated to storing information, thereby reducing the overlap in representations at the hidden units. Thus, even when inputs are somewhat similar to another, dissimilar representations can be made at the hidden layer. In order to apply the novelty rule, during learning the input pattern is replaced by a novelty vector that represents the components that differ. The novelty vector for the first layer (input units to hidden units) is determined by taking the target pattern away from the current output of the network (the delta rule). For the second layer (hidden units to output units) the novelty vector is simply the activation of the hidden units that resulted from using the novelty vector as an input through the first layer. Weight changes in the network are computed by using a modified delta rule with the novelty vector replacing the activation value (sum of the inputs):\nWhen the novelty rule is used in a standard backpropagation network there is no, or lessened, forgetting of old items when new items are presented sequentially. However, this rule can only apply to auto-encoder or auto-associative networks, in which the target response for the output layer is identical to the input pattern. This is because the novelty vector would be meaningless if the desired output was not identical to the input as it would be impossible to calculate how much a new input differed from the old input.\nSection::::Proposed solutions.:Pre-training networks.\nMcRae and Hetherington (1993) argued that humans, unlike most neural networks, do not take on new learning tasks with a random set of weights. Rather, people tend to bring a wealth of prior knowledge to a task and this helps to avoid the problem of interference. They proposed that when a network is pre-trained on a random sample of data prior to starting a sequential learning task that this prior knowledge will naturally constrain how the new information can be incorporated. This would occur because a random sample of data from a domain which has a high degree of internal structure, such as the English language, training would capture the regularities, or recurring patterns, found within that domain. Since the domain is based on regularities, a newly learned item will tend to be similar to the previously learned information, which will allow the network to incorporate new data with little interference with existing data. Specifically, an input vector which follows the same pattern of regularities as the previously trained data should not cause a drastically different pattern of activation at the hidden layer or drastically alter weights."], "wikipedia-21523": ["A key trigger for renewed interest in neural networks and learning was Werbos's (1975) backpropagation algorithm that made the training of multi-layer networks feasible and efficient.

Over the course of a few iterations, each parents' outputs may converge with the predictions of some children and diverge from those of others, meaning that that parent is present or absent from the scene.\n\nFor each possible parent, each child computes a prediction vector by multiplying its output by a weight matrix (trained by backpropagation). Next the output of the parent is computed as the scalar product of a prediction with a coefficient representing the probability that this child belongs to that parent. A child whose predictions are relatively close to the resulting output successively increases the coefficient between that parent and child and decreases it for parents that it matches less well. This increases the contribution that that child makes to that parent, thus increasing the scalar product of the capsule\u2019s prediction with the parent\u2019s output. After a few iterations, the coefficients strongly connect a parent to its most likely children, indicating that the presence of the children imply the presence of the parent in the scene.

The pose of the parent (reflected in its output) progressively becomes compatible with that of its children.\n\nThe coefficients' initial logits are the log prior probabilities that a child belongs to a parent. The priors can be trained discriminatively along with the weights. The priors depend on the location and type of the child and parent capsules, but not on the current input.

Self-learning resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.\n\nIn the late 1940s psychologist Donald Hebb created a hypothesis of learning based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that is now known as Hebbian learning. Hebbian learning is considered to be a 'typical' unsupervised learning rule and its later variants were early models for long term potentiation. These ideas started being applied to computational models in 1948 with Turing's B-type machines.\n\nFarley and Clark (1954) first used computational machines, then called calculators, to simulate a Hebbian network at MIT. Other neural network computational machines were created by Rochester, Holland, Habit, and Duda (1956).\n\nRosenblatt (1958) created the perceptron, an algorithm for pattern recognition based on a two-layer learning computer network using simple addition and subtraction. With mathematical notation, Rosenblatt also described circuitry not in the basic perceptron, such as the exclusive-or circuit, a circuit whose mathematical computation could not be processed until after the backpropagation algorithm was created by Werbos (1975).\n\nNeural network research stagnated after the publication of machine learning research by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert (1969). They discovered two key issues with the computational machines that processed neural networks. The first issue was that single-layer neural networks were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. The second significant issue was that computers were not sophisticated enough to effectively handle the long run time required by large neural networks. Neural network research slowed until computers achieved greater processing power. Also key in later advances was the backpropagation algorithm which effectively solved the exclusive-or problem (Werbos 1975).\n\nThe parallel distributed processing of the mid-1980s became popular under the name connectionism. The text by Rumelhart and McClelland (1986) provided a full exposition on the use of connectionism in computers to simulate neural processes.\n\nAn artificial neural network involves a network of simple processing elements (artificial neurons) which can exhibit complex global behavior, determined by the connections between the processing elements and element parameters. Artificial neurons were first proposed in 1943 by Warren McCulloch, a neurophysiologist, and Walter Pitts, a logician, who first collaborated at the University of Chicago.\n\nThe utility of artificial neural network models lies in the fact that they can be used to infer a function from observations and also to use it. Unsupervised neural networks can also be used to learn representations of the input that capture the salient characteristics of the input distribution, e.g., see the Boltzmann machine (1983), and more recently, deep learning algorithms, which can implicitly learn the distribution function of the observed data. Learning in neural networks is particularly useful in applications where the complexity of the data or task makes the design of such functions by hand impractical."], "wikipedia-35699507": ["An artificial neural network's learning rule or learning process is a method, mathematical logic or algorithm which improves the network's performance and/or training time. Usually, this rule is applied repeatedly over the network. It is done by updating the levels of a network when a network is simulated in a specific data environment. A learning rule may accept existing conditions (weights and biases) of the network and will compare the expected result and actual result of the network to give new and improved values for weights and bias. Depending on the complexity of actual model being simulated, the learning rule of the network can be as simple as an XOR gate or mean squared error, or as complex as the result of a system of differential equations."], "wikipedia-50073184": ["The \"generative\" network generates candidates while the \"discriminative\" network evaluates them.

The generative network's training objective is to increase the error rate of the discriminative network (i.e., \"fool\" the discriminator network by producing novel candidates that the discriminator thinks are not synthesized (are part of the true data distribution)).\nA known dataset serves as the initial training data for the discriminator. Training it involves presenting it with samples from the training dataset, until it achieves acceptable accuracy. The generator trains based on whether it succeeds in fooling the discriminator. Typically the generator is seeded with randomized input that is sampled from a predefined latent space (e.g. a multivariate normal distribution). Thereafter, candidates synthesized by the generator are evaluated by the discriminator.

It then identifies temporal sequences of spatial patterns that are likely to occur one after another.\n\nDuring \"training\", a node (or region) receives a temporal sequence of spatial patterns as its input. The learning process consists of two stages:\nBULLET::::1. The spatial pooling identifies (in the input) frequently observed patterns and memorizes them as \"coincidences\". Patterns that are significantly similar to each other are treated as the same coincidence. A large number of possible input patterns are reduced to a manageable number of known coincidences.\nBULLET::::2. The temporal pooling partitions coincidences that are likely to follow each other in the training sequence into temporal groups. Each group of patterns represents a \"cause\" of the input pattern (or \"name\" in \"On Intelligence\").\n\nThe second generation of HTM learning algorithms, often referred to as cortical learning algorithms (CLA), was drastically different from zeta 1. It relies on a data structure called sparse distributed representations (that is, a data structure whose elements are binary, 1 or 0, and whose number of 1 bits is small compared to the number of 0 bits) to represent the brain activity and a more biologically-realistic neuron model (often also referred to as cell, in the context of the HTM theory). There are two core components in this HTM theory: a spatial pooling algorithm, which outputs sparse distributed representations (SDR), and a sequence memory algorithm, which learns to represent and predict complex sequences.\n\nIn this new generation, the layers and minicolumns of the cerebral cortex are addressed and partially modeled. Each HTM layer (not to be confused with an HTM level of an HTM hierarchy, as described above) consists of a number of highly interconnected minicolumns. An HTM layer creates a sparse distributed representation from its input, so that a fixed percentage of \"minicolumns\" are active at any one time. A minicolumn is understood as a group of cells that have the same receptive field. Each minicolumn has a number of cells that are able to remember several previous states. A cell can be in one of three states: \"active\", \"inactive\" and \"predictive\" state.\n\nThe receptive field of each minicolumn is a fixed number of inputs that are randomly selected from a much larger number of node inputs. Based on the (specific) input pattern, some minicolumns will be more or less associated with the active input values. Spatial pooling selects a relatively constant number of the most active minicolumns and inactivates (inhibits) other minicolumns in the vicinity of the active ones. Similar input patterns tend to activate a stable set of minicolumns. The amount of memory used by each layer can be increased to learn more complex spatial patterns or decreased to learn simpler patterns.\n\nAs mentioned above, a cell (or a neuron) of a minicolumn, at any point in time, can be in an active, inactive or predictive state. Initially, cells are inactive.\n\nIf one or more cells in the active minicolumn are in the \"predictive\" state (see below), they will be the only cells to become active in the current time step. If none of the cells in the active minicolumn are in the predictive state (which happens during the initial time step or when the activation of this minicolumn was not expected), all cells are made active.\n\nWhen a cell becomes active, it gradually forms connections to nearby cells that tend to be active during several previous time steps. Thus a cell learns to recognize a known sequence by checking whether the connected cells are active.

The gradient formula_6 has the simple form formula_7 where formula_8 represent averages with respect to distribution formula_9. The issue arises in sampling formula_10 because this requires extended alternating Gibbs sampling. CD replaces this step by running alternating Gibbs sampling for formula_11 steps (values of formula_12 perform well). After formula_11 steps, the data are sampled and that sample is used in place of formula_10. The CD procedure works as follows:\nBULLET::::1. Initialize the visible units to a training vector.\nBULLET::::2. Update the hidden units in parallel given the visible units: formula_15. formula_16 is the sigmoid function and formula_17 is the bias of formula_18.\nBULLET::::3. Update the visible units in parallel given the hidden units: formula_19. formula_20 is the bias of formula_21. This is called the \"reconstruction\" step.\nBULLET::::4. Re-update the hidden units in parallel given the reconstructed visible units using the same equation as in step 2.\nBULLET::::5. Perform the weight update: formula_22."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-1360091": 2, "wikipedia-1514392": 1, "wikipedia-40678189": 1, "wikipedia-21523": 2, "wikipedia-41978562": 1, "wikipedia-1645603": 1, "wikipedia-43930834": 1, "wikipedia-60992857": 1, "wikipedia-33742232": 2, "wikipedia-41416740": 2}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-1360091": 3, "wikipedia-1514392": 1, "wikipedia-40678189": 1, "wikipedia-21523": 3, "wikipedia-41978562": 1, "wikipedia-1645603": 1, "wikipedia-43930834": 1, "wikipedia-60992857": 2, "wikipedia-33742232": 3, "wikipedia-41416740": 3}}}

For more specialized or technical details, additional sources might be needed.", "wikipedia-2534867": ["Objective video quality models are mathematical models that approximate results from subjective quality assessment, in which human observers are asked to rate the quality of a video. In this context, the term \"model\" may refer to a simple statistical model in which several independent variables (e.g. the packet loss rate on a network and the video coding parameters) are fit against results obtained in a subjective quality evaluation test using regression techniques. A model may also be a more complicated algorithm implemented in software or hardware.\n\nBULLET::::- Full Reference Methods (FR): FR models compute the quality difference by comparing the original video signal against the received video signal. Typically, every pixel from the source is compared against the corresponding pixel at the received video, with no knowledge about the encoding or transmission process in between. More elaborate algorithms may choose to combine the pixel-based estimation with other approaches such as described below. FR models are usually the most accurate at the expense of higher computational effort. As they require availability of the original video before transmission or coding, they cannot be used in all situations (e.g., where the quality is measured from a client device).\nBULLET::::- Reduced Reference Methods (RR): RR models extract some features of both videos and compare them to give a quality score. They are used when all the original video is not available, or when it would be practically impossible to do so, e.g. in a transmission with a limited bandwidth. This makes them more efficient than FR models at the expense of lower accuracy.\nBULLET::::- No-Reference Methods (NR): NR models try to assess the quality of a distorted video without any reference to the original signal. Due to the absence of an original signal, they may be less accurate than FR or RR approaches, but are more efficient to compute.\nBULLET::::- Pixel-Based Methods (NR-P): Pixel-based models use a decoded representation of the signal and analyze the quality based on the pixel information. Some of these evaluate specific degradation types only, such as blurring or other coding artifacts.\nBULLET::::- Parametric/Bitstream Methods (NR-B): These models make use of features extracted from the transmission container and/or video bitstream, e.g. MPEG-TS packet headers, motion vectors and quantization parameters. They do not have access to the original signal and require no decoding of the video, which makes them more efficient. In contrast to NR-P models, they have no access to the final decoded signal. However, the picture quality predictions they deliver are not very accurate.\nBULLET::::- Hybrid Methods (Hybrid NR-P-B): Hybrid models combine parameters extracted from the bitstream with a decoded video signal. They are therefore a mix between NR-P and NR-B models.\n\nThe most traditional ways of evaluating quality of digital video processing system (e.g. a video codec) are FR-based. Among the oldest FR metrics are signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which are calculated between every frame of the original and the degraded video signal. PSNR is the most widely used objective image quality metric, and the average PSNR over all frames can be considered a video quality metric. PSNR is also used often during video codec development in order to optimize encoders. However, PSNR values do not correlate well with perceived picture quality due to the complex, highly non-linear behavior of the human visual system.\n\nWith the success of digital video, a large number of more precise FR metrics have been developed. These metrics are inherently more complex than PSNR, and need more computational effort to calculate predictions of video quality. Among those metrics specifically developed for video are VQM and the MOVIE Index.\n\nBased on the results of benchmarks by the Video Quality Experts Group (VQEG) (some in the course of the Multimedia Test Phase (2007\u20132008) and the HDTV Test Phase I (2009\u20132011)), some RR/FR metrics have been standardized in ITU-T as:\nBULLET::::- ITU-T Rec.

It is not generally possible to send more data than dictated by the Shannon-Hartley Theorem.\nSection::::Performance measures.:Throughput.\n\"Throughput\" is the number of messages successfully delivered per unit time. Throughput is controlled by available bandwidth, as well as the available signal-to-noise ratio and hardware limitations. Throughput for the purpose of this article will be understood to be measured from the arrival of the first bit of data at the receiver, to decouple the concept of throughput from the concept of latency. For discussions of this type the terms 'throughput' and 'bandwidth' are often used interchangeably.\nThe \"Time Window\" is the period over which the throughput is measured. Choice of an appropriate time window will often dominate calculations of throughput, and whether latency is taken into account or not will determine whether the latency affects the throughput or not.\nSection::::Performance measures.:Latency.\nThe speed of light imposes a minimum propagation time on all electromagnetic signals. It is not possible to reduce the latency below\nwhere s is the distance and c is the speed of light in the medium. This approximately means 1 extra millisecond roundtrip time (RTT) for 100 km/62miles of distance between hosts.\nOther delays also occur in intermediate nodes. In packet switched networks delays can occur due to queueing.\nSection::::Performance measures.:Jitter.\nJitter is the undesired deviation from true periodicity of an assumed periodic signal in electronics and telecommunications, often in relation to a reference clock source. Jitter may be observed in characteristics such as the frequency of successive pulses, the signal amplitude, or phase of periodic signals. Jitter is a significant, and usually undesired, factor in the design of almost all communications links (e.g., USB, PCI-e, SATA, OC-48). In clock recovery applications it is called \"timing jitter\".\nSection::::Performance measures.:Error rate.\nIn digital transmission, the number of bit errors is the number of received bits of a data stream over a communication channel that have been altered due to noise, interference, distortion or bit synchronization errors.\nThe bit error rate or bit error ratio (BER) is the number of bit errors divided by the total number of transferred bits during a studied time interval. BER is a unitless performance measure, often expressed as a percentage.\nThe bit error probability \"p\" is the expectation value of the BER. The BER can be considered as an approximate estimate of the bit error probability.

It is not generally possible to send more data than dictated by the Shannon-Hartley Theorem.\nSection::::Performance measures.:Throughput.\n\"Throughput\" is the number of messages successfully delivered per unit time. Throughput is controlled by available bandwidth, as well as the available signal-to-noise ratio and hardware limitations. Throughput for the purpose of this article will be understood to be measured from the arrival of the first bit of data at the receiver, to decouple the concept of throughput from the concept of latency. For discussions of this type the terms 'throughput' and 'bandwidth' are often used interchangeably.\nThe \"Time Window\" is the period over which the throughput is measured. Choice of an appropriate time window will often dominate calculations of throughput, and whether latency is taken into account or not will determine whether the latency affects the throughput or not.\nSection::::Performance measures.:Latency.\nThe speed of light imposes a minimum propagation time on all electromagnetic signals. It is not possible to reduce the latency below\nwhere s is the distance and c is the speed of light in the medium. This approximately means 1 extra millisecond roundtrip time (RTT) for 100 km/62miles of distance between hosts.\nOther delays also occur in intermediate nodes. In packet switched networks delays can occur due to queueing.\nSection::::Performance measures.:Jitter.\nJitter is the undesired deviation from true periodicity of an assumed periodic signal in electronics and telecommunications, often in relation to a reference clock source. Jitter may be observed in characteristics such as the frequency of successive pulses, the signal amplitude, or phase of periodic signals. Jitter is a significant, and usually undesired, factor in the design of almost all communications links (e.g., USB, PCI-e, SATA, OC-48). In clock recovery applications it is called \"timing jitter\".\nSection::::Performance measures.:Error rate.\nIn digital transmission, the number of bit errors is the number of received bits of a data stream over a communication channel that have been altered due to noise, interference, distortion or bit synchronization errors.\nThe bit error rate or bit error ratio (BER) is the number of bit errors divided by the total number of transferred bits during a studied time interval. BER is a unitless performance measure, often expressed as a percentage.\nThe bit error probability \"p\" is the expectation value of the BER. The BER can be considered as an approximate estimate of the bit error probability. This estimate is accurate for a long time interval and a high number of bit errors.\nSection::::Performance measures.:Interplay of factors.\nAll of the factors above, coupled with user requirements and user perceptions, play a role in determining the perceived 'fastness' or utility, of a network connection. The relationship between throughput, latency, and user experience is most aptly understood in the context of a shared network medium, and as a scheduling problem.\nSection::::Algorithms and protocols.\nFor some systems, latency and throughput are coupled entities. In TCP/IP, latency can also directly affect throughput. In TCP connections, the large bandwidth-delay product of high latency connections, combined with relatively small TCP window sizes on many devices, effectively causes the throughput of a high latency connection to drop sharply with latency. This can be remedied with various techniques, such as increasing the TCP congestion window size, or more drastic solutions, such as packet coalescing, TCP acceleration, and forward error correction, all of which are commonly used for high latency satellite links.\nTCP acceleration converts the TCP packets into a stream that is similar to UDP. Because of this, the TCP acceleration software must provide its own mechanisms to ensure the reliability of the link, taking the latency and bandwidth of the link into account, and both ends of the high latency link must support the method used.\nIn the Media Access Control (MAC) layer, performance issues such as throughput and end-to-end delay are also addressed."], "wikipedia-11230690": ["As a consequence of the Internet end-to-end principle, the network performance experienced by a particular application is difficult to attribute based on the behavior of the individual elements. At any given moment, the measure of performance between any two points is typically unknown and applications must operate blindly. As a further consequence, changes to the configuration of given element, or changes in the end-to-end path, cannot easily be validated. Optimization and provisioning cannot then be automated except against only the simplest design specifications.\n\nThere is an increasing interest in Autonomic Networking research, and a strong conviction that an evolution from the current networking status quo is necessary. Although to date there have not been any practical implementations demonstrating the benefits of an effective autonomic networking paradigm, there seems to be a consensus as to the characteristics which such implementations would need to demonstrate. These specifically include continuous monitoring, identifying, diagnosing and fixing problems based on high-level policies and objectives.\n\nAutognostics, as a major part of the autonomic networking concept, intends to bring networks to a new level of awareness and eliminate the lack of visibility which currently exists in today's networks.\n\nAutognostics is a new paradigm that describes the capacity for computer networks to be self-aware, in part and as a whole, and dynamically adapt to the applications running on them by autonomously monitoring, identifying, diagnosing, resolving issues, subsequently verifying that any remediation was successful, and reporting the impact with respect to the application\u2019s use (i.e., providing visibility into the changes to networks and their effects).\n\nIn order to achieve autognosis, networks need a means to:\nBULLET::::- Continuously monitor/test the network for application-specific performance\nBULLET::::- Analyze the monitoring/test data to detect problems (e.g., performance degradation)\nBULLET::::- Diagnose, identify and localize sources of degradation\nBULLET::::- Automatically take actions to resolve problems via remediation/provisioning\nBULLET::::- Verify the problems have been resolved (potentially rolling back changes if ineffective)\nBULLET::::- Subsequently continue to monitor/test for performance"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-4886965": 2, "wikipedia-9646826": 1, "wikipedia-31560245": 1, "wikipedia-16300571": 1, "wikipedia-357366": 1, "wikipedia-1522954": 2, "wikipedia-12037783": 1, "wikipedia-11230690": 2, "wikipedia-20005809": 1, "wikipedia-4389080": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-4886965": 3, "wikipedia-9646826": 1, "wikipedia-31560245": 1, "wikipedia-16300571": 1, "wikipedia-357366": 1, "wikipedia-1522954": 3, "wikipedia-12037783": 1, "wikipedia-11230690": 3, "wikipedia-20005809": 1, "wikipedia-4389080": 1}}}

This type of feedback is defined as explicit only when the assessors (or other users of a system) know that the feedback provided is interpreted as relevance judgments.\nUsers may indicate relevance explicitly using a \"binary\" or \"graded\" relevance system. Binary relevance feedback indicates that a document is either relevant or irrelevant for a given query. Graded relevance feedback indicates the relevance of a document to a query on a scale using numbers, letters, or descriptions (such as \"not relevant\", \"somewhat relevant\", \"relevant\", or \"very relevant\"). Graded relevance may also take the form of a cardinal ordering of documents created by an assessor; that is, the assessor places documents of a result set in order of (usually descending) relevance. An example of this would be the SearchWiki feature implemented by Google on their search website.\nThe relevance feedback information needs to be interpolated with the original query to improve retrieval performance, such as the well-known Rocchio algorithm.\nA performance metric which became popular around 2005 to measure the usefulness of a ranking algorithm based on the explicit relevance feedback is NDCG. Other measures include precision at \"k\" and mean average precision.\n\nImplicit feedback is inferred from user behavior, such as noting which documents they do and do not select for viewing, the duration of time spent viewing a document, or page browsing or scrolling actions . There are many signals during the search process that one can use for implicit feedback and the types of information to provide in response\nThe key differences of implicit relevance feedback from that of explicit include :\nBULLET::::1. the user is not assessing relevance for the benefit of the IR system, but only satisfying their own needs and\nBULLET::::2. the user is not necessarily informed that their behavior (selected documents) will be used as relevance feedback\nAn example of this is dwell time, which is a measure of how long a user spends viewing the page linked to in a search result.

The process starts from trying to fit a linear regression model. If the P-value turns out to be low, then a higher degree polynomial regression, which is usually quadratic, will be implemented. The process of finding a good relationship between input and response variables will be done for each simulation test. In simulation optimization, response surface method can be used to find the best input variables that produce desired outcomes in terms of response variables.\nSection::::Simulation-based optimization methods.:Heuristic methods.\nHeuristic methods change accuracy by speed. Their goal is to find a good solution faster than the traditional methods, when they are too slow or fail in solving the problem. Usually they find local optimal instead of the optimal value; however, the values are considered close enough of the final solution. Examples of this kind of method is tabu search or Genetic algorithm.\nMetamodels enable researchers to obtain reliable approximate model outputs without running expensive and time-consuming computer simulations. Therefore, the process of model optimization can take less computation time and cost. \nSection::::Simulation-based optimization methods.:Stochastic approximation.\nStochastic approximation is used when the function cannot be computed directly, only estimated via noisy observations. In this scenarios, this method (or family of methods) looks for the extrema of these function. The objective function would be:\nSection::::Simulation-based optimization methods.:Derivative-free optimization methods.\nDerivative-free optimization is a subject of mathematical optimization. This method is applied to a certain optimization problem when its derivatives are unavailable or unreliable. Derivative-free methods establish a model based on sample function values or directly draw a sample set of function values without exploiting a detailed model. Since it needs no derivatives, it cannot be compared to derivative-based methods.\nFor unconstrained optimization problems, it has the form:\nThe limitations of derivative-free optimization:\n1. It is usually cannot handle optimization problems with a few tens of variables; the results via this method are usually not so accurate.\n2. When confronted with minimizing non-convex functions, it will show its limitation.\n3. Derivative-free optimization methods are simple and easy; however, they are not so good in theory and in practice.\nSection::::Simulation-based optimization methods.:Dynamic programming and neuro-dynamic programming.\nSection::::Simulation-based optimization methods.:Dynamic programming and neuro-dynamic programming.:Dynamic programming.\nDynamic programming deals with situations where decisions are made in stages. The key to this kind of problems is to trade off the present and future costs.\nOne dynamic basic model has two features:\n1) It has a discrete time dynamic system.\n2) The cost function is additive over time.\nFor discrete features, dynamic programming has the form:\nFor the cost function, it has the form:\nformula_14 is the cost at the end of the process.\nAs the cost cannot be optimized meaningfully, it can be used the expect value:\nSection::::Simulation-based optimization methods.:Dynamic programming and neuro-dynamic programming.:Neuro-dynamic programming.\nNeuro-dynamic programming is the same as dynamic programming except that the former has the concept of approximation architectures.

The motivation for backpropagation is to train a multi-layered neural network such that it can learn the appropriate internal representations to allow it to learn any arbitrary mapping of input to output.\n\nTo understand the mathematical derivation of the backpropagation algorithm, it helps to first develop some intuition about the relationship between the actual output of a neuron and the correct output for a particular training example. Consider a simple neural network with two input units, one output unit and no hidden units, and in which each neuron uses a linear output (unlike most work on neural networks, in which mapping from inputs to outputs is non-linear) that is the weighted sum of its input. \n\nInitially, before training, the weights will be set randomly. Then the neuron learns from training examples, which in this case consist of a set of tuples formula_1 where formula_2 and formula_3 are the inputs to the network and is the correct output (the output the network should produce given those inputs, when it has been trained). The initial network, given formula_2 and formula_3, will compute an output that likely differs from (given random weights). A loss function formula_6 is used for measuring the discrepancy between the expected output and the actual output . For regression analysis problems the squared error can be used as a loss function, for classification the categorical crossentropy can be used.\n\nAs an example consider a regression problem using the square error as a loss:\nwhere is the discrepancy or error.\nConsider the network on a single training case: formula_8, thus the input formula_2 and formula_3 are 1 and 1 respectively and the correct output, is 0. Now if the actual output is plotted on the horizontal axis against the error on the vertical axis, the result is a parabola. The minimum of the parabola corresponds to the output which minimizes the error . For a single training case, the minimum also touches the horizontal axis, which means the error will be zero and the network can produce an output that exactly matches the expected output . Therefore, the problem of mapping inputs to outputs can be reduced to an optimization problem of finding a function that will produce the minimal error. \n\nHowever, the output of a neuron depends on the weighted sum of all its inputs:\nwhere formula_12 and formula_13 are the weights on the connection from the input units to the output unit. Therefore, the error also depends on the incoming weights to the neuron, which is ultimately what needs to be changed in the network to enable learning. If each weight is plotted on a separate horizontal axis and the error on the vertical axis, the result is a parabolic bowl. For a neuron with weights, the same plot would require an elliptic paraboloid of formula_14 dimensions.\n\nOne commonly used algorithm to find the set of weights that minimizes the error is gradient descent.

Starting with x we search for the solution and in each iteration we need a metric to tell us whether we are closer to the solution (that is unknown to us). This metric comes from the fact that the solution is also the unique minimizer of the following quadratic function\nThe existence of a unique minimizer is apparent as its second derivative is given by a symmetric positive-definite matrix\nand that the minimizer (use D\"f\"(x)=0) solves the initial problem is obvious from its first derivative\nThis suggests taking the first basis vector p to be the negative of the gradient of \"f\" at x = x.

This can be regarded that as the algorithm progresses, p and r span the same Krylov subspace. Where r form the orthogonal basis with respect to standard inner product, and p form the orthogonal basis with respect to inner product induced by A. Therefore, x can be regarded as the projection of x on the Krylov subspace.\nThe algorithm is detailed below for solving Ax = b where A is a real, symmetric, positive-definite matrix. The input vector x can be an approximate initial solution or 0. It is a different formulation of the exact procedure described above.\nThis is the most commonly used algorithm.

Since the elimination of nondistinguishable states is computationally the most expensive one, it is usually done as the last step.\nSection::::Unreachable states.\nThe state \"p\" of a deterministic finite automaton \"M=\"(\"Q\", \u03a3, \u03b4, \"q\", \"F\") is unreachable if no string \"w\" in \u03a3 exists for which \"p=\"\u03b4(\"q\", \"w\"). In this definition, \"Q\" is the set of states, \u03a3 is the set of input symbols, \u03b4 is the transition function (mapping a state and an input symbol to a set of states), \u03b4is its extension to strings, \"q\" is the initial state, and \"F\" is the set of accepting (aka final) states. Reachable states can be obtained with the following algorithm:\nUnreachable states can be removed from the DFA without affecting the language that it accepts.\nSection::::Nondistinguishable states.\nSection::::Nondistinguishable states.:Hopcroft's algorithm.\nOne algorithm for merging the nondistinguishable states of a DFA, due to , is based on partition refinement, partitioning the DFA states into groups by their behavior. These groups represent equivalence classes of the Myhill\u2013Nerode equivalence relation, whereby every two states of the same partition are equivalent if they have the same behavior for all the input sequences. That is, for every two states and that belong to the same equivalence class within the partition , and every input word , the transitions determined by should always take states and to equal states, states that both accept, or states that both reject. It should not be possible for to take to an accepting state and to a rejecting state or vice versa.\nThe following pseudocode describes the algorithm:\nThe algorithm starts with a partition that is too coarse: every pair of states that are equivalent according to the Myhill\u2013Nerode relation belong to the same set in the partition, but pairs that are inequivalent might also belong to the same set. It gradually refines the partition into a larger number of smaller sets, at each step splitting sets of states into pairs of subsets that are necessarily inequivalent.\nThe initial partition is a separation of the states into two subsets of states that clearly do not have the same behavior as each other: the accepting states and the rejecting states. The algorithm then repeatedly chooses a set from the current partition and an input symbol , and splits each of the sets of the partition into two (possibly empty) subsets: the subset of states that lead to on input symbol , and the subset of states that do not lead to . Since is already known to have different behavior than the other sets of the partition, the subsets that lead to also have different behavior than the subsets that do not lead to . When no more splits of this type can be found, the algorithm terminates.\nLemma. Given a fixed character c and an equivalence class Y that splits into equivalence classes B and C, only one of B or C is necessary to refine the whole partition.\nExample: Suppose we have an equivalence class Y that splits into equivalence classes B and C. Suppose we also have classes D, E, and F; D and E have states with transitions into B on character c, while F has transitions into C on character c. By the Lemma, we can choose either B or C as the distinguisher, let's say B. Then the states of D and E are split by their transitions into B. But F, which doesn't point into B, simply doesn't split during the current iteration of the algorithm; it will be refined by other distinguisher(s).\nObservation. All of B or C is necessary to split referring classes like D, E, and F correctly-- subsets won't do.\nThe purpose of the outermost if statement (if Y is in W) is to patch up W, the set of distinguishers. We see in the previous statement in the algorithm that Y has just been split. If Y is in W, it has just become obsolete as a means to split classes in future iterations. So Y must be replaced by both splits because of the Observation above. If Y is not in W, however, only one of the two splits, not both, needs to be added to W because of the Lemma above. Choosing the smaller of the two splits guarantees that the new addition to W is no more than half the size of Y; this is the core of the Hopcroft algorithm: how it gets its speed, as explained in the next paragraph.\nThe worst case running time of this algorithm is , where is the number of states and is the size of the alphabet. This bound follows from the fact that, for each of the transitions of the automaton, the sets drawn from that contain the target state of the transition have sizes that decrease relative to each other by a factor of two or more, so each transition participates in of the splitting steps in the algorithm. The partition refinement data structure allows each splitting step to be performed in time proportional to the number of transitions that participate in it. This remains the most efficient algorithm known for solving the problem, and for certain distributions of inputs its average-case complexity is even better, .\nOnce Hopcroft's algorithm has been used to group the states of the input DFA into equivalence classes, the minimum DFA can be constructed by forming one state for each equivalence class. If is a set of states in , is a state in , and is an input character, then the transition in the minimum DFA from the state for , on input , goes to the set containing the state that the input automaton would go to from state on input . The initial state of the minimum DFA is the one containing the initial state of the input DFA, and the accepting states of the minimum DFA are the ones whose members are accepting states of the input DFA.\nSection::::Nondistinguishable states.:Moore's algorithm.\nMoore's algorithm for DFA minimization is due to . Like Hopcroft's algorithm, it maintains a partition that starts off separating the accepting from the rejecting states, and repeatedly refines the partition until no more refinements can be made. At each step, it replaces the current partition with the coarsest common refinement of partitions, one of which is the current one and the others are the preimages of the current partition under the transition functions for each of the input symbols. The algorithm terminates when this replacement does not change the current partition. Its worst-case time complexity is : each step of the algorithm may be performed in time using a variant of radix sort to reorder the states so that states in the same set of the new partition are consecutive in the ordering, and there are at most steps since each one but the last increases the number of sets in the partition. The instances of the DFA minimization problem that cause the worst-case behavior are the same as for Hopcroft's algorithm. The number of steps that the algorithm performs can be much smaller than , so on average (for constant ) its performance is or even depending on the random distribution on automata chosen to model the algorithm's average-case behavior.\nSection::::Nondistinguishable states.:Brzozowski's algorithm.\nAs observed, reversing the edges of a DFA produces a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) for the reversal of the original language, and converting this NFA to a DFA using the standard powerset construction (constructing only the reachable states of the converted DFA) leads to a minimal DFA for the same reversed language. Repeating this reversal operation a second time produces a minimal DFA for the original language. The worst-case complexity of Brzozowski's algorithm is exponential, as there are regular languages for which the minimal DFA of the reversal is exponentially larger than the minimal DFA of the language, but it frequently performs better than this worst case would suggest."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-34073448": 1, "wikipedia-3014865": 1, "wikipedia-4882595": 1, "wikipedia-20926": 1, "wikipedia-17447039": 1, "wikipedia-12335752": 1, "wikipedia-20036181": 1, "wikipedia-10089999": 1, "wikipedia-398786": 1, "wikipedia-563854": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-34073448": 2, "wikipedia-3014865": 1, "wikipedia-4882595": 1, "wikipedia-20926": 1, "wikipedia-17447039": 2, "wikipedia-12335752": 1, "wikipedia-20036181": 1, "wikipedia-10089999": 1, "wikipedia-398786": 1, "wikipedia-563854": 1}}}

The choice of the cost function depends on factors such as the learning type (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, etc.) and the activation function. Minimizing this cost using gradient descent for the class of neural networks called multilayer perceptrons (MLP), produces the backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks. Training a neural network model essentially means selecting one model from the set of allowed models (or, in a Bayesian framework, determining a distribution over the set of allowed models) that minimizes the cost. Numerous algorithms are available for training neural network models; most of them can be viewed as a straightforward application of optimization theory and statistical estimation. Most employ some form of gradient descent, using backpropagation to compute the actual gradients. This is done by simply taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to the network parameters and then changing those parameters in a gradient-related direction. Backpropagation training algorithms fall into three categories: BULLET::::- steepest descent (with variable learning rate and momentum, resilient backpropagation); BULLET::::- quasi-Newton (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno, one step secant); BULLET::::- Levenberg-Marquardt and conjugate gradient (Fletcher-Reeves update, Polak-Ribi\u00e8re update, Powell-Beale restart, scaled conjugate gradient). The optimization algorithm repeats a two phase cycle, propagation and weight update. When an input vector is presented to the network, it is propagated forward through the network, layer by layer, until it reaches the output layer. The output of the network is then compared to the desired output, using a loss function. The resulting error value is calculated for each of the neurons in the output layer. The error values are then propagated from the output back through the network, until each neuron has an associated error value that reflects its contribution to the original output. Backpropagation uses these error values to calculate the gradient of the loss function. In the second phase, this gradient is fed to the optimization method, which in turn uses it to update the weights, in an attempt to minimize the loss function."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The structure of the document contains a collection of these elements, and each element can in turn be a substructure of other elements.\nProblems and Constraints\nBULLET::::1. Text and graphics should be treated the same way (that is, graphics aren't a derived instance of text, nor vice versa)\nBULLET::::2. The implementation should treat complex and simple structures the same way. It should not have to know the difference between the two.\nBULLET::::3. Specific derivatives of abstract elements should have specialized analytical elements.\nSolution and Pattern\nA \"recursive composition\" is a hierarchical structure of elements, that builds \"increasingly complex elements out of simpler ones\" (pp36). Each node in the structure knows of its own children and its parent. If an operation is to be performed on the whole structure, each node calls the operation on its children (recursively).\nThis is an implementation of the composite pattern, which is a collection of nodes. The node is an abstract base class, and derivatives can either be leaves (singular), or collections of other nodes (which in turn can contain leaves or collection-nodes). When an operation is performed on the parent, that operation is recursively passed down the hierarchy.\nSection::::Case study, Chapter 2.:Formatting.\nFormatting differs from structure. Formatting is a method of constructing a particular instance of the document's physical structure. This includes breaking text into lines, using hyphens, adjusting for margin widths, etc.\nProblems and Constraints\nBULLET::::1. Balance between (formatting) quality, speed and storage space\nBULLET::::2. Keep formatting independent (uncoupled) from the document structure.\nSolution and Pattern\nA \"Compositor\" class will encapsulate the algorithm used to format a composition. Compositor is a subclass of the primitive object of the document's structure. A Compositor has an associated instance of a Composition object. When a Compositor runs its codice_1, it iterates through each element of its associated Composition, and rearranges the structure by inserting Row and Column objects as needed.\nThe Compositor itself is an abstract class, allowing for derivative classes to use different formatting algorithms (such as double-spacing, wider margins, etc.)\nThe Strategy Pattern is used to accomplish this goal. A Strategy is a method of encapsulating multiple algorithms to be used based on a changing context. In this case, formatting should be different, depending on whether text, graphics, simple elements, etc., are being formatted.\nSection::::Case study, Chapter 2.:Embellishing the User Interface.\nThe ability to change the graphical interface that the user uses to interact with the document.\nProblems and Constraints\nBULLET::::1.

In an image recognition application, the raw input may be a matrix of pixels; the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges; the third layer may encode a nose and eyes; and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level \"on its own\".

Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. Individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the receptive field. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field.\n\nEach convolutional neuron processes data only for its receptive field. Although fully connected feedforward neural networks can be used to learn features as well as classify data, it is not practical to apply this architecture to images. A very high number of neurons would be necessary, even in a shallow (opposite of deep) architecture, due to the very large input sizes associated with images, where each pixel is a relevant variable. For instance, a fully connected layer for a (small) image of size 100 x 100 has 10,000 weights for \"each\" neuron in the second layer. The convolution operation brings a solution to this problem as it reduces the number of free parameters, allowing the network to be deeper with fewer parameters.\n\nPooling layers reduce the dimensions of the data by combining the outputs of neuron clusters at one layer into a single neuron in the next layer. Local pooling combines small clusters, typically 2 x 2. Global pooling acts on all the neurons of the convolutional layer. In addition, pooling may compute a max or an average. \"Max pooling\" uses the maximum value from each of a cluster of neurons at the prior layer. \"Average pooling\" uses the average value from each of a cluster of neurons at the prior layer.\n\nThe input area of a neuron is called its \"receptive field.\" So, in a fully connected layer, the receptive field is the entire previous layer. In a convolutional layer, the receptive area is smaller than the entire previous layer.\n\nEach neuron in a neural network computes an output value by applying a specific function to the input values coming from the receptive field in the previous layer. The function that is applied to the input values is determined by a vector of weights and a bias (typically real numbers). Learning, in a neural network, progresses by making iterative adjustments to these biases and weights. The vector of weights and the bias are called \"filters\" and represent particular features of the input (e.g., a particular shape). A distinguishing feature of CNNs is that many neurons can share the same filter.\n\nWork by Hubel and Wiesel in the 1950s and 1960s showed that cat and monkey visual cortexes contain neurons that individually respond to small regions of the visual field. Provided the eyes are not moving, the region of visual space within which visual stimuli affect the firing of a single neuron is known as its receptive field. Neighboring cells have similar and overlapping receptive fields. Receptive field size and location varies systematically across the cortex to form a complete map of visual space.\n\nTheir 1968 paper identified two basic visual cell types in the brain:\n- simple cells, whose output is maximized by straight edges having particular orientations within their receptive field\n- complex cells, which have larger receptive fields, whose output is insensitive to the exact position of the edges in the field."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Verification and validation is an iterative process that takes place throughout the development of a model.\n\nSection::::Verification.\nIn the context of computer simulation, verification of a model is the process of confirming that it is correctly implemented with respect to the conceptual model (it matches specifications and assumptions deemed acceptable for the given purpose of application).\nDuring verification the model is tested to find and fix errors in the implementation of the model.\nVarious processes and techniques are used to assure the model matches specifications and assumptions with respect to the model concept. \nThe objective of model verification is to ensure that the implementation of the model is correct.\nThere are many techniques that can be utilized to verify a model.\nThese include, but are not limited to, having the model checked by an expert, making logic flow diagrams that include each logically possible action, examining the model output for reasonableness under a variety of settings of the input parameters, and using an interactive debugger.\nMany software engineering techniques used for software verification are applicable to simulation model verification.\n\nSection::::Validation.\nValidation checks the accuracy of the model's representation of the real system. Model validation is defined to mean \"substantiation that a computerized model within its domain of applicability possesses a satisfactory range of accuracy consistent with the intended application of the model\". A model should be built for a specific purpose or set of objectives and its validity determined for that purpose.\nThere are many approaches that can be used to validate a computer model. The approaches range from subjective reviews to objective statistical tests. One approach that is commonly used is to have the model builders determine validity of the model through a series of tests.\nNaylor and Finger [1967] formulated a three-step approach to model validation that has been widely followed:\nStep 1. Build a model that has high face validity.\nStep 2. Validate model assumptions.\nStep 3. Compare the model input-output transformations to corresponding input-output transformations for the real system.\n\nSection::::Validation.:Face validity.\nA model that has face validity appears to be a reasonable imitation of a real-world system to people who are knowledgeable of the real world system. Face validity is tested by having users and people knowledgeable with the system examine model output for reasonableness and in the process identify deficiencies. An added advantage of having the users involved in validation is that the model's credibility to the users and the user's confidence in the model increases. Sensitivity to model inputs can also be used to judge face validity. For example, if a simulation of a fast food restaurant drive through was run twice with customer arrival rates of 20 per hour and 40 per hour then model outputs such as average wait time or maximum number of customers waiting would be expected to increase with the arrival rate.\n\nSection::::Validation.:Validation of model assumptions.\nAssumptions made about a model generally fall into two categories: structural assumptions about how system works and data assumptions.\n\nSection::::Validation.:Validation of model assumptions.:Structural assumptions.\nAssumptions made about how the system operates and how it is physically arranged are structural assumptions. For example, the number of servers in a fast food drive through lane and if there is more than one how are they utilized? Do the servers work in parallel where a customer completes a transaction by visiting a single server or does one server take orders and handle payment while the other prepares and serves the order. Many structural problems in the model come from poor or incorrect assumptions. If possible the workings of the actual system should be closely observed to understand how it operates. The systems structure and operation should also be verified with users of the actual system.\n\nSection::::Validation.:Validation of model assumptions.:Data assumptions.\nThere must be a sufficient amount of appropriate data available to build a conceptual model and validate a model. Lack of appropriate data is often the reason attempts to validate a model fail. Data should be verified to come from a reliable source. A typical error is assuming an inappropriate statistical distribution for the data. The assumed statistical model should be tested using goodness of fit tests and other techniques. Examples of goodness of fit tests are the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test and the chi-square test. Any outliers in the data should be checked.\n\nSection::::Validation.:Validating input-output transformations.\nThe model is viewed as an input-output transformation for these tests. The validation test consists of comparing outputs from the system under consideration to model outputs for the same set of input conditions. Data recorded while observing the system must be available in order to perform this test. The model output that is of primary interest should be used as the measure of performance. For example, if system under consideration is a fast food drive through where input to model is customer arrival time and the output measure of performance is average customer time in line, then the actual arrival time and time spent in line for customers at the drive through would be recorded. The model would be run with the actual arrival times and the model average time in line would be compared with the actual average time spent in line using one or more tests.\n\nSection::::Validation.:Validating input-output transformations.:Hypothesis testing.\nStatistical hypothesis testing using the t-test can be used as a basis to accept the model as valid or reject it as invalid.\nThe hypothesis to be tested is\nversus\nThe test is conducted for a given sample size and level of significance or \u03b1. To perform the test a number \"n\" statistically independent runs of the model are conducted and an average or expected value, E(Y), for the variable of interest is produced. Then the test statistic, \"t\" is computed for the given \u03b1, \"n\", E(Y) and the observed value for the system \u03bc\nIf \nreject H, the model needs adjustment.\nThere are two types of error that can occur using hypothesis testing, rejecting a valid model called type I error or \"model builders risk\" and accepting an invalid model called Type II error, \u03b2, or \"model user's risk\". The level of significance or \u03b1 is equal the probability of type I error. If \u03b1 is small then rejecting the null hypothesis is a strong conclusion. For example, if \u03b1 = 0.05 and the null hypothesis is rejected there is only a 0.05 probability of rejecting a model that is valid. Decreasing the probability of a type II error is very important. The probability of correctly detecting an invalid model is 1 - \u03b2. The probability of a type II error is dependent of the sample size and the actual difference between the sample value and the observed value. Increasing the sample size decreases the risk of a type II error.\n\nSection::::Validation.:Validating input-output transformations.:Hypothesis testing.:Model accuracy as a range.\nA statistical technique where the amount of model accuracy is specified as a range has recently been developed. The technique uses hypothesis testing to accept a model if the difference between a model's variable of interest and a system's variable of interest is within a specified range of accuracy. A requirement is that both the system data and model data be approximately Normally Independent and Identically Distributed (NIID). The t-test statistic is used in this technique. If the mean of the model is \u03bc and the mean of system is \u03bc then the difference between the model and the system is D = \u03bc - \u03bc. The hypothesis to be tested is if D is within the acceptable range of accuracy. Let L = the lower limit for accuracy and U = upper limit for accuracy. Then\nversus\nis to be tested.\nThe operating characteristic (OC) curve is the probability that the null hypothesis is accepted when it is true. The OC curve characterizes the probabilities of both type I and II errors. Risk curves for model builder's risk and model user's can be developed from the OC curves. Comparing curves with fixed sample size tradeoffs between model builder's risk and model user's risk can be seen easily in the risk curves. If model builder's risk, model user's risk, and the upper and lower limits for the range of accuracy are all specified then the sample size needed can be calculated.\n\nSection::::Validation.:Validating input-output transformations.:Confidence intervals.\nConfidence intervals can be used to evaluate if a model is \"close enough\" to a system for some variable of interest. The difference between the known model value, \u03bc, and the system value, \u03bc, is checked to see if it is less than a value small enough that the model is valid with respect that variable of interest. The value is denoted by the symbol \u03b5. To perform the test a number, \"n\", statistically independent runs of the model are conducted and a mean or expected value, E(Y) or \u03bc for simulation output variable of interest Y, with a standard deviation \"S\" is produced. A confidence level is selected, 100(1-\u03b1). An interval, [a,b], is constructed by\nwhere \nis the critical value from the t-distribution for the given level of significance and"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-1446484": 1, "wikipedia-48191275": 1, "wikipedia-48064444": 1, "wikipedia-35889560": 1, "wikipedia-794342": 1, "wikipedia-56587689": 1, "wikipedia-46897471": 1, "wikipedia-11230690": 1, "wikipedia-35658939": 2, "wikipedia-35099585": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-1446484": 1, "wikipedia-48191275": 1, "wikipedia-48064444": 1, "wikipedia-35889560": 1, "wikipedia-794342": 1, "wikipedia-56587689": 1, "wikipedia-46897471": 1, "wikipedia-11230690": 2, "wikipedia-35658939": 3, "wikipedia-35099585": 1}}}

Now the question is: What is the probability formula_2 that an already existing node formula_3 is finally picked to connect it with the new node? Say, the node formula_3 has degree formula_7 and hence it has formula_7 neighbors. Consider that the neighbors of formula_3 are labeled formula_10 which have degrees formula_11 respectively. One can reach the node formula_3 from each of these formula_7 nodes with probabilities inverse of their respective degrees, and each of the formula_7 nodes are likely to be picked at random with probability formula_15. Thus the probability formula_2 of the MDA model is: It can be re-written as where the factor formula_19 is the inverse of the harmonic mean (IHM) of degrees of the formula_7 neighbors of the node formula_3. Extensive numerical simulation suggest that for small formula_22 the IHM value of each node fluctuate so wildly that the mean of the IHM values over the entire network bears no meaning. However, for large formula_22 (specially formula_22 approximately greater than 14) the distribution of IHM value of the entire network become left skewed Gaussian type and mean starts to have a meaning which becomes a constant value in the large formula_22 limit. In this limit one finds that formula_26 which is exactly the PA rule. It implies that the higher the links (degree) a node has, the higher its chance of gaining more links since they can be reached in a larger number of ways through mediators which essentially embodies the intuitive idea of rich get richer mechanism.

They are non-adapting, meaning that even when there is no change in muscle length, they keep responding to stimuli. In the body, Type II fibers are the second most highly myelinated fibers. Type II sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and their somas reside in ganglia, like the dorsal root ganglia or the nodose ganglion.\nThe muscle's instantaneous length, or position, is directly proportional to their firing rate. This information would indicate the position of one's leg once it has stopped moving. They do not respond to rate of length changes as do the Ia fibers.\nType II fibers connect to nuclear chain fibers and static nuclear bag fibers in muscle spindles, but not to dynamic nuclear bag fibers. The typical innervation to muscle spindles consists of one type I fiber and 2 type II fibers. The type Ia fiber has \"anulospiral\" endings around the middle parts of the intrafusal fibers compared to type II fibers that have \"flower spray\" endings which may be spray shaped or anular, spreading in narrow bands on both sides of the type Ia endings. It is thought that the relative position of the equatorial regions of the spray when stretched determines the action potential output.\nType II fibers assist in the transmission of somatosensory information as well as nociceptive information. In normal physiological conditions they transmit tactile touch, the responses of different type II fibers to these stimuli can be subdivided based on their adaptation properties, traditionally into rapidly adapting (RA) or slowly adapting (SA) neurons. Type II RA neurone endings can take the form of Meissner's corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles, or Lanceolate Endings, whereas type II SA neurone endings are Merkel cell-neurite complexes or Ruffini endings. Under pathological conditions they may become hyper-excitable leading to stimuli that would usually elicit sensations of tactile touch causing pain.

The practice of total war which had been in use for over a century, as a form of war policy, has been changed dramatically with greater awareness of tactical, operational, and strategic battle information.\nWith the invention of nuclear weapons, the concept of full-scale war carries the prospect of global annihilation, and as such conflicts since WWII have by definition been \"low intensity\" conflicts, typically in the form of proxy wars fought within local regional confines, using what are now referred to as \"conventional weapons,\" typically combined with the use of asymmetric warfare tactics and applied use of intelligence.\nMore recently, the US Department of Defense introduced a concept of battlespace as the integrated information management of all significant factors that impact on combat operations by armed forces for the military theatre of operations, including information, air, land, sea, and space. It includes the environment, factors, and conditions that must be understood to successfully apply combat power, protect the force, or complete the mission.

Aerial warfare includes bombers attacking enemy concentrations or strategic targets; fighter aircraft battling for control of airspace; attack aircraft engaging in close air support against ground targets; naval aviation flying against sea and nearby land targets; gliders, helicopters and other aircraft to carry airborne forces such as paratroopers; aerial refueling tankers to extend operation time or range; and military transport aircraft to move cargo and personnel.\n\nSection::::Types.:Asymmetric.\nA military situation in which two belligerents of unequal strength interact and take advantage of their respective strengths and weaknesses. This interaction often involves strategies and tactics outside conventional warfare.\n\nSection::::Types.:Biological.\nBiological warfare, also known as germ warfare, is the use of any organism (bacteria, virus or other disease-causing organism) or toxin found in nature, as a weapon of war. It is meant to incapacitate or kill enemy combatants. It may also be defined as the employment of biological agents to produce casualties in man or animals and damage to plants or material; or defense against such employment.\n\nSection::::Types.:Chemical.\nChemical warfare is warfare (associated military operations) using the toxic properties of chemical substances to incapacitate or kill enemy combatants.\n\nSection::::Types.:Electronic.\nElectronic warfare refers to mainly non-violent practices used chiefly to support other areas of warfare. The term was originally coined to encompass the interception and decoding of enemy radio communications, and the communications technologies and cryptography methods used to counter such interception, as well as jamming, radio stealth, and other related areas. Over the later years of the 20th century and early years of the 21st century, this has expanded to cover a wide range of areas: the use of, detection of and avoidance of detection by radar and sonar systems, computer hacking, etc.\n\nSection::::Types.:Fourth generation.\nFourth generation warfare (4GW) is a concept defined by William S. Lind and expanded by Thomas X. Hammes, used to describe the decentralized nature of modern warfare. The simplest definition includes any war in which one of the major participants is not a state but rather a violent ideological network. Fourth Generation wars are characterized by a blurring of the lines between war and politics, combatants and civilians, conflicts and peace, battlefields and safety.\nWhile this term is similar to terrorism and asymmetric warfare, it is much narrower. Classical insurgencies and the Indian Wars are examples of pre-modern wars, not 4GW. Fourth generation warfare usually has the insurgency group or non-state side trying to implement their own government or reestablish an old government over the one currently running the territory. The blurring of lines between state and non-state is further complicated in a democracy by the power of the media.\n\nSection::::Types.:Ground.\nGround warfare involves three types of combat units: Infantry, Armor, and Artillery.\nInfantry in modern times would consist of Mechanized infantry and Airborne forces. Usually having a type of rifle or sub-machine gun, the Smg usually used from close range. There are three types of rifles, assault rifles sniper rifles and regular rifles. An infantryman is the basic unit of an army.\nArmored warfare in modern times involves a variety of Armored fighting vehicles for the purpose of battle and support. Tanks or other armored vehicles (such as armored personnel carriers or tank destroyers) are slower, yet stronger hunks of metal. They are invulnerable to enemy machine gun fire but prone to rocket infantry, mines, and aircraft so are usually accompanied by infantry. In urban areas, because of smaller space, an armored vehicle is exposed to hidden enemy infantry but as the so-called \"Thunder Run\" at Baghdad in 2003 showed, armored vehicles can play a critical role in urban combat. In rural areas, an armored vehicle does not have to worry about hidden units though muddy and damp terrain have always been a factor of weakness for Armored tanks and vehicles.\nArtillery in contemporary times, is distinguished by its large calibre, firing an explosive shell or rocket, and being of such a size and weight as to require a specialized mount for firing and transport. Weapons covered by this term include \"tube\" artillery such as the howitzer, cannon, mortar, field gun, and rocket artillery. The term \"artillery\" has traditionally not been used for projectiles with internal guidance systems, even though some artillery units employ surface-to-surface missiles. Recent advances in terminal guidance systems for small munitions has allowed large calibre shells to be fitted with precision guidance fuses, blurring this distinction.\n\nSection::::Types.:Guerrilla.\nGuerrilla warfare is defined as fighting by groups of irregular troops (guerrillas) within areas occupied by the enemy. When guerrillas obey the laws and customs of war, they are entitled, if captured, to be treated as ordinary prisoners of war; however, they are often treated by their captors as unlawful combatants and executed. The tactics of guerrilla warfare stress deception and ambush, as opposed to mass confrontation, and succeed best in an irregular, rugged, terrain and with a sympathetic populace, whom guerrillas often seek to win over or dominate by propaganda, reform, and terrorism. Guerrilla warfare has played a significant role in modern history, especially when waged by Communist liberation movements in Southeast Asia (most notably in the Vietnam War) and elsewhere.\nGuerrilla fighters gravitate toward weapons which are easily accessible, low in technology, and low in cost. A typical arsenal of the modern guerrilla would include the AK-47, RPGs and Improvised explosive devices. The guerrilla doctrines' main disadvantage is the inability to access more advanced equipment due to economic, influence, and accessibility issues. They must rely on small unit tactics involving hit and run. This situation leads to low intensity warfare, asymmetrical warfare, and war amongst the people. The rules of Guerrilla warfare are to fight a little and then to retreat.\n\nSection::::Types.:Intelligence.\nPropaganda\nPropaganda is an ancient form of disinformation concerted with sending a set of messages aimed at influencing the opinions or behavior of large numbers of people. Instead of impartially providing information, propaganda in its most basic sense presents information in order to influence its audience. The most effective propaganda is often completely truthful, but usually most modern propaganda presents facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis, or gives loaded messages in order to produce an emotional rather than rational response to the information presented. The desired result is a change of the cognitive narrative of the subject in the target audience.\nPsychological\nPsychological warfare had its beginnings during the campaigns of Genghis Khan through the allowance of certain civilians of the nations, cities, and villages to flee said place, spreading terror and fear to neighboring principalities. Psychological actions have the primary purpose of influencing the opinions, emotions, attitudes, and behavior of hostile foreign groups in such a way as to support the achievement of national objectives.\nInformation\nMade possible by the widespread use of the electronic media during World War II, Information warfare is a kind of warfare where information and attacks on information and its system are used as a tool of warfare.

Wikipedia may not explicitly address this perception, but it offers foundational knowledge to understand the concept.", "wikipedia-32472154": ["Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that use multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify human-meaningful items such as digits or letters or faces.\n\nIn deep learning, each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation. In an image recognition application, the raw input may be a matrix of pixels; the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges; the third layer may encode a nose and eyes; and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level \"on its own\". (Of course, this does not completely obviate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.)\n\nThe \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial \"credit assignment path\" (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. No universally agreed upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth  2. CAP of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. Beyond that more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP  2) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning features."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-41416740": 1, "wikipedia-392874": 1, "wikipedia-14012114": 1, "wikipedia-3791086": 1, "wikipedia-32472154": 3, "wikipedia-39182554": 1, "wikipedia-55867424": 1, "wikipedia-42502861": 1, "wikipedia-1164": 1, "wikipedia-21523": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-41416740": 1, "wikipedia-392874": 1, "wikipedia-14012114": 1, "wikipedia-3791086": 1, "wikipedia-32472154": 3, "wikipedia-39182554": 1, "wikipedia-55867424": 1, "wikipedia-42502861": 1, "wikipedia-1164": 1, "wikipedia-21523": 1}}}

Image textures are one way that can be used to help in segmentation or classification of images. For more accurate segmentation the most useful features are spatial frequency and an average grey level. To analyze an image texture in computer graphics, there are two ways to approach the issue: Structured Approach and Statistical Approach.\nSection::::Structured Approach.\nA structured approach sees an image texture as a set of primitive texels in some regular or repeated pattern. This works well when analyzing artificial textures.\nTo obtain a structured description a characterization of the spatial relationship of the texels is gathered by using Voronoi tessellation of the texels.\nSection::::Statistical Approach.\nA statistical approach sees an image texture as a quantitative measure of the arrangement of intensities in a region.

Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form. Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.\n\nBuildings, aircraft, skeletons, anthills, beaver dams and salt domes are all examples of load-bearing structures. The results of construction are divided into buildings and non-building structures, and make up the infrastructure of a human society. Built structures are broadly divided by their varying design approaches and standards, into categories including building structures, architectural structures, civil engineering structures and mechanical structures.\n\nIn biology, structures exist at all levels of organization, ranging hierarchically from the atomic and molecular to the cellular, tissue, organ, organismic, population and ecosystem level. Usually, a higher-level structure is composed of multiple copies of a lower-level structure.\n\nChemical structure refers to both molecular geometry and electronic structure. The structure can be represented by a variety of diagrams called structural formulas. Lewis structures use a dot notation to represent the valence electrons for an atom; these are the electrons that determine the role of the atom in chemical reactions. Bonds between atoms can be represented by lines with one line for each pair of electrons that is shared. In a simplified version of such a diagram, called a skeletal formula, only carbon-carbon bonds and functional groups are shown.\n\nA large part of numerical analysis involves identifying and interpreting the structure of musical works. Structure can be found at the level of part of a work, the entire work, or a group of works. Elements of music such as pitch, duration and timbre combine into small elements like motifs and phrases, and these in turn combine in larger structures. Not all music (for example, that of John Cage) has a hierarchical organization, but hierarchy makes it easier for a listener to understand and remember the music.\n\nA social structure is a pattern of relationships. They are social organizations of individuals in various life situations. Structures are applicable to people in how a society is as a system organized by a characteristic pattern of relationships. This is known as the social organization of the group. Sociologists have studied the changing structure of these groups. Structure and agency are two confronted theories about human behaviour. The debate surrounding the influence of structure and agency on human thought is one of the central issues in sociology. In this context, \"agency\" refers to the individual human capacity to act independently and make free choices. \"Structure\" here refers to factors such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, customs, etc. that seem to limit or influence individual opportunities.\n\nIn computer science, a data structure is a way of organizing information in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Data structures are built out of two basic types: An array has an index that can be used for immediate access to any data item, but depending on the programming language used, its size must be specified when it is initialized. A linked list can be reorganized, grown or shrunk, but its elements must be accessed with a pointer that links them together in a particular order. Out of these any number of other data structures can be created such as stacks, queues, trees and hash tables."], "wikipedia-5386671": ["Structure from motion (SfM) is a photogrammetric range imaging technique for estimating three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional image sequences that may be coupled with local motion signals.

The connections between artificial neurons are called 'edges'. Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times."], "wikipedia-20382637": ["BULLET::::- Artificial neural network, a computing system inspired by the biological neural networks found in animal brains\nBULLET::::- Biological neural network or neural circuit, a collection of physically interconnected neurons that carry out a specific function together"], "wikipedia-10159567": ["Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks that more closely mimic natural neural networks.

A closely related and very common aspect of connectionist models is \"activation\". At any time, a unit in the network has an activation, which is a numerical value intended to represent some aspect of the unit. For example, if the units in the model are neurons, the activation could represent the probability that the neuron would generate an action potential spike. Activation typically spreads to all the other units connected to it. Spreading activation is always a feature of neural network models, and it is very common in connectionist models used by cognitive psychologists.\n\nNeural networks are by far the most commonly used connectionist model today.

Many recurrent connectionist models also incorporate dynamical systems theory. Many researchers, such as the connectionist Paul Smolensky, have argued that connectionist models will evolve toward fully continuous, high-dimensional, non-linear, dynamic systems approaches.\n\nThe weights in a neural network are adjusted according to some learning rule or algorithm, such as Hebbian learning. Thus, connectionists have created many sophisticated learning procedures for neural networks. Learning always involves modifying the connection weights. In general, these involve mathematical formulas to determine the change in weights when given sets of data consisting of activation vectors for some subset of the neural units. Several studies have been focused on designing teaching-learning methods based on connectionism.\nBy formalizing learning in such a way, connectionists have many tools. A very common strategy in connectionist learning methods is to incorporate gradient descent over an error surface in a space defined by the weight matrix. All gradient descent learning in connectionist models involves changing each weight by the partial derivative of the error surface with respect to the weight.

In fact, ties are often associated with weights that differentiate them in terms of their strength, intensity, or capacity (Barrat et al., 2004) and Horvath (2011). On the one hand, Mark Granovetter (1973) argued that the strength of social relationships in social networks is a function of their duration, emotional intensity, intimacy, and exchange of services.

An HTM layer creates a sparse distributed representation from its input, so that a fixed percentage of \"minicolumns\" are active at any one time.

The hidden layers of a CNN typically consist of a series of convolutional layers that \"convolve\" with a multiplication or other dot product. The activation function is commonly a RELU layer, and is subsequently followed by additional convolutions such as pooling layers, fully connected layers and normalization layers, referred to as hidden layers because their inputs and outputs are masked by the activation function and final convolution. The final convolution, in turn, often involves backpropagation in order to more accurately weight the end product.\n\nEach convolutional neuron processes data only for its receptive field. Although fully connected feedforward neural networks can be used to learn features as well as classify data, it is not practical to apply this architecture to images. A very high number of neurons would be necessary, even in a shallow (opposite of deep) architecture, due to the very large input sizes associated with images, where each pixel is a relevant variable. For instance, a fully connected layer for a (small) image of size 100 x 100 has 10,000 weights for \"each\" neuron in the second layer. The convolution operation brings a solution to this problem as it reduces the number of free parameters, allowing the network to be deeper with fewer parameters. For instance, regardless of image size, tiling regions of size 5 x 5, each with the same shared weights, requires only 25 learnable parameters. In this way, it resolves the vanishing or exploding gradients problem in training traditional multi-layer neural networks with many layers by using backpropagation.\n\nFully connected layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in another layer. It is in principle the same as the traditional multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP). The flattened matrix goes through a fully connected layer to classify the images.\n\nIn neural networks, each neuron receives input from some number of locations in the previous layer. In a fully connected layer, each neuron receives input from \"every\" element of the previous layer. In a convolutional layer, neurons receive input from only a restricted subarea of the previous layer. Typically the subarea is of a square shape (e.g., size 5 by 5). The input area of a neuron is called its \"receptive field\". So, in a fully connected layer, the receptive field is the entire previous layer. In a convolutional layer, the receptive area is smaller than the entire previous layer.\n\nEach neuron in a neural network computes an output value by applying a specific function to the input values coming from the receptive field in the previous layer.

Multilayer perceptrons usually refer to fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The \"fully-connectedness\" of these networks makes them prone to overfitting data. Typical ways of regularization include adding some form of magnitude measurement of weights to the loss function. However, CNNs take a different approach towards regularization: they take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble more complex patterns using smaller and simpler patterns. Therefore, on the scale of connectedness and complexity, CNNs are on the lower extreme.\n\nEach convolutional neuron processes data only for its receptive field. Although fully connected feedforward neural networks can be used to learn features as well as classify data, it is not practical to apply this architecture to images. A very high number of neurons would be necessary, even in a shallow (opposite of deep) architecture, due to the very large input sizes associated with images, where each pixel is a relevant variable. For instance, a fully connected layer for a (small) image of size 100 x 100 has 10,000 weights for \"each\" neuron in the second layer. The convolution operation brings a solution to this problem as it reduces the number of free parameters, allowing the network to be deeper with fewer parameters. For instance, regardless of image size, tiling regions of size 5 x 5, each with the same shared weights, requires only 25 learnable parameters. In this way, it resolves the vanishing or exploding gradients problem in training traditional multi-layer neural networks with many layers by using backpropagation.\n\nIn neural networks, each neuron receives input from some number of locations in the previous layer.

The typical process for using genetic algorithms to refine a gene regulatory network is: first, create a population; next, to create offspring via a crossover operation and evaluate their fitness; then, on a group chosen for high fitness, simulate mutation via a mutation operator; finally, taking the now mutated group, repeat this process until a desired level of fitness is demonstrated."], "wikipedia-1360091": ["Backpropagation algorithms are a family of methods used to efficiently train artificial neural networks (ANNs) following a gradient descent approach that exploits the chain rule. The main feature of backpropagation is its iterative, recursive and efficient method for calculating the weights updates to improve the network until it is able to perform the task for which it is being trained. It is closely related to the Gauss\u2013Newton algorithm.\nBackpropagation requires the derivatives of activation functions to be known at network design time. Automatic differentiation is a technique that can automatically and analytically provide the derivatives to the training algorithm. In the context of learning, backpropagation is commonly used by the gradient descent optimization algorithm to adjust the weight of neurons by calculating the gradient of the loss function; backpropagation computes the gradient(s), whereas (stochastic) gradient descent uses the gradients for training the model (via optimization).\n\nOne commonly used algorithm to find the set of weights that minimizes the error is gradient descent. Backpropagation is then used to calculate the steepest descent direction in an efficient way.\n\nThe gradient descent method involves calculating the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network. This is normally done using backpropagation. Assuming one output neuron, the squared error function is\n\nwhere\n\nFor each neuron formula_21, its output formula_22 is defined as\n\nWhere the activation function formula_24 is non-linear and differentiable (even if the ReLU is not in one point). A historically used activation function is the logistic function:\n\nwhich has a convenient derivative of:\n\nThe input formula_27 to a neuron is the weighted sum of outputs formula_28 of previous neurons. If the neuron is in the first layer after the input layer, the formula_28 of the input layer are simply the inputs formula_30 to the network. The number of input units to the neuron is formula_31. The variable formula_32 denotes the weight between neuron formula_33 of the previous layer and neuron formula_21 of the current layer.\n\nCalculating the partial derivative of the error with respect to a weight formula_35 is done using the chain rule twice:\n\nIn the last factor of the right-hand side of the above, only one term in the sum formula_27 depends on formula_35, so that\n\nIf the neuron is in the first layer after the input layer, formula_38 is just formula_39.\n\nThe derivative of the output of neuron formula_21 with respect to its input is simply the partial derivative of the activation function:\n\nThis is the reason why backpropagation requires the activation function to be differentiable. (Nevertheless, the ReLU activation function, which is non-differentiable at 0, has become quite popular, e.g. in AlexNet)\n\nThe first factor is straightforward to evaluate if the neuron is in the output layer, because then formula_42 and\n\nIf the logistic function is used as activation and square error as loss function we can rewrite it as\n\nformula_43\n\nHowever, if formula_21 is in an arbitrary inner layer of the network, finding the derivative formula_16 with respect to formula_22 is less obvious.\n\nConsidering formula_16 as a function with the inputs being all neurons formula_48 receiving input from neuron formula_21,\n\nand taking the total derivative with respect to formula_22, a recursive expression for the derivative is obtained:\n\nTherefore, the derivative with respect to formula_22 can be calculated if all the derivatives with respect to the outputs formula_53 of the next layer \u2013 the ones closer to the output neuron \u2013 are known.\n\nSubstituting , and in we obtain:\n\nwith\n\nif formula_24 is the logistic function, and the error is the square error:\n\nTo update the weight formula_35 using gradient descent, one must choose a learning rate, formula_60. The change in weight needs to reflect the impact on formula_16 of an increase or decrease in formula_35. If formula_63, an increase in formula_35 increases formula_16; conversely, if formula_66, an increase in formula_35 decreases formula_16. The new formula_69 is added to the old weight, and the product of the learning rate and the gradient, multiplied by formula_70 guarantees that formula_35 changes in a way that always decreases formula_16. In other words, in the equation immediately below, formula_73 always changes formula_35 in such a way that formula_16 is decreased:"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-14405160": 1, "wikipedia-35699507": 1, "wikipedia-21523": 2, "wikipedia-28016652": 2, "wikipedia-173926": 1, "wikipedia-24373430": 1, "wikipedia-8402086": 1, "wikipedia-1360091": 2, "wikipedia-233488": 1, "wikipedia-40678189": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-14405160": 2, "wikipedia-35699507": 1, "wikipedia-21523": 3, "wikipedia-28016652": 3, "wikipedia-173926": 1, "wikipedia-24373430": 1, "wikipedia-8402086": 2, "wikipedia-1360091": 3, "wikipedia-233488": 1, "wikipedia-40678189": 1}}}

Its network creates a directed connection between every pair of units. Each has a time-varying, real-valued (more than just zero or one) activation (output). Each connection has a modifiable real-valued weight. Some of the nodes are called labeled nodes, some output nodes, the rest hidden nodes.\nFor supervised learning in discrete time settings, training sequences of real-valued input vectors become sequences of activations of the input nodes, one input vector at a time. At each time step, each non-input unit computes its current activation as a nonlinear function of the weighted sum of the activations of all units from which it receives connections. The system can explicitly activate (independent of incoming signals) some output units at certain time steps. For example, if the input sequence is a speech signal corresponding to a spoken digit, the final target output at the end of the sequence may be a label classifying the digit. For each sequence, its error is the sum of the deviations of all activations computed by the network from the corresponding target signals. For a training set of numerous sequences, the total error is the sum of the errors of all individual sequences.\nTo minimize total error, gradient descent can be used to change each weight in proportion to its derivative with respect to the error, provided the non-linear activation functions are differentiable. The standard method is called \"backpropagation through time\" or BPTT, a generalization of back-propagation for feedforward networks. A more computationally expensive online variant is called \"Real-Time Recurrent Learning\" or RTRL. Unlike BPTT this algorithm is \"local in time but not local in space\". An online hybrid between BPTT and RTRL with intermediate complexity exists, with variants for continuous time. A major problem with gradient descent for standard RNN architectures is that error gradients vanish exponentially quickly with the size of the time lag between important events. The Long short-term memory architecture overcomes these problems.\nIn reinforcement learning settings, no teacher provides target signals. Instead a fitness function or reward function or utility function is occasionally used to evaluate performance, which influences its input stream through output units connected to actuators that affect the environment. Variants of evolutionary computation are often used to optimize the weight matrix."], "wikipedia-35699507": ["An artificial neural network's learning rule or learning process is a method, mathematical logic or algorithm which improves the network's performance and/or training time. Usually, this rule is applied repeatedly over the network. It is done by updating the levels of a network when a network is simulated in a specific data environment. A learning rule may accept existing conditions (weights and biases) of the network and will compare the expected result and actual result of the network to give new and improved values for weights and bias. Depending on the complexity of actual model being simulated, the learning rule of the network can be as simple as an XOR gate or mean squared error, or as complex as the result of a system of differential equations."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-1514392": 1, "wikipedia-470314": 1, "wikipedia-10159567": 1, "wikipedia-27569062": 1, "wikipedia-2593441": 1, "wikipedia-271430": 1, "wikipedia-21523": 3, "wikipedia-28016652": 3, "wikipedia-35699507": 3, "wikipedia-50073184": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-1514392": 2, "wikipedia-470314": 1, "wikipedia-10159567": 1, "wikipedia-27569062": 1, "wikipedia-2593441": 1, "wikipedia-271430": 1, "wikipedia-21523": 3, "wikipedia-28016652": 3, "wikipedia-35699507": 3, "wikipedia-50073184": 1}}}

The typical process for using genetic algorithms to refine a gene regulatory network is: first, create a population; next, to create offspring via a crossover operation and evaluate their fitness; then, on a group chosen for high fitness, simulate mutation via a mutation operator; finally, taking the now mutated group, repeat this process until a desired level of fitness is demonstrated.\n\nMethods by which artificial neural networks may alter their structure without simulated mutation and fitness selection have been developed. A dynamically evolving neural network is one approach, as the creation of new connections and new neurons can be modeled as the system adapts to new data. This enables the network to evolve in modeling accuracy without simulated natural selection. One method by which dynamically evolving networks may be optimized, called evolving layer neuron aggregation, combines neurons with sufficiently similar input weights into one neuron. This can take place during the training of the network, referred to as online aggregation, or between periods of training, referred to as offline aggregation. Experiments have suggested that offline aggregation is more efficient."], "wikipedia-52003586": ["Shibata began working with this framework in 1997. They employed Q-learning and actor-critic for continuous motion tasks, and used a recurrent neural network for memory-required tasks.

They used a deep convolutional neural network that showed superior results in image recognition. They used 4 frames of almost raw RGB pixels (84x84) as inputs. The network was trained based on RL with the reward representing the sign of the change in the game score. All 49 games were learned using the same network architecture and Q-learning with minimal prior knowledge, and outperformed competing methods on almost all the games and performed at a level that is comparable or superior to a professional human game tester.

There are two core components in this HTM theory: a spatial pooling algorithm, which outputs sparse distributed representations (SDR), and a sequence memory algorithm, which learns to represent and predict complex sequences."], "wikipedia-1706303": ["Gradient descent is a iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. In neural networks, it can be used to minimize the error term by changing each weight in proportion to the derivative of the error with respect to that weight, provided the non-linear activation functions are differentiable. Various methods for doing so were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s by Werbos, Williams, Robinson, Schmidhuber, Hochreiter, Pearlmutter and others.\nThe standard method is called \"backpropagation through time\" or BPTT, and is a generalization of back-propagation for feed-forward networks. Like that method, it is an instance of automatic differentiation in the reverse accumulation mode of Pontryagin's minimum principle. A more computationally expensive online variant is called \"Real-Time Recurrent Learning\" or RTRL, which is an instance of automatic differentiation in the forward accumulation mode with stacked tangent vectors. Unlike BPTT, this algorithm is local in time but not local in space.\nIn this context, local in space means that a unit's weight vector can be updated using only information stored in the connected units and the unit itself such that update complexity of a single unit is linear in the dimensionality of the weight vector. Local in time means that the updates take place continually (on-line) and depend only on the most recent time step rather than on multiple time steps within a given time horizon as in BPTT. Biological neural networks appear to be local with respect to both time and space.\nFor recursively computing the partial derivatives, RTRL has a time-complexity of O(number of hidden x number of weights) per time step for computing the Jacobian matrices, while BPTT only takes O(number of weights) per time step, at the cost of storing all forward activations within the given time horizon. An online hybrid between BPTT and RTRL with intermediate complexity exists, along with variants for continuous time.\nA major problem with gradient descent for standard RNN architectures is that error gradients vanish exponentially quickly with the size of the time lag between important events. LSTM combined with a BPTT/RTRL hybrid learning method attempts to overcome these problems. This problem is also solved in the independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN) by reducing the context of a neuron to its own past state and the cross-neuron information can then be explored in the following layers. Memories of different range including long-term memory can be learned without the gradient vanishing and exploding problem."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The locality of the optimum is dependent on the neighborhood structure as defined by the local search method that is used for optimizing the function.

Because of the complexity of the optimization algorithms, almost all adaptive filters are digital filters. The closed loop adaptive filter uses feedback in the form of an error signal to refine its transfer function.\nGenerally speaking, the closed loop adaptive process involves the use of a cost function, which is a criterion for optimum performance of the filter, to feed an algorithm, which determines how to modify filter transfer function to minimize the cost on the next iteration. The most common cost function is the mean square of the error signal.\nThe idea behind a closed loop adaptive filter is that a variable filter is adjusted until the error (the difference between the filter output and the desired signal) is minimized. The Least Mean Squares (LMS) filter and the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) filter are types of adaptive filter.\nIf the variable filter has a tapped delay line FIR structure, then the LMS update algorithm is especially simple. Typically, after each sample, the coefficients of the FIR filter are adjusted as follows:(Widrow)\nThe LMS algorithm does not require that the X values have any particular relationship; therefore it can be used to adapt a linear combiner as well as an FIR filter. In this case the update formula is written as:\nThe effect of the LMS algorithm is at each time, k, to make a small change in each weight. The direction of the change is such that it would decrease the error if it had been applied at time k. The magnitude of the change in each weight depends on \u03bc, the associated X value and the error at time k. The weights making the largest contribution to the output, formula_9, are changed the most. If the error is zero, then there should be no change in the weights. If the associated value of X is zero, then changing the weight makes no difference, so it is not changed.\n\u03bc controls how fast and how well the algorithm converges to the optimum filter coefficients. If \u03bc is too large, the algorithm will not converge. If \u03bc is too small the algorithm converges slowly and may not be able to track changing conditions. If \u03bc is large but not too large to prevent convergence, the algorithm reaches steady state rapidly but continuously overshoots the optimum weight vector. Sometimes, \u03bc is made large at first for rapid convergence and then decreased to minimize overshoot."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

The rule is unstable, however, and is typically modified using such variations as Oja's rule, radial basis functions or the backpropagation algorithm.\n\nFor biological networks, the effect of synaptic weights is not as simple as for linear neurons or Hebbian learning. However, biophysical models such as BCM theory have seen some success in mathematically describing these networks.\n\nIn the mammalian central nervous system, signal transmission is carried out by interconnected networks of nerve cells, or neurons. For the basic pyramidal neuron, the input signal is carried by the axon, which releases neurotransmitter chemicals into the synapse which is picked up by the dendrites of the next neuron, which can then generate an action potential which is analogous to the output signal in the computational case.\n\nThe synaptic weight in this process is determined by several variable factors:\nBULLET::::- How well the input signal propagates through the axon (see myelination),\nBULLET::::- The amount of neurotransmitter released into the synapse and the amount that can be absorbed in the following cell (determined by the number of AMPA and NMDA receptors on the cell membrane and the amount of intracellular calcium and other ions),\nBULLET::::- The number of such connections made by the axon to the dendrites,\nBULLET::::- How well the signal propagates and integrates in the postsynaptic cell.\n\nThe changes in synaptic weight that occur is known as synaptic plasticity, and the process behind long-term changes (long-term potentiation and depression) is still poorly understood.

A network is a system whose elements are somehow connected (Wasserman and Faust, 1994). The elements of a system are represented as nodes (also known as actors or vertices) and the connections among interacting elements are known as ties, edges, arcs, or links. The nodes might be neurons, individuals, groups, organisations, airports, or even countries, whereas ties can take the form of friendship, communication, collaboration, alliance, flow, or trade, to name a few.\nIn a number of real-world networks, not all ties in a network have the same capacity. In fact, ties are often associated with weights that differentiate them in terms of their strength, intensity, or capacity (Barrat et al., 2004) and Horvath (2011). On the one hand, Mark Granovetter (1973) argued that the strength of social relationships in social networks is a function of their duration, emotional intensity, intimacy, and exchange of services. On the other, for non-social networks, weights often refer to the function performed by ties, e.g., the carbon flow (mg/m\u00b2/day) between species in food webs (Luczkowich et al., 2003), the number of synapses and gap junctions in neural networks (Watts and Strogatz, 1998), or the amount of traffic flowing along connections in transportation networks (Opsahl et al., 2008).\nBy recording the strength of ties, a weighted network can be created (also known as a valued network).

In the context of learning, backpropagation is commonly used by the gradient descent optimization algorithm to adjust the weight of neurons by calculating the gradient of the loss function; backpropagation computes the gradient(s), whereas (stochastic) gradient descent uses the gradients for training the model (via optimization).\n\nThe goal of any supervised learning algorithm is to find a function that best maps a set of inputs to their correct output. The motivation for backpropagation is to train a multi-layered neural network such that it can learn the appropriate internal representations to allow it to learn any arbitrary mapping of input to output.\n\nTo understand the mathematical derivation of the backpropagation algorithm, it helps to first develop some intuition about the relationship between the actual output of a neuron and the correct output for a particular training example. Consider a simple neural network with two input units, one output unit and no hidden units, and in which each neuron uses a linear output (unlike most work on neural networks, in which mapping from inputs to outputs is non-linear) that is the weighted sum of its input. \nInitially, before training, the weights will be set randomly. Then the neuron learns from training examples, which in this case consist of a set of tuples formula_1 where formula_2 and formula_3 are the inputs to the network and is the correct output (the output the network should produce given those inputs, when it has been trained). The initial network, given formula_2 and formula_3, will compute an output that likely differs from (given random weights). A loss function formula_6 is used for measuring the discrepancy between the expected output and the actual output . For regression analysis problems the squared error can be used as a loss function, for classification the categorical crossentropy can be used.\nAs an example consider a regression problem using the square error as a loss:\nwhere is the discrepancy or error.\nConsider the network on a single training case: formula_8, thus the input formula_2 and formula_3 are 1 and 1 respectively and the correct output, is 0. Now if the actual output is plotted on the horizontal axis against the error on the vertical axis, the result is a parabola. The minimum of the parabola corresponds to the output which minimizes the error . For a single training case, the minimum also touches the horizontal axis, which means the error will be zero and the network can produce an output that exactly matches the expected output . Therefore, the problem of mapping inputs to outputs can be reduced to an optimization problem of finding a function that will produce the minimal error. \nHowever, the output of a neuron depends on the weighted sum of all its inputs:\nwhere formula_12 and formula_13 are the weights on the connection from the input units to the output unit. Therefore, the error also depends on the incoming weights to the neuron, which is ultimately what needs to be changed in the network to enable learning. If each weight is plotted on a separate horizontal axis and the error on the vertical axis, the result is a parabolic bowl. For a neuron with weights, the same plot would require an elliptic paraboloid of formula_14 dimensions.\nOne commonly used algorithm to find the set of weights that minimizes the error is gradient descent. Backpropagation is then used to calculate the steepest descent direction in an efficient way."], "wikipedia-21523": ["A key trigger for renewed interest in neural networks and learning was Werbos's (1975) backpropagation algorithm that made the training of multi-layer networks feasible and efficient.

Learning algorithms search through the solution space to find a function that has the smallest possible cost.\nFor applications where the solution is data dependent, the cost must necessarily be a function of the observations, otherwise the model would not relate to the data. It is frequently defined as a statistic to which only approximations can be made. As a simple example, consider the problem of finding the model formula_36, which minimizes formula_56, for data pairs formula_57 drawn from some distribution formula_58. In practical situations we would only have formula_59 samples from formula_58 and thus, for the above example, we would only minimize formula_61. Thus, the cost is minimized over a sample of the data rather than the entire distribution.\nWhen formula_62 some form of online machine learning must be used, where the cost is reduced as each new example is seen. While online machine learning is often used when formula_58 is fixed, it is most useful in the case where the distribution changes slowly over time. In neural network methods, some form of online machine learning is frequently used for finite datasets.\nA DNN can be discriminatively trained with the standard backpropagation algorithm.

The choice of the cost function depends on factors such as the learning type (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, etc.) and the activation function. For example, when performing supervised learning on a multiclass classification problem, common choices for the activation function and cost function are the softmax function and cross entropy function, respectively. The softmax function is defined as formula_68 where formula_69 represents the class probability (output of the unit formula_70) and formula_71 and formula_72 represent the total input to units formula_70 and formula_74 of the same level respectively. Cross entropy is defined as formula_75 where formula_76 represents the target probability for output unit formula_70 and formula_69 is the probability output for formula_70 after applying the activation function.\n\nA commonly used cost is the mean-squared error, which tries to minimize the average squared error between the network's output, formula_82, and the target value formula_83 over all the example pairs. Minimizing this cost using gradient descent for the class of neural networks called multilayer perceptrons (MLP), produces the backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks.\n\nIn unsupervised learning, some data formula_37 is given and the cost function to be minimized, that can be any function of the data formula_37 and the network's output, formula_36.\n\nThe cost function is dependent on the task (the model domain) and any \"a priori\" assumptions (the implicit properties of the model, its parameters and the observed variables).\n\nAs a trivial example, consider the model formula_87 where formula_88 is a constant and the cost formula_89. Minimizing this cost produces a value of formula_88 that is equal to the mean of the data. The cost function can be much more complicated. Its form depends on the application: for example, in compression it could be related to the mutual information between formula_37 and formula_30, whereas in statistical modeling, it could be related to the posterior probability of the model given the data (note that in both of those examples those quantities would be maximized rather than minimized).\n\nIn reinforcement learning, data formula_37 are usually not given, but generated by an agent's interactions with the environment. At each point in time formula_94, the agent performs an action formula_95 and the environment generates an observation formula_96 and an instantaneous cost formula_97, according to some (usually unknown) dynamics. The aim is to discover a policy for selecting actions that minimizes some measure of a long-term cost, e.g., the expected cumulative cost. The environment's dynamics and the long-term cost for each policy are usually unknown, but can be estimated.\n\nTraining a neural network model essentially means selecting one model from the set of allowed models (or, in a Bayesian framework, determining a distribution over the set of allowed models) that minimizes the cost. Numerous algorithms are available for training neural network models; most of them can be viewed as a straightforward application of optimization theory and statistical estimation.\n\nMost employ some form of gradient descent, using backpropagation to compute the actual gradients. This is done by simply taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to the network parameters and then changing those parameters in a gradient-related direction.\n\nThe optimization algorithm repeats a two phase cycle, propagation and weight update. When an input vector is presented to the network, it is propagated forward through the network, layer by layer, until it reaches the output layer. The output of the network is then compared to the desired output, using a loss function. The resulting error value is calculated for each of the neurons in the output layer. The error values are then propagated from the output back through the network, until each neuron has an associated error value that reflects its contribution to the original output.\nBackpropagation uses these error values to calculate the gradient of the loss function. In the second phase, this gradient is fed to the optimization method, which in turn uses it to update the weights, in an attempt to minimize the loss function."], "wikipedia-1360091": ["For regression analysis problems the squared error can be used as a loss function, for classification the categorical crossentropy can be used.\n\nAs an example consider a regression problem using the square error as a loss:\n\nwhere is the discrepancy or error.\n\nConsider the network on a single training case: formula_8, thus the input formula_2 and formula_3 are 1 and 1 respectively and the correct output, is 0. Now if the actual output is plotted on the horizontal axis against the error on the vertical axis, the result is a parabola. The minimum of the parabola corresponds to the output which minimizes the error . For a single training case, the minimum also touches the horizontal axis, which means the error will be zero and the network can produce an output that exactly matches the expected output . Therefore, the problem of mapping inputs to outputs can be reduced to an optimization problem of finding a function that will produce the minimal error.\n\nHowever, the output of a neuron depends on the weighted sum of all its inputs:\n\nwhere formula_12 and formula_13 are the weights on the connection from the input units to the output unit. Therefore, the error also depends on the incoming weights to the neuron, which is ultimately what needs to be changed in the network to enable learning. If each weight is plotted on a separate horizontal axis and the error on the vertical axis, the result is a parabolic bowl. For a neuron with weights, the same plot would require an elliptic paraboloid of formula_14 dimensions.\n\nOne commonly used algorithm to find the set of weights that minimizes the error is gradient descent. Backpropagation is then used to calculate the steepest descent direction in an efficient way.\n\nThe gradient descent method involves calculating the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network. This is normally done using backpropagation. Assuming one output neuron, the squared error function is\n\nwhere\n\nFor each neuron formula_21, its output formula_22 is defined as\n\nWhere the activation function formula_24 is non-linear and differentiable (even if the ReLU is not in one point). A historically used activation function is the logistic function:\n\nwhich has a convenient derivative of:\n\nThe input formula_27 to a neuron is the weighted sum of outputs formula_28 of previous neurons. If the neuron is in the first layer after the input layer, the formula_28 of the input layer are simply the inputs formula_30 to the network. The number of input units to the neuron is formula_31. The variable formula_32 denotes the weight between neuron formula_33 of the previous layer and neuron formula_21 of the current layer.\n\nCalculating the partial derivative of the error with respect to a weight formula_35 is done using the chain rule twice:\n\nIn the last factor of the right-hand side of the above, only one term in the sum formula_27 depends on formula_35, so that\n\nIf the neuron is in the first layer after the input layer, formula_38 is just formula_39.\n\nThe derivative of the output of neuron formula_21 with respect to its input is simply the partial derivative of the activation function:\n\nThis is the reason why backpropagation requires the activation function to be differentiable. (Nevertheless, the ReLU activation function, which is non-differentiable at 0, has become quite popular, e.g. in AlexNet)\n\nThe first factor is straightforward to evaluate if the neuron is in the output layer, because then formula_42 and\n\nIf the logistic function is used as activation and square error as loss function we can rewrite it as\n\nformula_43\n\nHowever, if formula_21 is in an arbitrary inner layer of the network, finding the derivative formula_16 with respect to formula_22 is less obvious.\n\nConsidering formula_16 as a function with the inputs being all neurons formula_48 receiving input from neuron formula_21,\n\nand taking the total derivative with respect to formula_22, a recursive expression for the derivative is obtained:\n\nTherefore, the derivative with respect to formula_22 can be calculated if all the derivatives with respect to the outputs formula_53 of the next layer \u2013 the ones closer to the output neuron \u2013 are known.\n\nSubstituting , and in we obtain:\n\nwith\n\nif formula_24 is the logistic function, and the error is the square error:\n\nTo update the weight formula_35 using gradient descent, one must choose a learning rate, formula_60. The change in weight needs to reflect the impact on formula_16 of an increase or decrease in formula_35. If formula_63, an increase in formula_35 increases formula_16; conversely, if formula_66, an increase in formula_35 decreases formula_16. The new formula_69 is added to the old weight, and the product of the learning rate and the gradient, multiplied by formula_70 guarantees that formula_35 changes in a way that always decreases formula_16. In other words, in the equation immediately below, formula_73 always changes formula_35 in such a way that formula_16 is decreased:\n\nSection::::Loss function.\nThe loss function is a function that maps values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some \"cost\" associated with those values. For backpropagation, the loss function calculates the difference between the network output and its expected output, after a training example has propagated through the network.\n\nSection::::Loss function.:Assumptions.\nThe mathematical expression of the loss function must fulfill two conditions in order for it to be possibly used in back propagation. The first is that it can be written as an average formula_77 over error functions formula_78, for formula_79 individual training examples, formula_80. The reason for this assumption is that the backpropagation algorithm calculates the gradient of the error function for a single training example, which needs to be generalized to the overall error function. The second assumption is that it can be written as a function of the outputs from the neural network.\n\nSection::::Loss function.:Example loss function.\nLet formula_81 be vectors in formula_82.\n\nSelect an error function formula_83 measuring the difference between two outputs.

This is called a linear classifier. There are many hyperplanes that might classify the data. One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the two classes. So we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized.
