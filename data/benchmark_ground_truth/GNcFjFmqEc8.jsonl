However, the exact answer depends on the context of the original mention.", "wikipedia-57388109": ["The debate about further facts about personal identity over time is most closely associated with Derek Parfit. In his \"Reasons and Persons\", he describes the non-reductionist's view that \"personal identity is a deep further fact, distinct from physical and psychological continuity\". Parfit takes a reductionist stance and argues against this further-fact view. As a result it is not clear whether a person has any reason to be worried about his or her future self in a special way that does not also apply to worrying about others, with Parfit arguing that it is plausible that \"only the deep further fact gives me a reason to be specially concerned about my future\" (his so-called \"Extreme Claim\"). Sydney Shoemaker objects that it is not clear how a further fact would give a reason for such special concerns, either. Harold Langsam has attempted to give a positive account of how a further fact would give such a reason.\nDavid Chalmers lists a number of other types of candidates for further facts. One is facts about conscious experience. For example, it is difficult to see how it follows from the physical facts what it is like to experience seeing red; indeed, inverted spectrum scenarios, where we imagine that experiences of colors are swapped without anything else changing, might suggest that things could have been different without the physical facts changing. Another candidate for a further fact is the fact that there is any conscious experience at all, rather than everyone being a philosophical zombie. Christopher Hill and Brian Mclaughlin have argued against the idea that facts about consciousness are further facts, disputing the logical possibility of a world physically identical to ours in which the facts about consciousness are different.\nChalmers also considers facts about indexicality. He cites the fact that \"\"I\" am David Chalmers\", noting that its significance seems to go beyond the tautology that David Chalmers is David Chalmers. (See also Caspar Hare's egocentric presentism and Benj Hellie's vertiginous question.) Similarly, in the philosophy of time, what date and time it is \"now\" might be considered a candidate for a further fact, in the sense that a being that knows everything about the full four-dimensional block of spacetime would still not know what time it is \"now\". (See also the A-theory and the B-theory of time.)\nA final type of fact that Chalmers considers is that of \"negative\" facts. For example, consider the following statement: there do not exist nonphysical angels. If in fact true, it does not seem that this logically follows from any of the physical facts by themselves; but, he argues, it would follow if one added a \"That is all\" statement at the end of the list of all the physical facts."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-57388109": 1, "wikipedia-393671": 1, "wikipedia-30611075": 1, "wikipedia-58617": 1, "wikipedia-262714": 1, "wikipedia-37816459": 1, "wikipedia-50734392": 1, "wikipedia-1378866": 1, "wikipedia-20693691": 1, "wikipedia-18917": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-57388109": 2, "wikipedia-393671": 1, "wikipedia-30611075": 1, "wikipedia-58617": 1, "wikipedia-262714": 1, "wikipedia-37816459": 1, "wikipedia-50734392": 1, "wikipedia-1378866": 1, "wikipedia-20693691": 1, "wikipedia-18917": 1}}}

This preserves the area because the total area of the strips (triangle) matches the original circle's area (\u03c0r\u00b2). Wikipedia's pages on the \"Area of a circle\" or \"Method of exhaustion\" may provide further context.", "wikipedia-1896782": ["Archimedes used the tools of Euclidean geometry to show that the area inside a circle is equal to that of a right triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius in his book \"Measurement of a Circle\". The circumference is 2\"r\", and the area of a triangle is half the base times the height, yielding the area \u2009\"r\" for the disk."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-173285": 1, "wikipedia-31948928": 1, "wikipedia-161260": 1, "wikipedia-31950365": 1, "wikipedia-1896782": 2, "wikipedia-41638": 1, "wikipedia-48574319": 1, "wikipedia-399730": 1, "wikipedia-315428": 1, "wikipedia-11435202": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-173285": 1, "wikipedia-31948928": 1, "wikipedia-161260": 1, "wikipedia-31950365": 1, "wikipedia-1896782": 3, "wikipedia-41638": 1, "wikipedia-48574319": 1, "wikipedia-399730": 1, "wikipedia-315428": 1, "wikipedia-11435202": 1}}}

A projection is a way for representing an \"n\"-dimensional object in dimensions. For instance, computer screens are two-dimensional, and all the photographs of three-dimensional people, places and things are represented in two dimensions by projecting the objects onto a flat surface. By doing this, the dimension orthogonal to the screen (\"depth\") is removed and replaced with indirect information. The retina of the eye is also a two-dimensional array of receptors but the brain is able to perceive the nature of three-dimensional objects by inference from indirect information (such as shading, foreshortening, binocular vision, etc.). Artists often use perspective to give an illusion of three-dimensional depth to two-dimensional pictures. The \"shadow\", cast by a fictitious grid model of a rotating tesseract on a plane surface, as shown in the figures, is also the result of projections.\nSimilarly, objects in the fourth dimension can be mathematically projected to the familiar three dimensions, where they can be more conveniently examined. In this case, the 'retina' of the four-dimensional eye is a three-dimensional array of receptors. A hypothetical being with such an eye would perceive the nature of four-dimensional objects by inferring four-dimensional depth from indirect information in the three-dimensional images in its retina.\nThe perspective projection of three-dimensional objects into the retina of the eye introduces artifacts such as foreshortening, which the brain interprets as depth in the third dimension. In the same way, perspective projection from four dimensions produces similar foreshortening effects. By applying dimensional analogy, one may infer four-dimensional \"depth\" from these effects.\nAs an illustration of this principle, the following sequence of images compares various views of the three-dimensional cube with analogous projections of the four-dimensional tesseract into three-dimensional space.\nSection::::Dimensional analogy.:Shadows.\nA concept closely related to projection is the casting of shadows.\nIf a light is shone on a three-dimensional object, a two-dimensional shadow is cast.

That is to say, to the eye, from the station point the image of the object is almost indistinguishable from the object itself (the only difference is a minimal perspective projection distortion).\n\nFigure 2 shows the object to be pivoted about the imagined eye to a new position, while maintaining its original face toward the eye. In a natural view, if the pivoting angle is not wide, even if the observer would not turn together with the object, the new object image would appear the same to the eye as it is at the original position because it is projected to the retina, which is concave. Or to say it another way, even if the observer looks at the image in a distorted (skewed) direction the image appears undistorted to the eye.\n\nBut note that the artificial projection image of the object in its new position is different from the original artificial projection image. In other words, the two artificial projection images are different because the intersection angles of the projectors, as they intersect the projection plane, are different. The pivoted image thus exhibits an obvious distortion over the unpivoted image.\n\nIn artificial projection, to avoid additional distortion, the observer is supposed to turn along with the object. This means that the line of sight of the observer, that was directed to the center of the object in its first position, now has to be directed to the center of the object in the second position. As the projection plane should always be perpendicular to the line of sight, it should turn along with it, and thus the object would appear exactly as in the first position. Now, even if the object would not keep its face towards the observer but the observer\u00b4s line of sight would follow it, the object would appear rotated but still with minimal projection distortion (provided that the projection plane was also rotated).\n\nThe difference between the images of the same object produced by \"artificial\" perspective projection and by \"natural\" perspective projection is called \"perspective distortion.\" It should be noted that both \"artificial\" and \"natural\" projection (the image beheld by the eye) foreshorten real objects and that parallel lines appear to intersect, so that is not the difference between them. The distortion is produced by the difference between the concave retina and the flat projection plane.

A motivating example is the distances traveled in a given time. If the speed is constant, only multiplication is needed, but if the speed changes, a more powerful method of finding the distance is necessary. One such method is to approximate the distance traveled by breaking up the time into many short intervals of time, then multiplying the time elapsed in each interval by one of the speeds in that interval, and then taking the sum (a Riemann sum) of the approximate distance traveled in each interval. The basic idea is that if only a short time elapses, then the speed will stay more or less the same. However, a Riemann sum only gives an approximation of the distance traveled. We must take the limit of all such Riemann sums to find the exact distance traveled.\n\nTo approximate that area, an intuitive method would be to divide up the distance between and into a number of equal segments, the length of each segment represented by the symbol .

The \"grounds\" are the evidence used to prove a \"claim\". The \"warrant\" is the assumption or principle that connects the grounds to the claim. All three parts are critical to achieving rhetorical analysis."], "wikipedia-30249": ["Section::::Responses.:Foundationalism.\nPerhaps the chain begins with a belief that is justified, but which is not justified by another belief. Such beliefs are called basic beliefs. In this solution, which is called foundationalism, all beliefs are justified by basic beliefs. Foundationalism seeks to escape the regress argument by claiming that there are some beliefs for which it is improper to ask for a justification. (See also \"a priori\".) This would be a claim that some things (basic beliefs) are true in and of themselves.\nFoundationalism is the belief that a chain of justification begins with a belief that is justified, but which is not justified by another belief. Thus, a belief is justified if and only if:\nBULLET::::1. it is a basic/foundational belief, or\nBULLET::::2. it is justified by a basic belief\nBULLET::::3. it is justified by a chain of beliefs that is ultimately justified by a basic belief or beliefs.\nFoundationalism can be compared to a building. Ordinary individual beliefs occupy the upper stories of the building; basic, or foundational beliefs are down in the basement, in the foundation of the building, holding everything else up. In a similar way, individual beliefs, say about economics or ethics, rest on more basic beliefs, say about the nature of human beings; and those rest on still more basic beliefs, say about the mind; and in the end the entire system rests on a set of basic beliefs which are not justified by other beliefs.\n\nSection::::Responses.:Coherentism.\nAlternatively, the chain of reasoning may loop around on itself, forming a circle. In this case, the justification of any statement is used, perhaps after a long chain of reasoning, in justifying itself, and the argument is circular. This is a version of coherentism.\nCoherentism is the belief that an idea is justified if and only if it is part of a coherent system of mutually supporting beliefs (i.e., beliefs that support each other). In effect Coherentism denies that justification can only take the form of a chain. Coherentism replaces the chain with a holistic web.\nThe most common objection to na\u00efve Coherentism is that it relies on the idea that circular justification is acceptable. In this view, P ultimately supports P, begging the question. Coherentists reply that it is not just P that is supporting P, but P along with the totality of the other statements in the whole system of belief.\nCoherentism accepts any belief that is part of a coherent system of beliefs. In contrast, P can cohere with P and P without P, P or P being true. Instead, Coherentists might say that it is very unlikely that the whole system would be both untrue and consistent, and that if some part of the system was untrue, it would almost certainly be inconsistent with some other part of the system.\nA third objection is that some beliefs arise from experience and not from other beliefs. An example is that one is looking into a room which is totally dark. The lights turn on momentarily and one sees a white canopy bed in the room. The belief that there is a white canopy bed in this room is based entirely on experience and not on any other belief. Of course other possibilities exist, such as that the white canopy bed is entirely an illusion or that one is hallucinating, but the belief remains well-justified. Coherentists might respond that the belief which supports the belief that there is a white canopy bed in this room is that one saw the bed, however briefly. This appears to be an immediate qualifier which does not depend on other beliefs, and thus seems to prove that Coherentism is not true because beliefs can be justified by concepts other than beliefs. But others have argued that the experience of seeing the bed is indeed dependent on other beliefs, about what a bed, a canopy and so on, actually look like.\nAnother objection is that the rule demanding \"coherence\" in a system of ideas seems to be an unjustified belief.\n\nSection::::Responses.:Infinitism.\nInfinitism argues that the chain can go on forever. Critics argue that this means there is never adequate justification for any statement in the chain.\n\nSection::::Responses.:Skepticism.\nSkeptics reject the three above responses and argue that beliefs cannot be justified as beyond doubt. Note that many skeptics do not deny that things may appear in a certain way. However, such sense impressions cannot, in the skeptical view, be used to find beliefs that cannot be doubted. Also, skeptics do not deny that, for example, many laws of nature give the appearance of working or that doing certain things give the appearance of producing pleasure/pain or even that reason and logic seem to be useful tools. Skepticism is in this view valuable since it encourages continued investigation."], "wikipedia-9756633": ["An argument can be thought of as two or more contradicting tree structures.\nBULLET::::- The root of each tree is a claim; A belief supported by information.\nBULLET::::- The root branches out to nodes that are grounds; supporting information.\nBULLET::::- The edges connecting them are warrants; rules or principles.\nBULLET::::- Claims, grounds and warrants are often not known for certain, so they are presented with a qualifier to indicate their probability.\nBULLET::::- When a ground is disputable it is a sub claim, in this way the tree can grow to be quite large.\nThe object of a discussion is often to resolve a difference of opinion.\nThis requires common grounds from which to logically convince your opponent that your claim is better supported and that their claim is supported by false grounds and or warrants. (see Occam's razor) If one has no grounds or warrants to support ones claim, then one has no argument just a belief/claim, probably an inaccurate one."], "wikipedia-797617": ["Habermas argues that when speakers are communicating successfully, they will have to defend their meaning by using these four claims.\nBULLET::::1. That they have \"uttered something\" understandably \u2014 or \"their statements are intelligible\";\nBULLET::::2. That they have given other people \"something to understand\" \u2014 or are speaking \"something true\";\nBULLET::::3. That \"the speaker\" is therefore understandable \u2014 or their \"intentions are recognized and appreciated\" for what they are; and,\nBULLET::::4. That they have come to an understanding \"with another person\" \u2014 or, they have used \"words that both actors can agree upon\". (1979:4)\n\nOne way to grasp this idea is to take an inventory of the ways in which an attempt at communication can misfire, the ways a speech act can fail. A hearer may reject the offering of a speech act on the grounds that it is invalid because it:\nBULLET::::1. presupposes or explicates states of affairs which are not the case (IT);\nBULLET::::2. does not conform to accepted normative expectations (WE);\nBULLET::::3. raises doubts about the intentions or sincerity of the speaker (I).\nOf course, from this it follows that a hearer who accepts the offering of a speech act does so on the grounds that it is valid because it:\nBULLET::::1. presupposes or explicates states of affairs that are true (IT);\nBULLET::::2. conforms to accepted normative expectations (WE);\nBULLET::::3. raises no doubts concerning the intentions or sincerity of the speaker (I)."], "wikipedia-584389": ["For philosophers Richard Feldman and Earl Conee, evidentialism is the strongest argument for justification because it identifies the primary notion of epistemic justification. They argue that if a person's attitude towards a proposition fits their evidence, then their doxastic attitude for that proposition is epistemically justified. Feldman and Conee offer the following argument for evidentialism as an epistemic justification:\n(EJ) Doxastic attitude \"D\" toward proposition \"p\" is epistemically justified for \"S\" at \"t\" if and only if having \"D\" toward \"p\" fits the evidence.\nFor Feldman and Conee a person's doxastic attitude is justified if it fits their evidence.

Referees said that they were \"99% certain\" of the correctness of Hales' proof, and the Kepler conjecture was accepted as a theorem. In 2014, the Flyspeck project team, headed by Hales, announced the completion of a formal proof of the Kepler conjecture using a combination of the Isabelle and HOL Light proof assistants. In 2017, the formal proof was accepted by the journal \"Forum of Mathematics, Pi\".\n\nFollowing the approach suggested by , Thomas Hales, then at the University of Michigan, determined that the maximum density of all arrangements could be found by minimizing a function with 150 variables. In 1992, assisted by his graduate student Samuel Ferguson, he embarked on a research program to systematically apply linear programming methods to find a lower bound on the value of this function for each one of a set of over 5,000 different configurations of spheres. If a lower bound (for the function value) could be found for every one of these configurations that was greater than the value of the function for the cubic close packing arrangement, then the Kepler conjecture would be proved. To find lower bounds for all cases involved solving about 100,000 linear programming problems.\n\nWhen presenting the progress of his project in 1996, Hales said that the end was in sight, but it might take \"a year or two\" to complete. In August 1998 Hales announced that the proof was complete. At that stage, it consisted of 250 pages of notes and 3 gigabytes of computer programs, data and results."], "wikipedia-23798": ["Perelman proved the conjecture by deforming the manifold using the Ricci flow (which behaves similarly to the heat equation that describes the diffusion of heat through an object). The Ricci flow usually deforms the manifold towards a rounder shape, except for some cases where it stretches the manifold apart from itself towards what are known as singularities. Perelman and Hamilton then chop the manifold at the singularities (a process called \"surgery\") causing the separate pieces to form into ball-like shapes. Major steps in the proof involve showing how manifolds behave when they are deformed by the Ricci flow, examining what sort of singularities develop, determining whether this surgery process can be completed and establishing that the surgery need not be repeated infinitely many times.\n\nThe first step is to deform the manifold using the Ricci flow. The Ricci flow was defined by Richard S. Hamilton as a way to deform manifolds. The formula for the Ricci flow is an imitation of the heat equation which describes the way heat flows in a solid. Like the heat flow, Ricci flow tends towards uniform behavior. Unlike the heat flow, the Ricci flow could run into singularities and stop functioning. A singularity in a manifold is a place where it is not differentiable: like a corner or a cusp or a pinching. The Ricci flow was only defined for smooth differentiable manifolds. Hamilton used the Ricci flow to prove that some compact manifolds were diffeomorphic to spheres and he hoped to apply it to prove the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture. He needed to understand the singularities.\n\nHamilton created a list of possible singularities that could form but he was concerned that some singularities might lead to difficulties. He wanted to cut the manifold at the singularities and paste in caps, and then run the Ricci flow again, so he needed to understand the singularities and show that certain kinds of singularities do not occur. Perelman discovered the singularities were all very simple: essentially three-dimensional cylinders made out of spheres stretched out along a line. An ordinary cylinder is made by taking circles stretched along a line. Perelman proved this using something called the \"Reduced Volume\" which is closely related to an eigenvalue of a certain elliptic equation.\n\nSometimes an otherwise complicated operation reduces to multiplication by a scalar (a number). Such numbers are called eigenvalues of that operation. Eigenvalues are closely related to vibration frequencies and are used in analyzing a famous problem: can you hear the shape of a drum? Essentially an eigenvalue is like a note being played by the manifold. Perelman proved this note goes up as the manifold is deformed by the Ricci flow. This helped him eliminate some of the more troublesome singularities that had concerned Hamilton, particularly the cigar soliton solution, which looked like a strand sticking out of a manifold with nothing on the other side. In essence Perelman showed that all the strands that form can be cut and capped and none stick out on one side only.\n\nCompleting the proof, Perelman takes any compact, simply connected, three-dimensional manifold without boundary and starts to run the Ricci flow. This deforms the manifold into round pieces with strands running between them. He cuts the strands and continues deforming the manifold until eventually he is left with a collection of round three-dimensional spheres. Then he rebuilds the original manifold by connecting the spheres together with three-dimensional cylinders, morphs them into a round shape and sees that, despite all the initial confusion, the manifold was in fact homeomorphic to a sphere.\n\nOne immediate question posed was how one could be sure that infinitely many cuts weren't necessary. This was raised due to the cutting potentially progressing forever. Perelman proved this can't happen by using minimal surfaces on the manifold. A minimal surface is essentially a soap film. Hamilton had shown that the area of a minimal surface decreases as the manifold undergoes Ricci flow. Perelman verified what happened to the area of the minimal surface when the manifold was sliced. He proved that eventually the area is so small that any cut after the area is that small can only be chopping off three-dimensional spheres and not more complicated pieces. This is described as a battle with a Hydra by Sormani in Szpiro's book cited below. This last part of the proof appeared in Perelman's third and final paper on the subject."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-368311": 1, "wikipedia-20105205": 1, "wikipedia-26389144": 1, "wikipedia-1209": 1, "wikipedia-9756633": 1, "wikipedia-27952971": 1, "wikipedia-23798": 1, "wikipedia-3553038": 1, "wikipedia-169917": 1, "wikipedia-520190": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-368311": 2, "wikipedia-20105205": 1, "wikipedia-26389144": 1, "wikipedia-1209": 1, "wikipedia-9756633": 1, "wikipedia-27952971": 1, "wikipedia-23798": 2, "wikipedia-3553038": 1, "wikipedia-169917": 1, "wikipedia-520190": 1}}}

Mathematical proofs were revolutionized by Euclid (300 BCE), who introduced the axiomatic method still in use today, starting with undefined terms and axioms (propositions regarding the undefined terms assumed to be self-evidently true from the Greek \"axios\" meaning \"something worthy\"), and used these to prove theorems using deductive logic."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

For comparison, secant lines intersect a circle at two points, whereas another line may not intersect a circle at all.

As a special case, as in the case of a square, the area of a square with side length is given by the formula:\nThe formula for the area of a rectangle follows directly from the basic properties of area, and is sometimes taken as a definition or axiom. On the other hand, if geometry is developed before arithmetic, this formula can be used to define multiplication of real numbers.\nSection::::Area formulas.:Polygon formulas.:Dissection, parallelograms, and triangles.\nMost other simple formulas for area follow from the method of dissection.\nThis involves cutting a shape into pieces, whose areas must sum to the area of the original shape.\nFor an example, any parallelogram can be subdivided into a trapezoid and a right triangle, as shown in figure to the left. If the triangle is moved to the other side of the trapezoid, then the resulting figure is a rectangle. It follows that the area of the parallelogram is the same as the area of the rectangle:\nHowever, the same parallelogram can also be cut along a diagonal into two congruent triangles, as shown in the figure to the right.

Given a circle of radius , it is possible to partition the circle into sectors, as shown in the figure to the right. Each sector is approximately triangular in shape, and the sectors can be rearranged to form an approximate parallelogram. The height of this parallelogram is , and the width is half the circumference of the circle, or . Thus, the total area of the circle is :\nThough the dissection used in this formula is only approximate, the error becomes smaller and smaller as the circle is partitioned into more and more sectors. The limit of the areas of the approximate parallelograms is exactly , which is the area of the circle.\nThis argument is actually a simple application of the ideas of calculus. In ancient times, the method of exhaustion was used in a similar way to find the area of the circle, and this method is now recognized as a precursor to integral calculus.

It can be seen as the three-dimensional version of the polar coordinate system.\nThe radial distance is also called the \"radius\" or \"radial coordinate\". The polar angle may be called \"colatitude\", \"zenith angle\", \"normal angle\", or \"inclination angle\".\nThe spherical coordinate system generalizes the two-dimensional polar coordinate system. It can also be extended to higher-dimensional spaces and is then referred to as a hyperspherical coordinate system.\nTo define a spherical coordinate system, one must choose two orthogonal directions, the \"zenith\" and the \"azimuth reference\", and an \"origin\" point in space. These choices determine a reference plane that contains the origin and is perpendicular to the zenith. The spherical coordinates of a point are then defined as follows:\nBULLET::::- The \"radius\" or \"radial distance\" is the Euclidean distance from the origin to .\nBULLET::::- The \"inclination\" (or \"polar angle\") is the angle between the zenith direction and the line segment .\nBULLET::::- The \"azimuth\" (or \"azimuthal angle\") is the signed angle measured from the azimuth reference direction to the orthogonal projection of the line segment on the reference plane.\nThe sign of the azimuth is determined by choosing what is a \"positive\" sense of turning about the zenith. This choice is arbitrary, and is part of the coordinate system's definition.\nThe \"elevation\" angle is 90 degrees ( radians) minus the inclination angle.\nIf the inclination is zero or 180 degrees ( radians), the azimuth is arbitrary. If the radius is zero, both azimuth and inclination are arbitrary.\nIn linear algebra, the vector from the origin to the point is often called the \"position vector\" of \"P\"."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-174026": 1, "wikipedia-39653582": 1, "wikipedia-39499535": 1, "wikipedia-29181": 2, "wikipedia-3928533": 1, "wikipedia-2039039": 1, "wikipedia-650405": 1, "wikipedia-731780": 1, "wikipedia-1425534": 1, "wikipedia-2335732": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-174026": 1, "wikipedia-39653582": 1, "wikipedia-39499535": 1, "wikipedia-29181": 3, "wikipedia-3928533": 1, "wikipedia-2039039": 1, "wikipedia-650405": 1, "wikipedia-731780": 1, "wikipedia-1425534": 1, "wikipedia-2335732": 1}}}
