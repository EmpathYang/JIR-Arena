Listeners are uniquely subject to background music with no control over its volume and content. The range of responses created are of great variety, and even opposite, depending on numerous factors such as, setting, culture, audience, and even time of day.\nBackground music is commonly played where there is no audience at all, such as empty hallways and restrooms and fitting rooms. It is also used in artificial space, such as music played while on hold during a telephone call, and virtual space, as in the ambient sounds or thematic music in massively multiplayer online role-playing games. It is typically played at low volumes from multiple small speakers distributing the music across broad public spaces.The widespread use of background music in offices, restaurants, and stores began with the founding of Muzak in the 1930s and was characterized by repetition and simple musical arrangements. Its use has grown worldwide and today incorporates the findings of psychological research relating to consumer behavior in retail environments, employee productivity, and workplace satisfaction.\nDue to the growing variety of settings (from doctors offices to airports), many styles of music are utilized as background music. Because the aim of background music is passive listening, vocals, commercial interruptions, and complexity are typically avoided. In spite of the international distribution common to syndicated background music artists, it is often associated with artistic failure and a lack of musical talent in the entertainment industry.

Four more rise up in the center floating above the others. The pinnacle of the statue is a female holding a tambourine.

The theme of the sculpture is music, because of the historical and economic significance of the site. This is the heart of Music Row, the area and the artistic activity for which Nashville is best known. The sculpture conveys the importance of music to Nashville, past, present and future, and represents all forms of music without reference to any one form or style. It is meant to provide a visual icon for the area and for the city as a whole. The theme is music, but the sculpture represents artistic creativity itself.

For example, when riding down the diagonal, a rider may struggle to keep his horse on the correct path, suggesting issues with straightness.

This way of ranking allows us to aggregate performance over an arbitrary number of functions and targets, while inherently managing uncertainty of the performance metrics by doing the repeated rounds and comparing individual values for each 'game'.}"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-317062": 1, "wikipedia-13493982": 1, "wikipedia-312438": 1, "wikipedia-3283709": 1, "wikipedia-10504683": 1, "wikipedia-11325429": 1, "wikipedia-165373": 1, "wikipedia-6993242": 1, "wikipedia-189018": 1, "wikipedia-944465": 1, "arxiv-2406.16674": 1, "arxiv-1704.04818": 1, "arxiv-1209.1112": 1, "arxiv-2006.12433": 1, "arxiv-1906.10686": 1, "arxiv-2203.02956": 1, "arxiv-2207.01482": 1, "arxiv-1808.08840": 1, "arxiv-1007.2844": 1, "arxiv-2201.08692": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/42": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/36": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/15": 2, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/12": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/43": 2, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/25": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/38": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/39": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-317062": 1, "wikipedia-13493982": 2, "wikipedia-312438": 2, "wikipedia-3283709": 1, "wikipedia-10504683": 1, "wikipedia-11325429": 1, "wikipedia-165373": 1, "wikipedia-6993242": 2, "wikipedia-189018": 1, "wikipedia-944465": 1, "arxiv-2406.16674": 1, "arxiv-1704.04818": 1, "arxiv-1209.1112": 1, "arxiv-2006.12433": 1, "arxiv-1906.10686": 1, "arxiv-2203.02956": 1, "arxiv-2207.01482": 1, "arxiv-1808.08840": 1, "arxiv-1007.2844": 1, "arxiv-2201.08692": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/42": 2, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/36": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/15": 3, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/12": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/43": 3, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/25": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/38": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/39": 1}}}

Where finding an optimal solution is impossible or impractical, heuristic methods can be used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution. Heuristics can be mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making a decision. Examples that employ heuristics include using a rule of thumb, an educated guess, an intuitive judgment, a guesstimate, profiling, or common sense.\nHeuristics are the strategies derived from previous experiences with similar problems. These strategies rely on using readily accessible, though loosely applicable, information to control problem solving in human beings, machines, and abstract issues.\nThe most fundamental heuristic is trial and error, which can be used in everything from matching nuts and bolts to finding the values of variables in algebra problems.\nIn psychology, heuristics are simple, efficient rules, learned or inculcated by evolutionary processes, that have been proposed to explain how people make decisions, come to judgements, and solve problems typically when facing complex problems or incomplete information. Researchers test if people use those rules with various methods. These rules work well under most circumstances, but in certain cases lead to systematic errors or cognitive biases.\nSimon's original, primary object of research was problem solving which showed that we operate within what he calls bounded rationality. He coined the term \"satisficing\", which denotes the situation where people seek solutions or accept choices or judgments that are \"good enough\" for their purposes, but could be optimized.\nGerd Gigerenzer and his research group argued that models of heuristics need to be formal to allow for predictions of behavior that can be tested. They study the fast and frugal heuristics in the \"adaptive toolbox\" of individuals or institutions, and the ecological rationality of these heuristics, that is the conditions under which a given heuristic is likely successful. The descriptive study of the \"adaptive toolbox\" is done by observation and experiment, the prescriptive study of the ecological rationality requires mathematical analysis and computer simulation. Heuristics \u2013 such as the recognition heuristic, the take-the-best heuristic, and fast-and-frugal trees \u2013 have been shown to be effective in predictions, particularly in situations of uncertainty. It is often said that heuristics trade accuracy for effort but this is only the case in situations of risk. Risk refers to situations where all possible actions, their outcomes and probabilities are known. In the absence of this information, that is under uncertainty, heuristics can achieve higher accuracy with lower effort. This finding, known as a less-is-more effect, would not have been found without formal models. The valuable insight of this program is that heuristics are effective because of, not despite, their simplicity. Furthermore, Gigerenzer and Wolfgang Gaissmaier found that both individuals and organizations rely on heuristics in an adaptive way."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

Nevergrad also provides interfaces to the following benchmark collections:  LSGO~\\cite{lsgo}, YABBOB~\\cite{versatile}, Pyomo~\\cite{pyomo}, MLDA~\\cite{mlda}, and MuJoCo~\\cite{mujoco}. \nThe performance evaluation, however, is much more basic than those of COCO or \\iohana, in that only the quality of the finally recommended point(s) is stored, but no information about the search trajectory. That is, apart from taking a \\emph{fixed-budget perspective}, Nevergrad does not store performance traces, but only the final output. \\iohana can interpret and visualize the csv files produced by Nevergrad. An extension of Nevergrad to allow for the same tracking features as \\iohana is currently under construction, in a joint collaborative effort between the Nevergrad and the \\iohana development teams. \nFocusing on the algorithm design task, HeuristicLab~\\cite{HeuristicLab} provides a relatively large collection of various IOHs (e.g., population-based search algorithms) as well as machine learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Regression), which are represented as graphs of operators. In HeuristicLab, new algorithms can be constructed by combining existing operators in a graphical user interface, avoiding the laborious coding details. While IOHprofiler mainly targets the black-box optimization problem, HeuristicLab incorporates a very diversified set of benchmark problems, ranging from the symbolic regression to data analysis problems. It implements the parallel execution of algorithms for the ease of benchmarking. In contrast to IOHanalyzer, which is available via a web interface and contains many detailed performance analyses and interactive plots, HeuristicLab is distributed via platform-dependent applications and includes some basic static plots (e.g., box plots) for assessing the empirical performance from a \\emph{fixed-budget perspective}. Several other tools have been developed for displaying performance data and/or the search behavior in decision space.

Such data might represent the temperature at different locations (two-way data) sampled over different times (the third dimension, leading to three-way data)\nBULLET::::- \"Four-way data\", using the same spreadsheet analogy, can be represented as a file folder full of separate workbooks.\nBULLET::::- \"Five-way data\" and \"six-way data\" can be represented by similarly higher levels of data aggregation."], "wikipedia-515580": ["BULLET::::- Breaching experiment : A method for revealing, or exposing, the common work that is performed by members of particular social groups in maintaining a clearly recognisable and shared social order. For example, driving the wrong way down a busy one-way street can reveal myriads of useful insights into the patterned social practices, and moral order, of the community of road users. The point of such an exercise\u2014a person pretending to be a stranger or boarder in his own household\u2014is to demonstrate that gaining insight into the work involved in maintaining any given social order can often best be revealed by breaching that social order and observing the results of that breach\u2014especially those activities related to the reassembly of that social order, and the normalisation of that social setting.\nBULLET::::- Sacks' gloss : A question about an aspect of the social order that recommends, as a method of answering it, that the researcher should seek out members of society who, in their daily lives, are responsible for the maintenance of that aspect of the social order. This is in opposition to the idea that such questions are best answered by a sociologist. Sacks' original question concerned objects in public places and how it was possible to see that such objects did or did not belong to somebody. He found his answer in the activities of police officers who had to decide whether cars were abandoned.\nBULLET::::- Durkheim's aphorism : Durkheim famously recommended: \"...our basic principle, that of the objectivity of social facts.\" This is usually taken to mean that we should assume the objectivity of social facts as a principle of study (thus providing the basis of sociology as a science). Garfinkel's alternative reading of Durkheim is that we should treat the objectivity of social facts as an achievement of society's members, and make the achievement process itself the focus of study. An ethnomethodological respecification of Durkheim's statement via a \"misreading\" (see below) of his quote appears above. There is also a textual link/rationale provided in the literature. Both links involve a leap of faith on the part of the reader; that is, we don't believe that one method for this interpretation is necessarily better than the other, or that one form of justification for such an interpretation outweighs its competitor.\nBULLET::::- Accounts : Accounts are the ways members signify, describe or explain the properties of a specific social situation. They can consist of both verbal and non-verbal objectifications. They are always both indexical to the situation in which they occur (see below), and, simultaneously reflexive\u2014they serve to constitute that situation. An account can consist of something as simple as a wink of the eye, a material object evidencing a state of affairs (documents, etc.), or something as complex as a story detailing the boundaries of the universe.\nBULLET::::- Indexicality : The concept of indexicality is a key core concept for ethnomethodology. Garfinkel states that it was derived from the concept of indexical expressions appearing in ordinary language philosophy (1967), wherein a statement is considered to be indexical insofar as it is dependent for its sense upon the context in which it is embedded (Bar-Hillel 1954:359\u2013379). The phenomenon is acknowledged in various forms of analytical philosophy, and sociological theory and methods, but is considered to be both limited in scope and remedied through specification operationalisation. In ethnomethodology, the phenomenon is universalised to all forms of language and behavior, and is deemed to be beyond remedy for the purposes of establishing a scientific description and explanation of social behavior. The consequence of the degree of contextual dependence for a \"segment\" of talk or behavior can range from the problem of establishing a \"working consensus\" regarding the description of a phrase, concept or behavior, to the end-game of social scientific description itself. Note that any serious development of the concept must eventually assume a theory of meaning as its foundation (see Gurwitsch 1985). Without such a foundational underpinning, both the traditional social scientist and the ethnomethodologist are relegated to merely telling stories around the campfire (Brooks 1974).\nBULLET::::- Misreading (a text) : Misreading a text, or fragments of a text, does not denote making an erroneous reading of a text in whole or in part. As Garfinkel states, it means to denote an, \"alternate reading\", of a text or fragment of a text. As such, the original and its misreading do not, \"...translate point to point\", but, \"...instead, they go together.\" No criteria are offered for the translation of an original text and its misreading\u2014the outcome of such translations are in Garfinkel's term: \"incommensurable.\" The misreading of texts or fragments of texts is a standard feature of ethnomethodology's way of doing theory, especially in regards to topics in phenomenology.\nBULLET::::- Reflexivity : Despite the fact that many sociologists use \"reflexivity\" as a synonym for \"self-reflection,\" the way the term is used in ethnomethodology is different: it is meant \"to describe the acausal and non-mentalistic determination of meaningful action-in-context.\" See also: Reflexivity (social theory).\nBULLET::::- Documentary method of interpretation : The documentary method is the method of understanding utilised by everyone engaged in trying to make sense of their social world\u2014this includes the ethnomethodologist. Garfinkel recovered the concept from the work of Karl Mannheim and repeatedly demonstrates the use of the method in the case studies appearing in his central text, Studies in Ethnomethodology. Mannheim defined the term as a search for an identical homologous pattern of meaning underlying a variety of totally different realisations of that meaning. Garfinkel states that the documentary method of interpretation consists of treating an actual appearance as the \"document of\", \"as pointing to\", as \"standing on behalf of\", a presupposed underlying pattern. These \"documents\" serve to constitute the underlying pattern, but are themselves interpreted on the basis of what is already known about that underlying pattern. This seeming paradox is quite familiar to hermeneuticians who understand this phenomenon as a version of the hermeneutic circle. This phenomenon is also subject to analysis from the perspective of Gestalt theory (part/whole relationships), and the phenomenological theory of perception.\nBULLET::::- Social orders : Theoretically speaking, the object of ethnomethodological research is social order taken as a group members' concern. Methodologically, social order is made available for description in any specific social setting as an accounting of specific social orders: the sensible coherencies of accounts that order a specific social setting for the participants relative to a specific social project to be realised in that setting. Social orders themselves are made available for both participants and researchers through phenomena of order: the actual accounting of the partial () appearances of these sensibly coherent social orders. These appearances (parts, adumbrates) of social orders are embodied in specific accounts, and employed in a particular social setting by the members of the particular group of individuals party to that setting. Specific social orders have the same formal properties as identified by A. Gurwitsch in his discussion of the constituent features of perceptual \"noema\", and, by extension, the same relationships of meaning described in his account of Gestalt Contextures (see Gurwitsch 1964:228\u2013279). As such, it is little wonder that Garfinkel states: \"you can't do anything unless you do read his texts.\""], "wikipedia-10669964": ["Five general perspectives are often cited in pharmacoeconomics, including institutional, third party, patient, governmental and societal.

Job performance is no longer considered to consist strictly of performance on a task. Rather, with an increasingly competitive job market, employees are expected to go above and beyond the requirements listed in their job descriptions. Contextual performance, which is defined as activities that contribute to the social and psychological core of the organization, is beginning to be viewed as equally important to task performance. Examples of contextual performance include volunteering for additional work, following organizational rules and procedures even when personally inconvenient, assisting and cooperating with coworkers, and various other discretionary behaviors. By strengthening the viability of social networks, these activities are posited to enhance the psychological climate in which the technical core is nested.\n\nThe counterpart to contextual performance is task performance. Task performance is defined as the work activities that contribute to an organization\u2019s technical core. Contextual performance is more likely to be voluntary in nature, whereas task performance is more likely to be prescribed by the formal job role. Despite the fact that contextual performance is more discretionary in nature, research indicates that managers include these behaviors when conducting performance evaluations. This highlights the fact that these behaviors are becoming more and more a requirement on the job.\n\nContextual performance has been found to be related to overall employee job performance. A significant portion of supervisor ratings can be accounted for by not just task performance, but contextual performance as well. Other organizational outcomes such as turnover (employment) have been found to be related to contextual performance. Indeed, research shows that contextual performance is a significant predictor of turnover over and above task performance. Employees displaying more contextual performance behaviors were less likely to turnover than those engaging in less contextual performance behaviors. While also touted as a predictor of contextual performance, organizational commitment has been found to be an outcome of contextual performance. The facet of interpersonal facilitation significantly predicts organizational commitment. Research generally supports that contextual performance does indeed relate to overall organization performance as measured by quality, quantity, financial measures, and customer service measures."], "wikipedia-2883565": ["The applications of notation have been defined as:\nBULLET::::1. tactical evaluation,\nBULLET::::2. technical evaluation,\nBULLET::::3. analysis of movement,\nBULLET::::4. development of a database and modelling, and\nBULLET::::5. for educational use with both coaches and players.\nMost pieces of research using notation, or indeed any practical applications working directly with coaches and athletes, will span more than one of these purposes."], "wikipedia-20000400": ["Job performance assesses whether a person performs a job well. Job performance, studied academically as part of industrial and organizational psychology, also forms a part of human resources management. Performance is an important criterion for organizational outcomes and success. John P. Campbell describes job performance as an individual-level variable, or something a single person does. This differentiates it from more encompassing constructs such as organizational performance or national performance, which are higher-level variables.\nFirst, Campbell defines performance as behavior, which is something done by an employee. This concept differentiates performance from outcomes. Outcomes result partially from an individual's performance, but they are also the result of other influences. In other words, there are more factors determine outcomes than just an employee's behaviors and actions.\nCampbell allows for exceptions when defining performance as behavior. For instance, he clarifies that performance does not have to be directly observable actions of an individual. It can consist of mental productions such as answers or decisions. However, performance needs to be under the individual's control, regardless of whether the performance of interest is mental or behavioral.\nAnother closely related construct is productivity.\nOne can think of productivity as a comparison of the amount of effectiveness that results from a certain level of cost associated with that effectiveness. In other words, effectiveness is the ratio of outputs to inputs\u2014those inputs being effort, monetary costs, resources, etc.\nUtility, another related construct, is defined as the value of a particular level of performance, effectiveness, or productivity. Utilities of performance, effectiveness, and productivity are value judgments.\nAnother key feature of job performance is that it has to be goal relevant. Performance must be directed toward organizational goals that are relevant to the job or role. Therefore, performance does not include activities where effort is expended toward achieving peripheral goals. For example, the effort put toward the goal of getting to work in the shortest amount of time is not performance (except where it is concerned with avoiding lateness).\nDespite the emphasis on defining and predicting job performance, it is not a single unified construct. There are vastly many jobs each with different performance standards. Therefore, job performance is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct consisting of more than one kind of behavior. Campbell (1990) proposed an eight factor model of performance based on factor analytic research that attempts to capture dimensions of job performance existent (to a greater or lesser extent) across all jobs.\nBULLET::::1. The first factor is task specific behaviors which include those behaviors that an individual undertakes as part of a job. They are the core substantive tasks that delineate one job from another.\nBULLET::::2. On the other hand, non-task specific behaviors, the second factor, are those behaviors which an individual is required to undertake which do not pertain only to a particular job. Returning to the sales person, an example of a task specific behavior would be showing a product to a potential customer. A non-task specific behavior of a sales person might be training new staff members.\nBULLET::::3. Written and oral communication tasks refer to activities where the incumbent is evaluated, not on the content of a message necessarily, but on the adeptness with which they deliver the communication. Employees need to make formal and informal oral and written presentations to various audiences in many different jobs in the work force.\nBULLET::::4. An individual's performance can also be assessed in terms of effort, either day to day, or when there are extraordinary circumstances. This factor reflects the degree to which people commit themselves to job tasks.\nBULLET::::5. The performance domain might also include an aspect of personal discipline. Individuals would be expected to be in good standing with the law, not abuse alcohol, etc.\nBULLET::::6. In jobs where people work closely or are highly interdependent, performance may include the degree to which a person helps out the groups and his or her colleagues. This might include acting as a good role model, coaching, giving advice or helping maintain group goals.\nBULLET::::7. Many jobs also have a supervisory or leadership component. The individual will be relied upon to undertake many of the things delineated under the previous factor and in addition will be responsible for meting out rewards and punishments. These aspects of performance happen in a face to face manner.\nBULLET::::8. Managerial and administrative performance entails those aspects of a job which serve the group or organization but do not involve direct supervision. A managerial task would be setting an organizational goal or responding to external stimuli to assist a group in achieving its goals. In addition a manager might be responsible for monitoring group and individual progress towards goals and monitoring organizational resources."], "wikipedia-37683658": ["Performance appraisals, also known as performance evaluations, are assessments that many organizations use to measure individuals' productivity, ability and talent in their respective job positions. The goal of these appraisals is not only to measure each person's performance, but also to align all of the employee's values, goals and motivations and become a better performing organization as a whole. \n\nPerformance evaluations have been based on various operational or financial measures of performance, but no one factor provides a clear indication of productive or ineffective performance. The response has been to focus on too many measures on which to base performance assessment. Some of the various perspectives that are often considered when measuring evaluation are customers' perspectives, internal business perspectives, innovation perspective and financial perspectives.\n\nSince many organizations depend on customers for profit, companies primarily evaluate employees based on their performance with customers. These customer reviews are then used to shape how companies function internally, directing what kinds of goals employees should have to achieve the company's overall mission. Then, organizations can assess performance based on the products that employees create.

Also, there are reasons to believe that ground support personnel and crew members experience many of the same basic issues regarding teamwork and performance.\nEfforts have been made within spaceflight operations to identify factors that are important for selecting individual crew members for long duration spaceflight. There has also been an analytical study to identify the skills necessary for long and short duration missions to inform the initial astronaut candidate selection process. In this study, twenty experts (including astronauts) rated 47 relevant skills on criticality and another 42 environmental and work demands on their probability of occurrence.\nThis resulted in 10 broad factors that were deemed important for long-duration missions:\n- performance under stressful conditions\n- mental/emotional stability\n- judgement/decision making\n- teamwork skills\n- conscientiousness\n- family issues\n- group living skills\n- motivation\n- communication skills\n- leadership capabilities\nCohesive teams are more productive than less cohesive teams. This situation could be because:\n- more productive teams become more cohesive,\nor\n- more cohesive teams become more productive.\nTeams preserve their cohesion when they succeed rather than fail. Therefore, applied scientists advise it is important to promote three essential conditions for team performance:\n- ability (knowledge and skills) - Team members need to have sufficient levels of interpersonal and technical skills to perform their jobs and to attain team objectives.\n- motivation - Team members must also be motivated to use their knowledge and skills to achieve shared goals.\n- coordination strategy - Team context (organizational context, team design, and team culture) must create conditions to avoid problems such as social loafing, free riding, or diffusion of responsibility.\nPsychosocial experts within the spaceflight community have articulated their concern that interpersonal conflicts and lack of cohesion will impede the abilities of crews to perform tasks accurately, efficiently, or in a coordinated manner during long-duration missions.\nFrom the evidence, it cannot be said that lack of team cohesion is statistically likely to result in numerous performance errors or an observable failure, but it does seem likely that ignoring the relationship between cohesion and performance will result in sub-optimal performance.

Employees displaying more contextual performance behaviors were less likely to turnover than those engaging in less contextual performance behaviors. While also touted as a predictor of contextual performance, organizational commitment has been found to be an outcome of contextual performance.

This concept differentiates performance from outcomes. Outcomes result partially from an individual's performance, but they are also the result of other influences. In other words, there are more factors determine outcomes than just an employee's behaviors and actions.\n\nCampbell allows for exceptions when defining performance as behavior. For instance, he clarifies that performance does not have to be directly observable actions of an individual. It can consist of mental productions such as answers or decisions. However, performance needs to be under the individual's control, regardless of whether the performance of interest is mental or behavioral.\n\nThe difference between individual controlled action and outcomes is best conveyed through an example. In a sales job, a favorable outcome is a certain level of revenue generated through the sale of something (merchandise, or some service such as insurance). Revenue can be generated or not, depending on the behavior of employees. When the employee performs this sales job well, he is able to move more merchandise. However, certain factors other than employees' behavior influence revenue generated. For example, sales might slump due to economic conditions, changes in customer preferences, production bottlenecks, etc. In these conditions, employee performance can be adequate, yet sales can remain low. The first is performance and the second is the effectiveness of that performance. One can de-couple these two because performance is not the same as effectiveness.\n\nAnother closely related construct is productivity.\nOne can think of productivity as a comparison of the amount of effectiveness that results from a certain level of cost associated with that effectiveness. In other words, effectiveness is the ratio of outputs to inputs\u2014those inputs being effort, monetary costs, resources, etc.\n\nUtility, another related construct, is defined as the value of a particular level of performance, effectiveness, or productivity. Utilities of performance, effectiveness, and productivity are value judgments.\n\nSection::::Features.:Organizational goal relevance.\nAnother key feature of job performance is that it has to be goal relevant. Performance must be directed toward organizational goals that are relevant to the job or role. Therefore, performance does not include activities where effort is expended toward achieving peripheral goals. For example, the effort put toward the goal of getting to work in the shortest amount of time is not performance (except where it is concerned with avoiding lateness).\n\nSection::::Features.:Multidimensionality.\nDespite the emphasis on defining and predicting job performance, it is not a single unified construct. There are vastly many jobs each with different performance standards. Therefore, job performance is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct consisting of more than one kind of behavior. Campbell (1990) proposed an eight factor model of performance based on factor analytic research that attempts to capture dimensions of job performance existent (to a greater or lesser extent) across all jobs.\n\nBULLET::::1. The first factor is task specific behaviors which include those behaviors that an individual undertakes as part of a job. They are the core substantive tasks that delineate one job from another.\nBULLET::::2. On the other hand, non-task specific behaviors, the second factor, are those behaviors which an individual is required to undertake which do not pertain only to a particular job. Returning to the sales person, an example of a task specific behavior would be showing a product to a potential customer. A non-task specific behavior of a sales person might be training new staff members.\nBULLET::::3. Written and oral communication tasks refer to activities where the incumbent is evaluated, not on the content of a message necessarily, but on the adeptness with which they deliver the communication. Employees need to make formal and informal oral and written presentations to various audiences in many different jobs in the work force.\nBULLET::::4. An individual's performance can also be assessed in terms of effort, either day to day, or when there are extraordinary circumstances. This factor reflects the degree to which people commit themselves to job tasks.\nBULLET::::5. The performance domain might also include an aspect of personal discipline. Individuals would be expected to be in good standing with the law, not abuse alcohol, etc.\nBULLET::::6. In jobs where people work closely or are highly interdependent, performance may include the degree to which a person helps out the groups and his or her colleagues. This might include acting as a good role model, coaching, giving advice or helping maintain group goals.\nBULLET::::7. Many jobs also have a supervisory or leadership component. The individual will be relied upon to undertake many of the things delineated under the previous factor and in addition will be responsible for meting out rewards and punishments. These aspects of performance happen in a face to face manner.\nBULLET::::8. Managerial and administrative performance entails those aspects of a job which serve the group or organization but do not involve direct supervision. A managerial task would be setting an organizational goal or responding to external stimuli to assist a group in achieving its goals. In addition a manager might be responsible for monitoring group and individual progress towards goals and monitoring organizational resources.\n\nAnother taxonomy of job performance was proposed and developed for the US Navy by Murphy (1994). This model is significantly broader and breaks performance into only four dimensions.\n\nBULLET::::1. Task-oriented behaviors are similar to task-specific behaviors in Campbell's model. This dimension includes any major tasks relevant to someone's job.\nBULLET::::2. Interpersonally oriented behaviors are represented by any interaction the focal employee has with other employees. These can be task related or non-task related. This dimension diverges from Campbell's taxonomy because it included behaviors (small talk, socializing, etc.) that are not targeting an organization's goal.\nBULLET::::3. Down-time behaviors are behaviors that employees engage in during their free time either at work or off-site. Down-time behaviors that occur off-site are only considered job performance when they subsequently affect job performance (for example, outside behaviors that cause absenteeism).\nBULLET::::4. Destructive/hazardous behaviors.\n\nIn addition to these models dividing performance into dimensions, others have identified different types of behaviors making up performance.\n\nSection::::Types.\nAnother way to divide up performance is in terms of task and contextual (citizenship and counterproductive) behaviors. Whereas task performance describes obligatory behaviors, contextual behaviors are behaviors that do not fulfill specific aspects of the job's required role. Citizenship behaviors are defined as behaviors which contribute to the goals of the organization through their effect on the social and psychological conditions. Counterproductive behaviors, on the other hand, are intentional actions by employees which circumvent the aims of the organization.\n\nSection::::Determinants.\nCampbell (1990) also suggested determinants of performance components. Individual differences on performance are a function of three main determinants: declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge and skill, and motivation.\n\nDeclarative knowledge represents the knowledge of a given task's requirements. For instance, declarative knowledge includes knowledge of principles, facts, ideas, etc.\n\nIf declarative knowledge is knowing what to do, procedural knowledge and skill is knowing how to do it. For example, procedural knowledge and skill includes cognitive skill, perceptual skill, interpersonal skill, etc.\n\nThe third predictor of performance is motivation, which refers to \"a combined effect from three choice behaviors\u2014choice to expend effort, choice of level of effort to expend, and choice to persist in the expenditure of that level of effort\" (Campbell, 1990). It reflects the direction, intensity, and persistence of volitional behaviors. Campbell (1990) emphasized that the only way to discuss motivation as a direct determinant of behavior is as one or more of these choices. (See also \"Work motivation\".)\n\nCampbell (1990) also mentioned several performance parameters that may have important implications for the job performance setting and should be investigated by industrial and organizational psychologists.\n\nThe first one is the distinction between speed and accuracy. This distinction is similar to the one between quantity and quality. Important questions that should be considered include: which is most valued by the organization, maximized speed, maximized accuracy, or some balance between the two? What kind of trade offs should an employee makes? The latter question is important because speed and accuracy for the same task may be independent of one another.\n\nThe second distinction is between typical and maximum performance. Sackett, Zedeck, and Fogli did a study on supermarket cashiers and found that there was a substantial difference between scores reflecting their typical performance and scores reflecting their maximum performance. This study suggested the distinction between typical and maximum performance. Regular work situations reflect varying levels of motivation which result in typical performance. Special circumstances generate maximum employee motivation which results in maximum performance.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of organizational justice perceptions on performance is believed to stem from Equity Theory. This would suggest that when people perceive injustice they seek to restore justice. One way that employees restore justice is by altering their level of performance. Procedural justice affects performance as a result of its impact on employee attitudes. Distributive justice affects performance when efficiency and productivity are involved. Improving justice perceptions improves productivity and performance."], "wikipedia-37683658": ["Performance appraisals, also known as performance evaluations, are assessments that many organizations use to measure individuals' productivity, ability and talent in their respective job positions. The goal of these appraisals is not only to measure each person's performance, but also to align all of the employee's values, goals and motivations and become a better performing organization as a whole. While the implementation of performance evaluations has been characterized as beneficial and even essential for organizational success, many of these performance evaluations have also become more ineffective over time due to both the excessive number of evaluation measures and employee reactivity to these evaluations.\n\nPerformance evaluations have been based on various operational or financial measures of performance, but no one factor provides a clear indication of productive or ineffective performance. The response has been to focus on too many measures on which to base performance assessment. Some of the various perspectives that are often considered when measuring evaluation are customers' perspectives, internal business perspectives, innovation perspective and financial perspectives.\n\nSince many organizations depend on customers for profit, companies primarily evaluate employees based on their performance with customers. These customer reviews are then used to shape how companies function internally, directing what kinds of goals employees should have to achieve the company's overall mission. Then, organizations can assess performance based on the products that employees create. Finally, financial performance measures should be a focus to identify how employee achievements contribute to the business' profitability.\n\nThese four measures extract important information about employees using performance evaluations. However, a rising market in the design of performance assessment has led to a system overload of even more evaluation measures. Having so many measures of evaluation and consequently, multiple grading scales for assessment, has often led to incompetent performance appraisals."], "wikipedia-325286": ["The dynamics of strategy and performance concerns the \u2018content\u2019 of strategy \u2013 initiatives, choices, policies and decisions adopted in an attempt to improve performance, and the results that arise from these managerial behaviors.\n\nThe essential problem is that tools explaining why firm A performs better than firm B at a point in time are unlikely to explain why firm B is growing its performance more rapidly than firm A.\n\nThis is needed, is a set of tools that explain how performance changes over time, and how to improve its future trajectory \u2013 i.e. a dynamic model of strategy and performance.\n\nThe asset-stocks relevant to strategy performance are resources [things we have] and capabilities [things we are good at doing]. This makes it possible to connect back to the resource-based view, though with one modification. RBV asserts that any resource which is clearly identifiable, and can easily be acquired or built, cannot be a source of competitive advantage, so only resources or capabilities that are valuable, rare, hard to imitate or buy, and embedded in the organization [the \u2018VRIO\u2019 criteria] can be relevant to explaining performance, for example reputation or product development capability.

Secondly, we took the largest value among all such 2\\% percentiles as the target value on this function. \nIn this radar-plot, we revert the axis such that the bigger ERT values are further away from the center of the circle compared to smaller ones, indicating that better algorithms will cover a larger area.\n\nIn this group, ECDFs of running times are aggregated across multiple functions, as defined in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:ECDF-agg-fct}. This functionality is illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:GUI-ECDF-fct}: a table of pre-calculated target values are provided for each function (all test functions are included by default). This table of targets can easily be edited directly in the GUI, or by a downloading-editing-uploading procedure (which should, of course, not change the format of the tables, just the values).\n{Note that for these ECDF-figures, the corresponding Area Under the Curve (AUC) can also be calculated to get a single value for each algorithm. These AUC-tables are available in the same tab as the ECDF plot.}\n\nThis group provides a ranking functionality to compare algorithms across multiple functions and dimensions, in which we employ the Glicko-2 rating system~\\cite{glickman2012example} (commonly used in chess games) to rank the algorithms, based on multiple simulated games between them ($25$ by default). In each game, for every function and dimension, the winner of each pair of algorithms is determined by sampling from the running time values (given a target value) uniformly at random and checking which random sample is better. An overall rating is computed from those games' outcome, which is then used to rank the algorithms. {Algorithms with a better rank win more rounds than those with a poor rank, indicating that when sampling a runtime on an arbitrary function, these algorithms tend to perform better. This way of ranking allows us to aggregate performance over an arbitrary number of functions and targets, while inherently managing uncertainty of the performance metrics by doing the repeated rounds and comparing individual values for each 'game'.}"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-504357": 1, "wikipedia-1850623": 1, "wikipedia-39294": 1, "wikipedia-30864300": 1, "wikipedia-288276": 1, "wikipedia-54326317": 1, "wikipedia-35951900": 1, "wikipedia-20736": 1, "wikipedia-14592469": 1, "wikipedia-2261519": 1, "arxiv-1708.02696": 1, "arxiv-2207.09286": 1, "arxiv-2303.15913": 1, "arxiv-2106.01503": 1, "arxiv-2105.00502": 1, "arxiv-2402.05502": 1, "arxiv-1207.4044": 1, "arxiv-1512.02921": 1, "arxiv-2207.04344": 1, "arxiv-2311.18760": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/11": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/30": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/32": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/23": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/42": 2, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/14": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/43": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-504357": 1, "wikipedia-1850623": 1, "wikipedia-39294": 2, "wikipedia-30864300": 1, "wikipedia-288276": 1, "wikipedia-54326317": 1, "wikipedia-35951900": 1, "wikipedia-20736": 2, "wikipedia-14592469": 1, "wikipedia-2261519": 1, "arxiv-1708.02696": 1, "arxiv-2207.09286": 1, "arxiv-2303.15913": 1, "arxiv-2106.01503": 1, "arxiv-2105.00502": 1, "arxiv-2402.05502": 1, "arxiv-1207.4044": 1, "arxiv-1512.02921": 1, "arxiv-2207.04344": 1, "arxiv-2311.18760": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/35": 2, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/11": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/30": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/32": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/23": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/42": 3, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/14": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/43": 2}}}

The COCO software has a strong focus on \\emph{fixed-target performances}~\\cite{COCOperformance}, i.e., on the time needed to find a solution of a certain quality. \nCOCO has been a major source of inspiration for the development of IOHprofiler. What concerns the performance assessment, the key difference between COCO and our \\iohana is in the {interactive interface that allows users of \\iohana to study different performance measures, to change their ranges, and granularity}. As mentioned, COCO performance files can be conveniently analyzed by \\iohana.\nAnother important software environment for benchmarking sampling-based optimization heuristics is the \\pkg{Nevergrad} framework~\\cite{nevergrad}. As with COCO, Nevergrad implements functionalities for both experimentation and performance analysis, accommodating continuous, discrete, and mixed-integer problems. It has a strong focus on noisy optimization, but also comprises several noise-free optimization problems. In addition to studying IOHs, Nevergrad has a special suite to compare one-shot optimization techniques, i.e., non-iterative solvers. The current focus of Nevergrad is to be seen on the problem side, as it offers several new benchmark problems, such as the structured optimization problems which are aggregated in their own test suite. Nevergrad also provides interfaces to the following benchmark collections:  LSGO~\\cite{lsgo}, YABBOB~\\cite{versatile}, Pyomo~\\cite{pyomo}, MLDA~\\cite{mlda}, and MuJoCo~\\cite{mujoco}. \nThe performance evaluation, however, is much more basic than those of COCO or \\iohana, in that only the quality of the finally recommended point(s) is stored, but no information about the search trajectory. That is, apart from taking a \\emph{fixed-budget perspective}, Nevergrad does not store performance traces, but only the final output. \\iohana can interpret and visualize the csv files produced by Nevergrad. An extension of Nevergrad to allow for the same tracking features as \\iohana is currently under construction, in a joint collaborative effort between the Nevergrad and the \\iohana development teams. \nFocusing on the algorithm design task, HeuristicLab~\\cite{HeuristicLab} provides a relatively large collection of various IOHs (e.g., population-based search algorithms) as well as machine learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Regression), which are represented as graphs of operators. In HeuristicLab, new algorithms can be constructed by combining existing operators in a graphical user interface, avoiding the laborious coding details. While IOHprofiler mainly targets the black-box optimization problem, HeuristicLab incorporates a very diversified set of benchmark problems, ranging from the symbolic regression to data analysis problems. It implements the parallel execution of algorithms for the ease of benchmarking. In contrast to IOHanalyzer, which is available via a web interface and contains many detailed performance analyses and interactive plots, HeuristicLab is distributed via platform-dependent applications and includes some basic static plots (e.g., box plots) for assessing the empirical performance from a \\emph{fixed-budget perspective}."], "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/39": ["In this and the next section we use an exemplary data set called ``sample_data'' prepared for this article, which comprises selected performance data from the study presented in~\\cite{DoerrYHWSB20}.

Models like MODFLOW and SUMMA, a program from NCAR that simulates surface processes like rainfall-runoff and gully erosion, make this kind of testing more definitive and controlled. This results because other aspects of the program remain the same. Tests become more definitive because they become less prone to being influenced unknowingly by other numerical and programming differences."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

This way of ranking allows us to aggregate performance over an arbitrary number of functions and targets, while inherently managing uncertainty of the performance metrics by doing the repeated rounds and comparing individual values for each 'game'.}"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-25920056": 1, "wikipedia-19931987": 1, "wikipedia-5908991": 1, "wikipedia-44041262": 1, "wikipedia-221400": 1, "wikipedia-464331": 1, "wikipedia-5730974": 1, "wikipedia-5216974": 1, "wikipedia-20526418": 1, "wikipedia-897558": 1, "arxiv-1906.00200": 1, "arxiv-2109.09618": 1, "arxiv-1907.02035": 1, "arxiv-1701.08888": 1, "arxiv-0908.2584": 1, "arxiv-1301.0952": 1, "arxiv-1203.1076": 1, "arxiv-0806.3017": 1, "arxiv-1610.05464": 1, "arxiv-1609.09774": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/38": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/36": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/43": 2, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/41": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/42": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/45": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/34": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/12": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-25920056": 1, "wikipedia-19931987": 1, "wikipedia-5908991": 1, "wikipedia-44041262": 1, "wikipedia-221400": 1, "wikipedia-464331": 1, "wikipedia-5730974": 1, "wikipedia-5216974": 1, "wikipedia-20526418": 1, "wikipedia-897558": 1, "arxiv-1906.00200": 1, "arxiv-2109.09618": 1, "arxiv-1907.02035": 1, "arxiv-1701.08888": 1, "arxiv-0908.2584": 1, "arxiv-1301.0952": 1, "arxiv-1203.1076": 1, "arxiv-0806.3017": 1, "arxiv-1610.05464": 1, "arxiv-1609.09774": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/38": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/36": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/43": 3, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/41": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/42": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/45": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/34": 1, "paper/18/2007.03953/IOHanalyzer-final-arXiv.jsonl/12": 1}}}

Originally designed to compare derivative-free optimization algorithms operating on numeric optimization problems~\\cite{Comparing31}, the tool has seen several extensions in the last years, e.g., towards multi-objective optimization~\\cite{COCOemo}, mixed-integer optimization~\\cite{COCOmip}, and large-scale optimization~\\cite{bbob-large-ASOC}. COCO consists of an experimentation part that produces data files with detailed performance traces, and an automated data analysis part in which a fixed number of standardized analyses are automatically generated. The by far most reported performance measures from the COCO framework are \\emph{empirical cumulative distribution function} (ECDF) curves, see Section~\\ref{sec:background} for definitions. The COCO software has a strong focus on \\emph{fixed-target performances}~\\cite{COCOperformance}, i.e., on the time needed to find a solution of a certain quality.\nAnother important software environment for benchmarking sampling-based optimization heuristics is the \\pkg{Nevergrad} framework~\\cite{nevergrad}. As with COCO, Nevergrad implements functionalities for both experimentation and performance analysis, accommodating continuous, discrete, and mixed-integer problems. It has a strong focus on noisy optimization, but also comprises several noise-free optimization problems. In addition to studying IOHs, Nevergrad has a special suite to compare one-shot optimization techniques, i.e., non-iterative solvers. The current focus of Nevergrad is to be seen on the problem side, as it offers several new benchmark problems, such as the structured optimization problems which are aggregated in their own test suite.

This process is repeated as many times as necessary.\nMike Kuniavsky further notes that it is \u201cthe process of understanding the impact of design on an audience.\u201d The types of user research you can or should perform will depend on the type of site, system or app you are developing, your timeline, and your environment.\nSection::::Methods.\nA wide range of research methods are available in the field of user research. To better understand when to use which method, it is helpful to view them along a 3-dimensional framework with the following axes:\nBULLET::::- Attitudinal vs. behavioral\nBULLET::::- Qualitative vs. quantitative\nBULLET::::- Context of use\nWith respect to user research in the field of design, research is typically approached with an empathetic perspective in order to humanize data collected about people. This method can also be referred to a human-centred approach to problem solving. User researcher aims to uncover the barriers or frustrations users face as they interact with products, services, or systems. A unique facet of user research is the brand of user experience (UX) research which focuses on the feelings, thoughts, and situations users go through as they interact with products, services, and systems. Professionals that work to understand these obstacles are referred to as UX researchers. \nSection::::Methods.:Qualitative methods.\nBULLET::::- Ethnographic studies\nBULLET::::- Guerrilla testing\nBULLET::::- Scenarios\nBULLET::::- Personas\nBULLET::::- Expert review\nBULLET::::- Focus groups\nBULLET::::- Card sorting\nBULLET::::- Contextual design\nBULLET::::- Parallel design\nBULLET::::- Prototyping\nBULLET::::- Task analysis\nBULLET::::- Content analysis\nSection::::Methods.:Quantitative methods.\nBULLET::::- Surveys\nBULLET::::- First click testing\nBULLET::::- Eye tracking\nBULLET::::- Web analytics\nBULLET::::- A/B testing"], "wikipedia-504357": ["Generative methods may also be used including: card sorting, affinity diagramming and participatory design sessions. In addition, user requirements can be inferred by careful analysis of usable products similar to the product being designed.\nBULLET::::- Cooperative design: involving designers and users on an equal footing. This is the Scandinavian tradition of design of IT artifacts and it has been evolving since 1970. This is also called Co-design.\nBULLET::::- Participatory design (PD), a North American term for the same concept, inspired by Cooperative Design, focusing on the participation of users. Since 1990, there has been a bi-annual Participatory Design Conference.\nBULLET::::- Contextual design, \"customer-centered design\" in the actual context, including some ideas from Participatory design\nHere are principles that will ensure a design is user centered:\nBULLET::::2. Users are involved throughout design and development.\nBULLET::::3. The design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation.\nBULLET::::4. The process is iterative.\nBULLET::::1. Specify context of use: Identify who the primary users of the product, why they will use the product, what are their requirements and under what environment they will use it.\nBULLET::::2. Specify Requirements: Once the context is specified, it is the time to identify the granular requirements of the product. This is an important process which can further facilitate the designers to create storyboards, and set important goals to make the product successful.\nBULLET::::3. Create Design solutions and development: Based on product goals and requirements, start an iterative process of product design and development.\nBULLET::::4. Evaluate Product: Product designers do usability testing to get users' feedback of the product. Product evaluation is a crucial step in product development which gives critical feedback of the product."], "wikipedia-15864355": ["During this development, the user analysis is the basic research phase which takes place before actual drafting of the technology's technical documentation. In this way, it's typically the first step of the document composition process. Such an analysis is intended to result in tacit knowledge, or a set of facts regarding the users' values, behaviors, knowledge of the documentation and product and motivation for using said documentation and product. Revealing the tacit knowledge of users' activities, as opposed to the simple operations which a given technology can perform, is often referred to as an unspoken but understood trick of the trade for the technical communicators who conduct user analyses.\nUser analysis is a process which calls for qualitative research. Because such research usually (though not always) centers around human subjects, the degree of formality and personalness is an issue. In the modern era, users are often reached via virtual communities, which themselves often form around the use of a particular technology.\nBesides traditional way to interacting with users, analysis can be done with statistical analysis of the usage of log of users. With artificial techniques like machine learning, tremendous analysis results can be generated in parallel."], "wikipedia-44879635": ["Contextual inquiry is a field data collection technique used to capture detailed information about how users of a product interact with the product in their normal environment.
