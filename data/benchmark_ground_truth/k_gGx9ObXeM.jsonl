Sim et al [46] investigated fun, usability and learning in an educational software with seven and eight year-old children and found no correlation between learning (measured by the difference between the post- and pre-test scores) and fun or between fun and usability. In line with their findings, Iten and Petko [ 22] studying a serious game with child participants aged between 10 to 13 also found no significant relationship between fun and learning (perceived learning and measured learning calculated as the summary score for the current answers for the pre- and post-test). Contrasting these earlier findings, Tisza, Zhu and Markopoulos [55] found when investigating a serious game with 14-15 years old students that having fun while learning had a significant effect on students\u2019 perceived learning, but not on their measured learning (when considering their pre and post outcomes). Lucardie [31] investigating fun and enjoyment in adults\u2019 learning found that both learners and their teachers perceived fun as a motivator to attend classes, and as a contributor to learning knowledge and new skills. Related to coding, Long [30] studying the influence of a programming game on learners\u2019 (mostly adults) programming skills and knowledge found that about 80% of the study participants reported a perceived increase. They also found that 87.5% of the study participants joined because of the anticipated fun of the learning game, making fun a strong motivator for participation. Therefore, having an enjoyable or amusing time (i.e. fun) while learning is a significant predictor for the learning effort. Saez-Lopez et al [40] found in a two-year long study that using Scratch - a block-based visual programming interface - to teach programming to primary school children significantly increased students\u2019 knowledge; furthermore, students reported on having fun while learning with Scratch, a finding that is also supported by the observers\u2019 reports. However, that study did not examine the relationship between fun and learning. Complementary to this, Tisza and Markopoulos [52] found that having fun while learning to program contributed significantly to the perceived learning of primary school children. As it is seen, there is a variety in earlier research in terms of the assessment of learning. While some examined perceived learning [30, 31, 52], others investigated measured learning (i.e., pre-post tests) [40, 46, 55]. To our best knowledge, there are only a few studies that report on the relationship between fun and both the perceived and the measured learning [22, 54, 55]. All of those studies report on regression analyses, indicating a slight difference between the two measures, however, without directly comparing them.

Sim et al [46] investigated fun, usability and learning in an educational software with seven and eight year-old children and found no correlation between learning (measured by the difference between the post- and pre-test scores) and fun or between fun and usability. In line with their findings, Iten and Petko [ 22] studying a serious game with child participants aged between 10 to 13 also found no significant relationship between fun and learning (perceived learning and measured learning calculated as the summary score for the current answers for the pre- and post-test). Contrasting these earlier findings, Tisza, Zhu and Markopoulos [55] found when investigating a serious game with 14-15 years old students that having fun while learning had a significant effect on students\u2019 perceived learning, but not on their measured learning (when considering their pre and post outcomes). Lucardie [31] investigating fun and enjoyment in adults\u2019 learning found that both learners and their teachers perceived fun as a motivator to attend classes, and as a contributor to learning knowledge and new skills. Related to coding, Long [30] studying the influence of a programming game on learners\u2019 (mostly adults) programming skills and knowledge found that about 80% of the study participants reported a perceived increase. They also found that 87.5% of the study participants joined because of the anticipated fun of the learning game, making fun a strong motivator for participation. Therefore, having an enjoyable or amusing time (i.e. fun) while learning is a significant predictor for the learning effort. Saez-Lopez et al [40] found in a two-year long study that using Scratch - a block-based visual programming interface - to teach programming to primary school children significantly increased students\u2019 knowledge; furthermore, students reported on having fun while learning with Scratch, a finding that is also supported by the observers\u2019 reports. However, that study did not examine the relationship between fun and learning. Complementary to this, Tisza and Markopoulos [52] found that having fun while learning to program contributed significantly to the perceived learning of primary school children. As it is seen, there is a variety in earlier research in terms of the assessment of learning. While some examined perceived learning [30, 31, 52], others investigated measured learning (i.e., pre-post tests) [40, 46, 55]. To our best knowledge, there are only a few studies that report on the relationship between fun and both the perceived and the measured learning [22, 54, 55]. All of those studies report on regression analyses, indicating a slight difference between the two measures, however, without directly comparing them. Accordingly, understanding the relationship between the perceived and the measured learning, especially in reflection of the experienced fun while learning remains a topic to be addressed by future research. In sum, while earlier research appeared to be inconclusive on the role that fun plays on learning, recent empirical research results are supportive that fun contributes positively to the learning outcomes.

The problem design enables students to evaluate their solutions according to the needs of a client identified in the problem situation and sustain themselves in productive, progressively effective cycles of conceptualizing and problem solving. Model-eliciting activities (MEAs) are ideally structured to help students build their real-world sense of problem solving towards increasingly powerful mathematical constructs. What is especially useful for mathematics educators and researchers is the capacity of MEAs to make students' thinking visible through their models and modeling cycles. Teachers do not prompt the use of particular mathematical concepts or their representational counterparts when presenting the problems. Instead, they choose activities that maximize the potential for students to develop the concepts that are the focal point in the curriculum by building on their early and intuitive ideas. The mathematical models emerge from the students' interactions with the problem situation and learning is assessed via these emergent behaviors.\nSection::::Specific applications.:Activities that can be used as assessment tools in math and science classrooms.:Generative activities.\nIn a generative activity, students are asked to come up with outcomes that are mathematically same. Students can arrive at the responses or build responses from this sameness in a wide range of ways. The sameness gives coherence to the task and allows it to be an \"organizational unit for performing a specific function.\" (Stroup et al., 2004)\nOther activities can also be used as the means of formative assessment as long as they ensure the participation of every student, make students' thoughts visible to each other and to the teacher, promote feedback to revise and refine thinking.

These biases play the role of exaggerating or diminishing program effects. Not only that, but the direction the bias may take cannot usually be known in advance (Rossi et al., 2004). These biases affect the interest of the stakeholder. Furthermore, it is possible that program participants are disadvantaged if the bias is in such a way that it contributes to making an ineffective or harmful program seem effective. There is also the possibility that a bias can make an effective program seem ineffective or even as far as harmful. This could possibly make the accomplishments of program seem small or even insignificant therefore forcing the personnel and even cause the program's sponsors to reduce or eliminate the funding for the program (Rossi et al., 2004).\nBiases are normally visible in two situations: when the measurement of the outcome with program exposure or the estimate of what the outcome would have been without the program exposure is higher or lower than the corresponding \"true\" value (p267). Unfortunately, not all forms of bias that may compromise impact assessment are obvious (Rossi et al., 2004)."], "wikipedia-619350": ["Of course, it is also possible that during the process of trying to elicit the logic model behind a program the evaluators may discover that such a model is either incompletely developed, internally contradictory, or (in worst cases) essentially nonexisistent. This decidedly limits the effectiveness of the evaluation, although it does not necessarily reduce or eliminate the program. \n\nLooking at the different components of a program in relation to the overall short-term and long-term goals allows for illumination of potential misalignments. \n\nProcess analysis looks beyond the theory of what the program is supposed to do and instead evaluates how the program is being implemented. This evaluation determines whether the components identified as critical to the success of the program are being implemented. The evaluation determines whether target populations are being reached, people are receiving the intended services, staff are adequately qualified. Process evaluation is an ongoing process in which repeated measures may be used to evaluate whether the program is being implemented effectively. This problem is particularly critical because many innovations, particularly in areas like education and public policy, consist of fairly complex chains of action. Many of which these elements rely on the prior correct implementation of other elements, and will fail if the prior implementation was not done correctly. Since incorrect or ineffective implementation will produce the same kind of neutral or negative results that would be produced by correct implementation of a poor innovation, it is essential that evaluation research assess the implementation process itself. Otherwise, a good innovative idea may be mistakenly characterized as ineffective, where in fact it simply had never been implemented as designed.", "It is important to ensure that the instruments (for example, tests, questionnaires, etc.) used in program evaluation are as reliable, valid and sensitive as possible. According to Rossi et al. (2004, p. 222), 'a measure that is poorly chosen or poorly conceived can completely undermine the worth of an impact assessment by producing misleading estimates. Only if outcome measures are valid, reliable and appropriately sensitive can impact assessments be regarded as credible'.\n\nThe reliability of a measurement instrument is the 'extent to which the measure produces the same results when used repeatedly to measure the same thing' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 218). The more reliable a measure is, the greater its statistical power and the more credible its findings. If a measuring instrument is unreliable, it may dilute and obscure the real effects of a program, and the program will 'appear to be less effective than it actually is' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 219). Hence, it is important to ensure the evaluation is as reliable as possible.\n\nThe validity of a measurement instrument is 'the extent to which it measures what it is intended to measure' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 219). This concept can be difficult to accurately measure: in general use in evaluations, an instrument may be deemed valid if accepted as valid by the stakeholders (stakeholders may include, for example, funders, program administrators, et cetera).\n\nThe principal purpose of the evaluation process is to measure whether the program has an effect on the social problem it seeks to redress; hence, the measurement instrument must be sensitive enough to discern these potential changes (Rossi et al., 2004). A measurement instrument may be insensitive if it contains items measuring outcomes which the program couldn't possibly effect, or if the instrument was originally developed for applications to individuals (for example standardized psychological measures) rather than to a group setting (Rossi et al., 2004). These factors may result in 'noise' which may obscure any effect the program may have had.\n\nOnly measures which adequately achieve the benchmarks of reliability, validity and sensitivity can be said to be credible evaluations. It is the duty of evaluators to produce credible evaluations, as their findings may have far reaching effects. A discreditable evaluation which is unable to show that a program is achieving its purpose when it is in fact creating positive change may cause the program to lose its funding undeservedly.\n\nAll in all, time, monetary and data constraints can have negative implications on the validity, reliability and transferability of the evaluation. The shoestring approach has been created to assist evaluators to correct the limitations identified above by identifying ways to reduce costs and time, reconstruct baseline data and to ensure maximum quality under existing constraints (Bamberger et al., 2004)."], "wikipedia-62433": ["However, the strict adherence to a set of methodological assumptions may make the field of evaluation more acceptable to a mainstream audience but this adherence will work towards preventing evaluators from developing new strategies for dealing with the myriad problems that programs face.\nIt is claimed that only a minority of evaluation reports are used by the evaluand (client) (Datta, 2006). One justification of this is that \"when evaluation findings are challenged or utilization has failed, it was because stakeholders and clients found the inferences weak or the warrants unconvincing\" (Fournier and Smith, 1993). Some reasons for this situation may be the failure of the evaluator to establish a set of shared aims with the evaluand, or creating overly ambitious aims, as well as failing to compromise and incorporate the cultural differences of individuals and programs within the evaluation aims and process.\nNone of these problems are due to a lack of a definition of evaluation but are rather due to evaluators attempting to impose predisposed notions and definitions of evaluations on clients. The central reason for the poor utilization of evaluations is arguably due to the lack of tailoring of evaluations to suit the needs of the client, due to a predefined idea (or definition) of what an evaluation is rather than what the client needs are (House, 1980).\nEvaluating programs and projects, regarding their value and impact within the context they are implemented, can be ethically challenging. Evaluators may encounter complex, culturally specific systems resistant to external evaluation. Furthermore, the project organization or other stakeholders may be invested in a particular evaluation outcome. Finally, evaluators themselves may encounter \"conflict of interest (COI)\" issues, or experience interference or pressure to present findings that support a particular assessment.", "- Accountability is popular with constituents because it is intended to provide an accurate accounting of results that can improve the quality of products and services. However, this approach quickly can turn practitioners and consumers into adversaries when implemented in a heavy-handed fashion.\n- Decision-oriented studies are designed to provide a knowledge base for making and defending decisions. This approach usually requires the close collaboration between an evaluator and decision-maker, allowing it to be susceptible to corruption and bias.\n- Policy studies provide general guidance and direction on broad issues by identifying and assessing potential costs and benefits of competing policies. The drawback is these studies can be corrupted or subverted by the politically motivated actions of the participants.\n- Consumer-oriented studies are used to judge the relative merits of goods and services based on generalized needs and values, along with a comprehensive range of effects. However, this approach does not necessarily help practitioners improve their work, and it requires a very good and credible evaluator to do it well.\n- Accreditation / certification programs are based on self-study and peer review of organizations, programs, and personnel. They draw on the insights, experience, and expertise of qualified individuals who use established guidelines to determine if the applicant should be approved to perform specified functions. However, unless performance-based standards are used, attributes of applicants and the processes they perform often are overemphasized in relation to measures of outcomes or effects.\n- Connoisseur studies use the highly refined skills of individuals intimately familiar with the subject of the evaluation to critically characterize and appraise it. This approach can help others see programs in a new light, but it is difficult to find a qualified and unbiased connoisseur.\n- The adversary approach focuses on drawing out the pros and cons of controversial issues through quasi-legal proceedings. This helps ensure a balanced presentation of different perspectives on the issues, but it is also likely to discourage later cooperation and heighten animosities between contesting parties if \"winners\" and \"losers\" emerge.\n- Client-centered studies address specific concerns and issues of practitioners and other clients of the study in a particular setting. These studies help people understand the activities and values involved from a variety of perspectives. However, this responsive approach can lead to low external credibility and a favorable bias toward those who participated in the study."], "wikipedia-34000999": ["Within the international development context, participatory evaluation is not without challenges. Since stakeholders are such a crucial element to participatory evaluation, a major challenge to this method is ensuring that the right groups have been included in evaluation methods. Further still, the challenge is identifying what practices and data collection methods work best when collaborating with stakeholders, especially when working with multiple stakeholder groups that have clashing values and objectives. Another challenge to implementing participatory evaluation methods is maintaining the balance in power dynamics between different stakeholders of the development project, including the evaluation team itself. As part of project teams, evaluation teams hold an authoritative position and these evaluators have the potential to hold more power than local stakeholders. Ultimately, this power balance can be reflected by skewed results."], "wikipedia-29738569": ["Does Theory of Change frustrate or complement strategic thinking? This is an ongoing and important discussion, especially as there is an increasing emphasis on and demand for strategy as grounded, flexible, and opportunity-driven. Some perspectives understand ToC as a fixed model that gets in the way of effective work and useful evaluation. However, Patrizi notes that ToC is only at odds with strategic behavior if an organization treats their ToC like any other fixed plan. As Patrizi writes: \u201cOnce assumptions [in a theory of change] are laid out, 1) foundations don't actually test those assumptions, and 2) they don't see using the model as a continuous process. It is, like, \u2018Well, we did our ToC and now we are done\u2019. If the change model is instead treated as something to adjust as organizations learn what works from experience in the field, then the theory should not be at odds with strategic behavior. If strategy is about seizing opportunities and trying out what works, the Theory of Change model serves as a guiding frame of reference. A list is not a model; a list does not push practitioners to consider the goals as part of a systematic model of change, or to think critically\u2014strategically\u2014about how best to attain the outcomes along the pathway.\n\nGiven that things don\u2019t happen in a straight-line sequence \u2013 as things impact each other in multiple, partly unpredictable ways, with all kinds of feedback loops that aren\u2019t modeled in a top-down diagramming format \u2013 an important question is: How adequate is the linear Theory of Change model as a description of what\u2019s going to happen? One answer to the question is that Theory of Change does not, in fact, model how things happen; rather, it models how we believe things will happen. Theory of Change is a forecast that shows what conditions we believe must exist for other conditions to come into being. Because it is forward looking and logical, Theory of Change reflects the way we think logically \u2013that is, if a, then b\u2014and chronologically\u2014first this, then that. The linear format is therefore appropriate. It can be helpful to complement Theory of Change with a process model that shows how the Theory of Change fits into a larger, more cyclical scheme in which theory leads to action, which leads to monitoring and evaluation, which leads to adjustment of the theory, which leads to the next action, more monitoring and evaluation, and so on. Such a process model depicts the linear theory as a conceptual driver of change, which must, to remain useful, be accompanied not only by taking action but also by evaluation and recalibration."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This could possibly make the accomplishments of program seem small or even insignificant therefore forcing the personnel and even cause the program's sponsors to reduce or eliminate the funding for the program (Rossi et al., 2004).", "There is intensive debate in academic circles around the appropriate methodologies for impact evaluation, between proponents of experimental methods on the one hand and proponents of more general methodologies on the other. William Easterly has referred to this as 'The Civil War in Development economics'. Proponents of experimental designs, sometimes referred to as 'randomistas', argue randomization is the only means to ensure unobservable selection bias is accounted for, and that building up the flimsy experimental evidence base should be developed as a matter of priority. In contrast, others argue that randomized assignment is seldom appropriate to development interventions and even when it is, experiments provide us with information on the results of a specific intervention applied to a specific context, and little of external relevance. There has been criticism from evaluation bodies and others that some donors and academics over-emphasize favoured methods for impact evaluation, and that this may in fact hinder learning and accountability. In addition, there has been a debate around the appropriate role for qualitative methods within impact evaluations."], "wikipedia-619350": ["Of course, it is also possible that during the process of trying to elicit the logic model behind a program the evaluators may discover that such a model is either incompletely developed, internally contradictory, or (in worst cases) essentially nonexisistent. This decidedly limits the effectiveness of the evaluation, although it does not necessarily reduce or eliminate the program.", "Section::::Reliability, validity and sensitivity in program evaluation.\nIt is important to ensure that the instruments (for example, tests, questionnaires, etc.) used in program evaluation are as reliable, valid and sensitive as possible. According to Rossi et al. (2004, p. 222), 'a measure that is poorly chosen or poorly conceived can completely undermine the worth of an impact assessment by producing misleading estimates. Only if outcome measures are valid, reliable and appropriately sensitive can impact assessments be regarded as credible'.\nSection::::Reliability, validity and sensitivity in program evaluation.:Reliability.\nThe reliability of a measurement instrument is the 'extent to which the measure produces the same results when used repeatedly to measure the same thing' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 218). The more reliable a measure is, the greater its statistical power and the more credible its findings. If a measuring instrument is unreliable, it may dilute and obscure the real effects of a program, and the program will 'appear to be less effective than it actually is' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 219). Hence, it is important to ensure the evaluation is as reliable as possible.\nSection::::Reliability, validity and sensitivity in program evaluation.:Validity.\nThe validity of a measurement instrument is 'the extent to which it measures what it is intended to measure' (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 219). This concept can be difficult to accurately measure: in general use in evaluations, an instrument may be deemed valid if accepted as valid by the stakeholders (stakeholders may include, for example, funders, program administrators, et cetera).\nSection::::Reliability, validity and sensitivity in program evaluation.:Sensitivity.\nThe principal purpose of the evaluation process is to measure whether the program has an effect on the social problem it seeks to redress; hence, the measurement instrument must be sensitive enough to discern these potential changes (Rossi et al., 2004). A measurement instrument may be insensitive if it contains items measuring outcomes which the program couldn't possibly effect, or if the instrument was originally developed for applications to individuals (for example standardized psychological measures) rather than to a group setting (Rossi et al., 2004). These factors may result in 'noise' which may obscure any effect the program may have had.\nOnly measures which adequately achieve the benchmarks of reliability, validity and sensitivity can be said to be credible evaluations. It is the duty of evaluators to produce credible evaluations, as their findings may have far reaching effects. A discreditable evaluation which is unable to show that a program is achieving its purpose when it is in fact creating positive change may cause the program to lose its funding undeservedly.", "However, there are many hurdles and challenges which evaluators face when attempting to implement an evaluation program which attempts to make use of techniques and systems which are not developed within the context to which they are applied. Some of the issues include differences in culture, attitudes, language and political process.\nCulture is defined by Ebbutt (1998, p. 416) as a \"constellation of both written and unwritten expectations, values, norms, rules, laws, artifacts, rituals and behaviors that permeate a society and influence how people behave socially\". Culture can influence many facets of the evaluation process, including data collection, evaluation program implementation and the analysis and understanding of the results of the evaluation. In particular, instruments which are traditionally used to collect data such as questionnaires and semi-structured interviews need to be sensitive to differences in culture, if they were originally developed in a different cultural context. The understanding and meaning of constructs which the evaluator is attempting to measure may not be shared between the evaluator and the sample population and thus the transference of concepts is an important notion, as this will influence the quality of the data collection carried out by evaluators as well as the analysis and results generated by the data.\nLanguage also plays an important part in the evaluation process, as language is tied closely to culture. Language can be a major barrier to communicating concepts which the evaluator is trying to access, and translation is often required. There are a multitude of problems with translation, including the loss of meaning as well as the exaggeration or enhancement of meaning by translators. For example, terms which are contextually specific may not translate into another language with the same weight or meaning. In particular, data collection instruments need to take meaning into account as the subject matter may not be considered sensitive in a particular context might prove to be sensitive in the context in which the evaluation is taking place. Thus, evaluators need to take into account two important concepts when administering data collection tools: lexical equivalence and conceptual equivalence. Lexical equivalence asks the question: how does one phrase a question in two languages using the same words? This is a difficult task to accomplish, and uses of techniques such as back-translation may aid the evaluator but may not result in perfect transference of meaning. This leads to the next point, conceptual equivalence. It is not a common occurrence for concepts to transfer unambiguously from one culture to another. Data collection instruments which have not undergone adequate testing and piloting may therefore render results which are not useful as the concepts which are measured by the instrument may have taken on a different meaning and thus rendered the instrument unreliable and invalid."], "wikipedia-62433": ["BULLET::::- Accountability is popular with constituents because it is intended to provide an accurate accounting of results that can improve the quality of products and services. However, this approach quickly can turn practitioners and consumers into adversaries when implemented in a heavy-handed fashion.\nBULLET::::- Decision-oriented studies are designed to provide a knowledge base for making and defending decisions. This approach usually requires the close collaboration between an evaluator and decision-maker, allowing it to be susceptible to corruption and bias.\nBULLET::::- Policy studies provide general guidance and direction on broad issues by identifying and assessing potential costs and benefits of competing policies. The drawback is these studies can be corrupted or subverted by the politically motivated actions of the participants.\nBULLET::::- Consumer-oriented studies are used to judge the relative merits of goods and services based on generalized needs and values, along with a comprehensive range of effects. However, this approach does not necessarily help practitioners improve their work, and it requires a very good and credible evaluator to do it well.\nBULLET::::- Accreditation / certification programs are based on self-study and peer review of organizations, programs, and personnel. They draw on the insights, experience, and expertise of qualified individuals who use established guidelines to determine if the applicant should be approved to perform specified functions. However, unless performance-based standards are used, attributes of applicants and the processes they perform often are overemphasized in relation to measures of outcomes or effects.\nBULLET::::- Connoisseur studies use the highly refined skills of individuals intimately familiar with the subject of the evaluation to critically characterize and appraise it. This approach can help others see programs in a new light, but it is difficult to find a qualified and unbiased connoisseur.\nBULLET::::- The adversary approach focuses on drawing out the pros and cons of controversial issues through quasi-legal proceedings. This helps ensure a balanced presentation of different perspectives on the issues, but it is also likely to discourage later cooperation and heighten animosities between contesting parties if \"winners\" and \"losers\" emerge.\nBULLET::::- Client-centered studies address specific concerns and issues of practitioners and other clients of the study in a particular setting.

Since stakeholders are such a crucial element to participatory evaluation, a major challenge to this method is ensuring that the right groups have been included in evaluation methods. Further still, the challenge is identifying what practices and data collection methods work best when collaborating with stakeholders, especially when working with multiple stakeholder groups that have clashing values and objectives. Another challenge to implementing participatory evaluation methods is maintaining the balance in power dynamics between different stakeholders of the development project, including the evaluation team itself. As part of project teams, evaluation teams hold an authoritative position and these evaluators have the potential to hold more power than local stakeholders. Ultimately, this power balance can be reflected by skewed results."], "wikipedia-29738569": ["Some perspectives understand ToC as a fixed model that gets in the way of effective work and useful evaluation. However, Patrizi notes that ToC is only at odds with strategic behavior if an organization treats their ToC like any other fixed plan. As Patrizi writes: \u201cOnce assumptions [in a theory of change] are laid out, 1) foundations don't actually test those assumptions, and 2) they don't see using the model as a continuous process. It is, like, \u2018Well, we did our ToC and now we are done\u2019. If the change model is instead treated as something to adjust as organizations learn what works from experience in the field, then the theory should not be at odds with strategic behavior. If strategy is about seizing opportunities and trying out what works, the Theory of Change model serves as a guiding frame of reference. A list is not a model; a list does not push practitioners to consider the goals as part of a systematic model of change, or to think critically\u2014strategically\u2014about how best to attain the outcomes along the pathway.\n\nGiven that things don\u2019t happen in a straight-line sequence \u2013 as things impact each other in multiple, partly unpredictable ways, with all kinds of feedback loops that aren\u2019t modeled in a top-down diagramming format \u2013 an important question is: How adequate is the linear Theory of Change model as a description of what\u2019s going to happen? One answer to the question is that Theory of Change does not, in fact, model how things happen; rather, it models how we believe things will happen. Theory of Change is a forecast that shows what conditions we believe must exist for other conditions to come into being. Because it is forward looking and logical, Theory of Change reflects the way we think logically \u2013that is, if a, then b\u2014and chronologically\u2014first this, then that. The linear format is therefore appropriate. It can be helpful to complement Theory of Change with a process model that shows how the Theory of Change fits into a larger, more cyclical scheme in which theory leads to action, which leads to monitoring and evaluation, which leads to adjustment of the theory, which leads to the next action, more monitoring and evaluation, and so on. Such a process model depicts the linear theory as a conceptual driver of change, which must, to remain useful, be accompanied not only by taking action but also by evaluation and recalibration."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Clinical discretion is advised for all self-report inventories.\n\nAnother issue is the social desirability bias, which can cause over-reporting of socially desirable and under-reporting of socially undesirable behaviors.\n\nMany personality tests, such as the MMPI or the MBTI add questions that are designed to make it difficult for a person to exaggerate traits and symptoms. However, these tests suffer from the inherent problems associated with personality theory and testing, in that personality is a fluid concept that can be difficult to define."], "wikipedia-4144627": ["Self-report studies have validity problems. Patients may exaggerate symptoms in order to make their situation seem worse, or they may under-report the severity or frequency of symptoms in order to minimize their problems. Patients might also simply be mistaken or misremember the material covered by the survey.\n\nHowever participants may not respond truthfully, either because they cannot remember or because they wish to present themselves in a socially acceptable manner. Social desirability bias can be a big problem with self-report measures as participants often answer in a way to portray themselves in a good light. \nQuestions are not always clear and we do not know if the respondent has really understood the question we would not be collecting valid data.\nIf questionnaires are sent out, say via email or through tutor groups, response rate can be very low. \nQuestions can often be leading. That is, they may be unwittingly forcing the respondent to give a particular reply.\n\nSelf-reported answers may be exaggerated; respondents may be too embarrassed to reveal private details; various biases may affect the results, like social desirability bias. There are also cases when respondents guess the hypothesis of the study and provide biased responses that 1) confirm the researcher's conjecture; 2) make them look good; or, 3) make them appear more distressed to receive promised services.\nSubjects may also forget pertinent details. Self-report studies are inherently biased by the person's feelings at the time they filled out the questionnaire. If a person feels bad at the time they fill out the questionnaire, for example, their answers will be more negative. If the person feels good at the time, then the answers will be more positive.\nAs with all studies relying on voluntary participation, results can be biased by a \"lack\" of respondents, if there are systematic differences between people who respond and people who do not. Care must be taken to avoid biases due to interviewers and their demand characteristics."], "wikipedia-22575147": ["Self-reported assessments of sexual behavior are prone to a number of measurement concerns which may affect the reliability and validity of a measure, ranging from a participant's literacy level and comprehension of behavioral terminology to recall biases and self-presentation (or confidentiality concerns resulting from stigmatization of the behavior in question)."], "wikipedia-52578071": ["Self-reporting or observations by a clinician have been the most common instruments used to assess everyday functioning, but these methods have weaknesses.

A modern example is the Serbian language, which is written in either the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet or Gaj's Latin alphabet. Although most speakers can read and write both scripts, Roman Catholic Croatians and Muslim Bosniaks generally use Latin, while Orthodox Serbians commonly use both. However, older indigenous scripts were used much earlier, most notably Bosnian Cyrillic. Inuktitut is also officially digraphic, using both Latin and Inuktitut syllabics. In Hindi-Urdu, the Devanagari or Persian script generally follows the Hindi and Urdu standards and the speaker's religious affiliation, though Urdu is sometimes written in Devanagari in India. Digraphia is limited, however, in that most people know only one script.\n\nThe Japanese writing system has unusually complex digraphia. William C. Hannas distinguishes two digraphic forms of Japanese: \"true digraphia\" of occasionally using \"r\u014dmaji\" Latin alphabet for a few loanwords like \"DVD\", and of regularly using three scripts (technically, \"trigraphia\") for different functions. Japanese is written with \"kanji\" \"Chinese character\" logographs used for Sino-Japanese vocabulary; \"hiragana\" used for native Japanese words; and \"katakana\" used for foreign borrowings or graphic emphasis. Take \"Nihon\" for instance, the primary name of Japan. It is normally written \u65e5\u672c (literally, \"sun's origin\") in \"kanji\" \u2013 but is occasionally written \u306b\u307b\u3093 in \"hiragana\", \u30cb\u30db\u30f3 in \"katakana\", or Nihon in \"r\u014dmaji\" (\"romanization\"). Japanese users having a certain amount of flexibility in choosing between scripts, and their choices can have social meaning.\n\nAnother example is the Malay language, which most often uses the Latin alphabet, while in certain geographic areas (Kelantan state of Malaysia, Brunei) it is also written with an adapted Arabic alphabet called Jawi. Adaptation of Arabic script is also widely used across Malay Archipelago since the introduction of Islam. In Java, Javanese people, which predominantly ruled by Hindu and Buddha kingdoms, have their own writing system called Hanacaraka. When Islamic power took place, modified Arabic writing system (called Pegon) was introduced, alongside with the massive introduction of Latin alphabet by western colonialists. This results in the use of three writing systems to write modern Javanese, either based on a particular context (religious, cultural or normal), or sometimes also written simultaneously.

(Eason, 1988)\nSection::::Time planning.\nIt is very important to have a detailed plan of conducting the new system in an organization (Lee, 2004, Eason, 1988). The most important thing about time planning for a parallel conversion is not to rush things and not be afraid of possible delays in the actual conversion phase. (Lee, 2004). It can be very beneficial also to work with clearly defined milestones (Rooijmans, 2003), similar to the PRINCE2 method. More information on time planning can be found in Planning and Strategic planning.\nSection::::Requirements evaluation.\nThe requirements evaluation involves redefining the implementation script. The IT and (if possible) organizational requirements that were made should be tested. Some tests can be run where the organizational responsibilities can be evaluated (Rooijmans, 2003) as well as the IT-requirements. Here it is also again important to have top-management support and involvement (Eason, 1988). If they do not make resources available to evaluate, the implementation can be unsuccessful as a direct consequence. After this evaluation the implementation script is redefined into a more explicit conversion scenario.\nSection::::Conversion scenario.\nThe conversion scenario thus consists of a blueprint for the organizational change in all aspects. However, there are two topics that did not yet get the attention they deserve in the parallel adoption scope. \nBULLET::::- Workaround strategy / Rollback plan: Being distinct from the other adoption scenarios, also integrated in the conversion scenario is the workaround or contingency strategy with a rollback plan. The workaround strategy is defined in a broader scope in another entry, but in this context it indicates as defined in the above table: A backup plan; strategy taken on, in the conversion scenario to prevent errors in the conversion process and attempt to work around them, so that the implementation can still be successful. (Microsoft, 2004). The rollback plan, as being one possible workaround strategy, is initiated if something goes wrong in the conversion phase. Since the two systems run simultaneously, in a parallel adoption, the rollback plan indicates that the database or other system that handles the transactions should be fully retraceable in the legacy system (Microsoft, 2004). In fact the parallel adoption provides per definition this rollback plan due to its nature of a leading system and a (non-leading) backup system.\nBULLET::::- Criteria indicators: Since the conversion scenario is a blueprint of executing the transfer of the two systems, is also entails quantifiable criteria. The redefined IT and organizational requirements are being transferred into measurable components. When the criteria are not being met in the test conversion, the workaround strategy should be deployed.\nSection::::Conversion.\nThe actual conversion phase is now in place. During this process, the organization is in a stressful period (Eason, 1988, Rooijmans, 2003). The two systems run parallel according to the conversion scenario and the new system is being monitored closely. When the criteria of the new system are met, the old system will cease being the leading system and the new system takes over. The catch ups that are part of the workaround strategy are the back ups of the old system and provide the means for reliability engineering and data recovery. There are two kinds of ways to make catch-ups: automatic catch ups and catch ups by hand. (Rooijmans, 2003). If applicable a remote backup service can be deployed as well.\nSection::::Control system.\nBULLET::::- Automatic catch ups: Catch ups that are being transferred by an automated system, created in the preparing the organization phase. This system automatically transfers the data or information to the new system when the conversion goes from the old leading system to the new leading system. The benefit of an automated system is that it is fast and accurate. The disadvantage is that is takes time to produce a transfer system in an earlier stage.\nBULLET::::- Catch ups by hand: When the actual conversion entails only a small amount of time, or the complexity of information that should be transferred to the new system is small, an organization can choose to transfer the catch ups manually. The advantage of this procedure is that there is no need for a system (software program) to transfer the information and the possible problems that come with such kind of a transfer-program. The trade-off is accuracy and time. It takes a considerable amount of extra time, to transfer the catch ups manually and it is more vulnerable for small human errors (Rooijmans, 2003). Moreover, the additional investment in labour hours is high already; a manual catch up system places even more pressure on the personnel.\nSection::::Evaluation / Practical relevance.\nThere are several lessons that can be learned from case studies: The Nevada DMV system case, described by Lee (2004), learns that an implementation to a new process can also have a political implication. When the system that will be changed affects the general public and it is not only an internal system that is being changed, there are some more pressures that influence the organization. In this case, concepts as company image and reputation can drastically change if customers are faced with more delays in for example communication or ordering goods. It is suggested that if the system is politically sensitive, more attention should be paid to the conversion method and preferably parallel adoption is opted, since there is less risk involved.br\nbr\nA series of lessons learned from a number of actual case scenario\u2019s implementing a new portfolio system, performed by a business-consultancy firm (Venture, 2004) show some interesting lessons learned from the field. they seem to fit perfectly with the issues mentioned for a generic parallel adoption process, based on a combination of scientific work. To summarise:\nBULLET::::- Risk assessment and contingency (workaround) planning is very important\nBULLET::::- Assign project team roles\nBULLET::::- Construct specific milestones (like PRINCE2) that include training and testing plans\nBULLET::::- Identify potential risks and execute your contingency plan when necessary\nBULLET::::- Communicate project status\nBULLET::::- Changes should be appropriately authorized\nBULLET::::- The conversion strategy needs to carefully examine the data requirements\nBULLET::::- New and changed data should be tested against validation rules\nBULLET::::- Construct a thorough rollback plan\nBULLET::::- When possible, negotiate a pilot conversion\nThere are also at least two difficulties with parallel conversion that may make its use impractical in the 21st century, though it was a staple of industry practice when inputs consisted of decks of punched cards or reels of tape. These are:\n1. It is impractical to expect end users, be they customers, production line workers or nearly anyone else, to enter every transaction twice via different interfaces.\n2. Timing differences between two multi-user interactive systems can properly produce different results even when both systems are operating correctly, are internally consistent, and could be used successfully by themselves.\nAs a result, parallel conversion is restricted to a few specific situations today, such as accounting systems where absolute verifiability of results is mandatory, where users are all internal to the organization and understand this requirement, and where the order of activities cannot be allowed to affect the output. In practice, the pilot and phased conversion methods are more relevant today."], "wikipedia-23992863": ["Rock-paper-scissors, a widely played hand game, is an example of a simultaneous game.

Because industrial productivity is no longer gated by scarce human labor, the value of land skyrockets compared to the price of goods; even remaining \"Luddite\" humans who owned or inherited land should be able to sell or lease a small piece of it to the more-productive robots in exchange for a perpetual annuity sufficient to easily indefinitely meet all of their basic financial needs. Such people can live as long as they choose to, and are free to engage in almost any activity they can conceive of, for pleasure or for self-actualization, without financial concern. Advanced technologies enable entirely new modes of thought and experience, thus adding to the palette of possible feelings. People in the future may even experience never-ending \"gradients of bliss\".\n\nSection::::AI aftermath scenarios.:Benevolent dictator.\nIn this scenario, postulate that a superintelligent artificial intelligence takes control of society, but acts in a beneficial way. Its programmers, despite being on a deadline, solved quasi-philosophical problems that had seemed to some intractable, and created an AI with the following goal: to use its superintelligence to figure out what human utopia looks like by analyzing human behavior, human brains, and human genes; and then, to implement that utopia. The AI arrives at a subtle and complex definition of human flourishing. Valuing diversity, and recognizing that different people have different preferences, the AI divides Earth into different sectors. Harming others, making weapons, evading surveillance, or trying to create a rival superintelligence are globally banned; apart from that, each sector is free to make its own laws; for example, a religious person might choose to live in the \"pious sector\" corresponding to his religion, where the appropriate religious rules are strictly enforced. In all sectors, disease, poverty, crime, hangovers, addiction, and all other involuntary suffering have been eliminated. Many sectors boast advanced architecture and spectacle that \"make typical sci-fi visions pale in comparison\". Life is an \"all-inclusive pleasure cruise\", as if it were \"Christmas 365 days a year\".\n\nSection::::AI aftermath scenarios.:Gatekeeper AI.\nIn \"Gatekeeper\" AI scenarios, the AI can act to prevent rival superintelligences from being created, but otherwise errs on the side of allowing humans to create their own destiny. Ben Goertzel of OpenCog has advocated a \"Nanny AI\" scenario where the AI additionally takes some responsibility for preventing humans from destroying themselves, for example by slowing down technological progress to give time for society to advance in a more thoughtful and deliberate manner. In a third scenario, a superintelligent \"Protector\" AI gives humans the illusion of control, by hiding or erasing all knowledge of its existence, but works behind the scenes to guarantee positive outcomes. In all three scenarios, while humanity gains more control (or at least the illusion of control), humanity ends up progressing more slowly than it would if the AI were unrestricted in its willingness to rain down all the benefits of its advanced technology on the human race.\n\nSection::::AI aftermath scenarios.:Boxed AI.\nThe AI Box scenario postulates that a superintelligent AI can be \"confined to a box\" and its actions can be restricted by human gatekeepers; the humans in charge would try to take advantage of some of the AI's scientific breakthroughs or reasoning abilities, without allowing the AI to take over the world. Successful gatekeeping may be difficult; the more intelligent the AI is, the more likely the AI can find a clever way to use \"social hacking\" and convince the gatekeepers to let it escape, or even to find an unforeseen physical method of escape.\n\nSection::::AI aftermath scenarios.:Human-AI merger.\nKurzweil argues that in the future \"There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality\".\n\nSection::::AI aftermath scenarios.:Human extinction.\nIf a dominant superintelligent machine were to conclude that human survival is an unnecessary risk or a waste of resources, the result would be human extinction. This could occur if a machine, programmed without respect for human values, unexpectedly gains superintelligence through recursive self-improvement, or manages to escape from its containment in an AI Box scenario. This could also occur if the first superintelligent AI was programmed with an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of human values, either because the task of instilling the AI with human values was too difficult or impossible; due to a buggy initial implementation of the AI; or due to bugs accidentally being introduced, either by its human programmers or by the self-improving AI itself, in the course of refining its code base. Bostrom and others argue that human extinction is probably the \"default path\" that society is currently taking, in the absence of substantial preparatory attention to AI safety.

From the 1980s, the Mongolian script was reintroduced into schools for its historical and cultural importance.\nBULLET::::2. \"To distance themselves from a group.\" In the mid-19th century, the LDS Church developed and promoted the Deseret alphabet for English. Brigham Young publicly claimed it was more phonetically accurate than Latin script and would facilitate learning to read and write English. However, historian David Bigler says the Deseret alphabet \"demonstrated cultural exclusivism, an important consideration. It also kept secrets from curious non-Mormons, [and] controlled what children would be allowed to read.\"\nBULLET::::3. Participation in developments on a broader scale. The choice of a script can influence a group's preparedness to interact with other regional or international groups. For instance, the Hmong language has numerous alternate writing systems. Hmong who live in Southeast Asia prefer the indigenous Romanized Popular Alphabet (RPA) or the Pahawh Hmong semi-syllabary; Hmong expatriates who live in the United States prefer to romanize names differently, such as Latin \"Hmong\" instead of RPA \"Hmoob\".\nBULLET::::4. \"Linguistic considerations.\" Sometimes a foreign script is rejected because it is unsuitable for the phonetics of a language. Korean was first written in logographic \"Hanja\" Chinese characters, but king Sejong the Great promulgated the Hangul alphabet, which is better suited for transcribing Korean phonology. In the present day, South Korean uses both \"Hanja\" logographs and \"Hangul\" letters, while North Korea uses only \"Hangul\".\n\n\"Synchronic digraphia\" is the coexistence of two or more writing systems for the same language. A modern example is the Serbian language, which is written in either the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet or Gaj's Latin alphabet. Although most speakers can read and write both scripts, Roman Catholic Croatians and Muslim Bosniaks generally use Latin, while Orthodox Serbians commonly use both. However, older indigenous scripts were used much earlier, most notably Bosnian Cyrillic. Inuktitut is also officially digraphic, using both Latin and Inuktitut syllabics. In Hindi-Urdu, the Devanagari or Persian script generally follows the Hindi and Urdu standards and the speaker's religious affiliation, though Urdu is sometimes written in Devanagari in India. Digraphia is limited, however, in that most people know only one script.\n\nThe Japanese writing system has unusually complex digraphia. William C. Hannas distinguishes two digraphic forms of Japanese: \"true digraphia\" of occasionally using \"r\u014dmaji\" Latin alphabet for a few loanwords like \"DVD\", and of regularly using three scripts (technically, \"trigraphia\") for different functions. Japanese is written with \"kanji\" \"Chinese character\" logographs used for Sino-Japanese vocabulary; \"hiragana\" used for native Japanese words; and \"katakana\" used for foreign borrowings or graphic emphasis. Take \"Nihon\" for instance, the primary name of Japan. It is normally written \u65e5\u672c (literally, \"sun's origin\") in \"kanji\" \u2013 but is occasionally written \u306b\u307b\u3093 in \"hiragana\", \u30cb\u30db\u30f3 in \"katakana\", or Nihon in \"r\u014dmaji\" (\"romanization\"). Japanese users having a certain amount of flexibility in choosing between scripts, and their choices can have social meaning.\n\nAnother example is the Malay language, which most often uses the Latin alphabet, while in certain geographic areas (Kelantan state of Malaysia, Brunei) it is also written with an adapted Arabic alphabet called Jawi. Adaptation of Arabic script is also widely used across Malay Archipelago since the introduction of Islam. In Java, Javanese people, which predominantly ruled by Hindu and Buddha kingdoms, have their own writing system called Hanacaraka. When Islamic power took place, modified Arabic writing system (called Pegon) was introduced, alongside with the massive introduction of Latin alphabet by western colonialists. This results in the use of three writing systems to write modern Javanese, either based on a particular context (religious, cultural or normal), or sometimes also written simultaneously. This phenomenon also occurred in some other cultures in Indonesia.", "DeFrancis notes, \"The old literature in the earlier scripts remains, however, so that all these scripts more or less overlap in use, by scholars involved with early texts, or for reprinting earlier materials for a wider readership and for other limited uses.\""], "wikipedia-2965801": ["Possibly the most well-known is JBehave, which was developed by Dan North, Elizabeth Keogh and several others. The following is an example taken from that project:\nConsider an implementation of the Game of Life. A domain expert (or business analyst) might want to specify what should happen when someone is setting up a starting configuration of the game grid. To do this, he might want to give an example of a number of steps taken by a person who is toggling cells. Skipping over the narrative part, he might do this by writing up the following scenario into a plain text document (which is the type of input document that JBehave reads):\nThe bold print is not part of the input; it is included here to show which words are recognized as formal language. JBehave recognizes the terms \"Given\" (as a precondition which defines the start of a scenario), \"When\" (as an event trigger) and \"Then\" (as a postcondition which must be verified as the outcome of the action that follows the trigger). Based on this, JBehave is capable of reading the text file containing the scenario and parsing it into clauses (a set-up clause and then three event triggers with verifiable conditions). JBehave then takes these clauses and passes them on to code that is capable of setting a test, responding to the event triggers and verifying the outcome. This code must be written by the developers in the project team (in Java, because that is the platform JBehave is based on). In this case, the code might look like this:\nprivate Game game;\nprivate StringRenderer renderer;\n@Given(\"a $width by $height game\")\npublic void theGameIsRunning(int width, int height) {\n@When(\"I toggle the cell at ($column, $row)\")\npublic void iToggleTheCellAt(int column, int row) {\n@Then(\"the grid should look like $grid\")\npublic void theGridShouldLookLike(String grid) {\nThe code has a method for every type of clause in a scenario. JBehave will identify which method goes with which clause through the use of annotations and will call each method in order while running through the scenario. The text in each clause in the scenario is expected to match the template text given in the code for that clause (for example, a Given in a scenario is expected to be followed by a clause of the form \"a X by Y game\"). JBehave supports the matching of clauses to templates and has built-in support for picking terms out of the template and passing them to methods in the test code as parameters. The test code provides an implementation for each clause type in a scenario which interacts with the code that is being tested and performs a test based on the scenario. In this case:\nBULLET::::- The codice_1 method reacts to a Given clause by setting up the initial game grid.\nBULLET::::- The codice_2 method reacts to a When clause by firing off the toggle event described in the clause.\nBULLET::::- The codice_3 method reacts to a Then clause by comparing the state of the game grid to the expected state from the scenario.\nThe primary function of this code is to be a bridge between a text file with a story and the code being tested. Note that the test code has access to the code being tested (in this case an instance of codice_4) and is very simple in nature. The test code has to be simple, otherwise a developer would end up having to write tests for his tests.\nFinally, in order to run the tests, JBehave requires some plumbing code that identifies the text files which contain scenarios and which inject dependencies (like instances of codice_4) into the test code. This plumbing code is not illustrated here, since it is a technical requirement of JBehave and does not relate directly to the principle of BDD-style testing."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Through play children can develop social and cognitive skills, mature emotionally, and gain the self-confidence required to engage in new experiences and environments.\nKey ways that young children learn include playing, being with other people, being active, exploring and new experiences, talking to themselves, communication with others, meeting physical and mental challenges, being shown how to do new things, practicing and repeating skills and having fun.\nAccording to proponents of the concept, play enables children to make sense of their world. Children possess a natural curiosity to explore and play acts as a medium to do so. In the book \"Einstein Never Used Flash Cards\", five elements of children's play are listed: \nBULLET::::- Play must be pleasurable and enjoyable.\nBULLET::::- Play must have no extrinsic goals; there is no prescribed learning that must occur.\nBULLET::::- Play is spontaneous and voluntary.\nBULLET::::- Play involves active engagement on the part of the player.\nBULLET::::- Play involves an element of make-believe.\nSeven common characteristics of play are listed in \"Playing and Learning\", by Beverlie Dietze and Diane Kashin: Play is active, child-initiated, process oriented, intrinsic, episodic, rule-governed, and symbolic.\nModern theories examine play from the perspective of how it impacts a child's development. According to Dietze and Kashin, \u201cThe learner is no longer regarded as a passive receiver of knowledge, but as an active constructor of meaning\u201d. This perspective is emphasized within the constructionist theory through experiential learning. Theorist John Dewey suggests that children learn best by both physical and intellectual activity; in other words, children need to take an active role in play.\nContemporary theories focus on the relationship of play to diversity and social justice in daily living and knowledge. Children learn social and cultural contexts through their daily living experiences. The Zone of Proximal Development concept, developed by Lev Vygotsky, suggests that children require activities that support past learning and encourage new learning at a slightly-more-difficult level. Vygotsky believed that social engagement and collaboration with others are powerful forces which transform children's thinking. Urie Bronfenbrenner states that a child's development is influenced by both the person and the environment (which includes family, community, culture and the broader society).\nPlay is sufficiently important to the United Nations that it has recognized it as a specific right for all children. Children need the freedom to explore and play. Play also contributes to brain development. Evidence from neuroscience shows that the early years of a child's development (from birth to age six) set the basis for learning, behavior and health throughout life. A child's neural pathways are influenced in their development through the exploration, thinking, problem-solving and language expression which occur during play episodes. According to the Canadian Council on Learning, \"Play nourishes every aspect of children\u2019s development \u2013 it forms the foundation of intellectual, social, physical, and emotional skills necessary for success in school and in life. Play 'paves the way for learning'\u201d.\nLearning occurs when children play with blocks, paint a picture or play make-believe. During play children try new things, solve problems, invent, create, test ideas and explore.", "It has been acknowledged that there is a strong link between play and learning for young children, especially in the areas of problem solving, language acquisition, literacy, numeracy and social, physical, and emotional skills. Young children actively explore their environment and the world around them through learning-based play. Play is a vital part of a child's optimal social, cognitive, physical and emotional development. Researchers agree that play provides a strong foundation for intellectual growth, creativity, problem-solving and basic academic knowledge. According to Dorothy Singer, \u201cThrough make-believe games children can be anyone they wish and go anywhere they want. When they engage in sociodramatic play, they learn how to cope with feelings, how to bring the large, confusing world into a small, manageable size; and how to become socially adept as they share, take turns and cooperate with each other. When children play, they are learning new words, how to problem solve, and how to be flexible\u201d. As children learn through purposeful, quality play experience, they build critical basic skills for cognitive development and academic achievement. These include verbalization, language comprehension, vocabulary, imagination, questioning, problem-solving, observation, empathy, co-operation skills and the perspectives of others. Through play, children learn a set of skills: social skills, creativity, hand-eye coordination, problem solving and imagination. It is argued that these skills are better learned through play than through flashcards or academic drills."], "wikipedia-10332": ["Educational psychology research on motivation is concerned with the volition or will that students bring to a task, their level of interest and intrinsic motivation, the personally held goals that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure. As intrinsic motivation deals with activities that act as their own rewards, extrinsic motivation deals with motivations that are brought on by consequences or punishments. A form of attribution theory developed by Bernard Weiner describes how students' beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions of shame and embarrassment and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.\nThe self-determination theory (SDT) was developed by psychologists Edward Deci and Richard Ryan. SDT focuses on the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in driving human behavior and posits inherent growth and development tendencies. It emphasizes the degree to which an individual's behavior is self-motivated and self-determined. When applied to the realm of education, the self-determination theory is concerned primarily with promoting in students an interest in learning, a value of education, and a confidence in their own capacities and attributes.\nMotivational theories also explain how learners' goals affect the way they engage with academic tasks. Those who have \"mastery goals\" strive to increase their ability and knowledge. Those who have \"performance approach goals\" strive for high grades and seek opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Those who have \"performance avoidance\" goals are driven by fear of failure and avoid situations where their abilities are exposed. Research has found that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes such as persistence in the face of failure, preference for challenging tasks, creativity and intrinsic motivation. Performance avoidance goals are associated with negative outcomes such as poor concentration while studying, disorganized studying, less self-regulation, shallow information processing and test anxiety. Performance approach goals are associated with positive outcomes, and some negative outcomes such as an unwillingness to seek help and shallow information processing."], "wikipedia-183403": ["Play, as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child's learning and development. Through play, children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration. Children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger, through play activities. As a form of learning, play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children."], "wikipedia-14069848": ["The principle of effect is based on the emotional reaction of the student. It has a direct relationship to motivation. The principle of effect is that learning is strengthened when accompanied by a pleasant or satisfying feeling, and that learning is weakened when associated with an unpleasant feeling. The student will strive to continue doing what provides a pleasant effect to continue learning. Positive reinforcement is more apt to lead to success and motivate the learner, so the instructor should recognize and commend improvement. Whatever the learning situation, it should contain elements that affect the students positively and give them a feeling of satisfaction. Therefore, instructors should be cautious about using punishment in the classroom.\nOne of the important obligations of the instructor is to set up the learning situation in such a manner that each trainee will be able to see evidence of progress and achieve some degree of success. Experiences that produce feelings of defeat, frustration, anger, confusion, or futility are unpleasant for the student. If, for example, an instructor attempts to teach advanced concepts on the initial engagement, the student is likely to feel inferior and be frustrated. Impressing upon students the difficulty of a task to be learned can make the teaching task difficult. Usually it is better to tell students that a problem or task, although difficult, is within their capability to understand or perform. Every learning experience does not have to be entirely successful, nor does the student have to master each lesson completely. However, every learning experience should contain elements that leave the student with some good feelings. A student\u2019s chance of success is definitely increased if the learning experience is a pleasant one."], "wikipedia-42976376": ["Another crucial component of child development deals with the initiative and self-induced motivation of the learners (or children) themselves.Their eagerness to contribute, ability to execute roles, and search for a sense of belonging helps mold them into valued members of both their families and communities alike. The value placed on \u201cshared work\u201d or help emphasizes how learning and even motivation is related to the way the children participate and contribute to their family and community. One of the motivational factors that contribute to Indigenous children\u2019s learning stems from \u201cinherent motivation\u201d where the child feels a sense of accomplishment or contentment in helping their family or community because the contribution emphasizes their roles and value in their community.\nIndigenous children take pride in their contributions to the community. When they contribute to their household, children are able to see the value and importance of their work as it helps maintain their family\u2019s well being. The children are motivated to observe and learn because they are aware that they are making an important contribution to the family or community; they feel pride and a sense of self-worth as they help provide for their younger siblings, family and community. Through such \u201cinherent motivation,\u201d children are expected to learn community practices in order to become valuable contributors in the community. In addition, an authentic or natural setting could be considered just as important in children\u2019s learning as a teacher. This is because Indigenous children learn many of their skills from observing their surroundings and participating in activities with their peers and other members of the community."], "wikipedia-313565": ["Learning, for instance, takes place when the student gives attention towards the teacher. Interest and effort closely relate to attention. Attention is an active process which involves numerous outside stimuli. The attention of an organism at any point in time involves three concentric circles; beyond awareness, margin, and focus.\n\nA theory of cognitive development called information processing holds that memory and attention are the foundation of cognition. It is suggested that children's attention are initially selective and is based on situations that are important to their goals. This capacity increases as the child grows older since they more able to absorb stimuli from tasks. Another conceptualization classified attention into mental attention and perceptual attention. The former is described as the executive-driven attentional \"brain energy\" that activates task-relevant processes in the brain while the latter are immediate or spontaneous attention driven by novel perceptual experiences.\n\nCognitive theory mainly stresses the acquisition of knowledge and growth of the mental structure. Cognitive theory tends to focus on conceptualizing the student's learning process: how information is received; how information is processed and organized into existing schema; how information is retrieved upon recall. In other words, cognitive theory seeks to explain the process of knowledge acquisition and the subsequent effects on the mental structures within the mind. Learning is not about the mechanics of what a learner does, but rather a process depending on what the learner already knows (existing information) and their method of acquiring new knowledge (how they integrate new information into their existing schemas). Knowledge acquisition is an activity consisting of internal codification of mental structures within the student's mind. Inherent to the theory, the student must be an active participant in their own learning process. Cognitive approaches mainly focus on the mental activities of the learner like mental planning, goal setting, and organizational strategies (Shell, 1980).\n\nIn cognitive theories not only the environmental factors and instructional components play an important role in learning. There are additional key elements like learning to code, transform, rehearse, and store and retrieve the information. Learning process includes learner\u2019s thoughts, beliefs, and attitude values(Winna, 1988)."], "wikipedia-30887751": ["Affective factors relate to the learner's emotional state and attitude toward the target language. Research on affect in language learning is still strongly influenced by Bloom's taxonomy, which describes the affective levels of receiving, responding, valuing, organization, and self-characterization through one's value system. It has also been informed in recent years by research in neurobiology and neurolinguistics. A research study conducted by Ni (2012), was interested in the role that affective factors played in second-language acquisition (SLA).Additionally, she wanted to know how to apply this knowledge to the context of an educational setting. For example, many instructors want to create lessons for students that facilitate the process of learning a new foreign language. The study Ni (2012) conducted sought to find what important skills students could implement in their SLA pursuits. A 10-item questionnaire was administered to 50 students enrolled in the Foreign Language Department at Heze University in China. The questions collected data on participants\u2019 English fluency, affective factors influence in their SLA, and the preferred method of feedback from their instructor. The main findings displayed how affective factors (e.g. motivation, self-confidence, and anxiety) may advance the acquisition of English as a second language. By using this knowledge, teachers can strengthen their students\u2019 emotional states and create a more welcoming class environment. In doing so, students may be able to acquire a second language more effectively.", "Anxiety.\nAlthough some continue to propose that a low level of anxiety may be helpful, studies have almost unanimously shown that anxiety damages students' prospects for successful learning. Anxiety is often related to a sense of threat to the learner's self-concept in the learning situation, for example if a learner fears being ridiculed for a mistake.\n\nPersonality factors.\nStudies have shown that extroverts acquire a second language better than introverts.\n\nMotivation.\nThe role of motivation in SLA has been the subject of extensive scholarship, closely influenced by work in motivational psychology. Motivation is internally complex, and D\u00f6rnyei begins his work by stating that \"strictly speaking, \"there is no such thing as motivation.\"\" There are many different kinds of motivation; these are often divided into types such as integrative or instrumental, intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation refers to the desire to do something for an internal reward. Most studies have shown it to be substantially more effective in long-term language learning than extrinsic motivation, for an external reward such as high grades or praise. Integrative and instrumental orientations refer to the degree that a language is learned \"for its own sake\" (integratively) or for instrumental purposes. Studies have not consistently shown either form of motivation to be more effective than the other, and the role of each is probably conditioned by various personality and cultural factors.\nSome research has shown that motivation correlates strongly with proficiency, indicating both that successful learners are motivated and that success improves motivation. Thus motivation is not fixed, but is strongly affected by feedback from the environment."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a taxonomy for human facial movements as they appear on the face. Movements of individual facial muscles are encoded by FACS from slight instant changes in facial appearance. Using FACS it is possible to code nearly any anatomically possible emotion, deconstructing it into the specific AU that produced the facial expression. FACS is an established scheme for coding facial expressions, which is supported by multiple studies that have evaluated FACS with positive results with adults [11, 41]. Additionally, studies used the scheme in the previous years with children with positive results as well [35, 36]. Furthermore, it is a common standard to objectively describe emotions from facial expressions using such techniques [56]. Figure 4 shows the AUs detected for this paper and Table 1 shows how to define emotions from the AUs. In this paper, we are using the proportion of each emotion during the coding activity.

Depending on the process of interest, different data streams may be more appropriate. Some of these data streams currently used within education include video, system logs, and physiological response data such as, electrodermal activity, heart rate variability, blood volume pulse, and skin temperature.

By combining these we extended our current body of knowledge by adding a new, physiological level of understanding of learning procedures. One can argue that the two measurements are not exactly the same, which is evident by the results reported in the paper. We have shown that there is a significant overlap between the retrospective measurement of fun (through questionnaire) and the spontaneous measurement of affect (through sensor data). Both measurements have been evaluated separately [11, 41, 53]. This study is an attempt to find a relationship between the two measurements to have more real-time information about the semantic beliefs and memories using the sensor data. Accordingly, we found that RLG and most of the FunQ dimensions can be explained by the CVT affective states (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and the transition between these). Therefore, the introduced results indicate that there is a link between learners\u2019 affective states, their learning outcomes, and the fun they have experienced while learning.\n\nMore specifically, regarding students\u2019 learning and their affective states during coding activity (RQ1), we found that sadness, anger, and stress contribute negatively on students\u2019 learning, while arousal positively on it.

The origins of rubrics can be traced to early attempts in education to standardize and scale writing in the early 20th century. Ernest C Noyes argues in November 1912 for a shift toward assessment practices that were more science-based. One of the original scales used in education was developed by Milo B. Hillegas in \"A Scale for the Measurement of Quality in English Composition by Young People\". This scale is commonly referred to as the Hillegas Scale. The Hillegas Scale and other scales used in education were used by administrators to compare the progress of schools.\n\nIn 1961, Diederich, French, and Carlton from the Educational Testing Service (ETS) publish Factors in Judgments for Writing Ability a rubric compiled from a series of raters whose comments were categorized and condensed into a five-factor rubric:\nBULLET::::- \"Ideas\": relevance, clarity, quantity, development, persuasiveness\nBULLET::::- \"Form\": Organization and analysis\nBULLET::::- \"Flavor\": style, interest, sincerity\nBULLET::::- \"Mechanics\": specific errors in punctuation, grammar, etc.\nBULLET::::- \"Wording\": choice and arrangement of words\n\nMultiple-choice tests contain questions about usage, grammar, and vocabulary.

Using FACS it is possible to code nearly any anatomically possible emotion, deconstructing it into the specific AU that produced the facial expression. FACS is an established scheme for coding facial expressions, which is supported by multiple studies that have evaluated FACS with positive results with adults [11, 41].

We collected data from a questionnaire, and physiological response data collected by wristbands and facial video recordings. Using data from different modalities and analyzing them we provide a novel approach as earlier research has been limited to either the investigation of affective states (e.g., by interviews or surveys (e.g., [52]) or physiological measures (e.g., [45]). By combining these we extended our current body of knowledge by adding a new, physiological level of understanding of learning procedures. One can argue that the two measurements are not exactly the same, which is evident by the results reported in the paper. We have shown that there is a significant overlap between the retrospective measurement of fun (through questionnaire) and the spontaneous measurement of affect (through sensor data). Both measurements have been evaluated separately [11, 41, 53]. This study is an attempt to find a relationship between the two measurements to have more real-time information about the semantic beliefs and memories using the sensor data. Accordingly, we found that RLG and most of the FunQ dimensions can be explained by the CVT affective states (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and the transition between these). Therefore, the introduced results indicate that there is a link between learners\u2019 affective states, their learning outcomes, and the fun they have experienced while learning.\n\nMore specifically, regarding students\u2019 learning and their affective states during coding activity (RQ1), we found that sadness, anger, and stress contribute negatively on students\u2019 learning, while arousal positively on it. This finding is in line with previous research that has investigated this relationship with traditional methods (i.e. questionnaires and observations) [29]. However, it also goes beyond those by applying MMLA and physiological measures.\n\nOur research results indicate that from physiological data we could not predict the level of fun - measured as the total score on FunQ \u2013 that children experienced while learning to code. Nevertheless, we found that the total FunQ score significantly correlates with the RLG (Pearson correlation = 0.33, p < 0.05).

The six dimensions are Autonomy (perceived control over participation and the activity itself), Challenge (experienced challenge), Delight (perceived positive emotions and related desires), Immersion (perceived loss of time and space), Loss of Social Barriers (perceived social connectivity), and Stress (perceived negative emotions)."], "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/9": ["Sim et al [46] investigated fun, usability and learning in an educational software with seven and eight year-old children and found no correlation between learning (measured by the difference between the post- and pre-test scores) and fun or between fun and usability. In line with their findings, Iten and Petko [ 22] studying a serious game with child participants aged between 10 to 13 also found no significant relationship between fun and learning (perceived learning and measured learning calculated as the summary score for the current answers for the pre- and post-test). Contrasting these earlier findings, Tisza, Zhu and Markopoulos [55] found when investigating a serious game with 14-15 years old students that having fun while learning had a significant effect on students\u2019 perceived learning, but not on their measured learning (when considering their pre and post outcomes). Lucardie [31] investigating fun and enjoyment in adults\u2019 learning found that both learners and their teachers perceived fun as a motivator to attend classes, and as a contributor to learning knowledge and new skills. Related to coding, Long [30] studying the influence of a programming game on learners\u2019 (mostly adults) programming skills and knowledge found that about 80% of the study participants reported a perceived increase. They also found that 87.5% of the study participants joined because of the anticipated fun of the learning game, making fun a strong motivator for participation. Therefore, having an enjoyable or amusing time (i.e. fun) while learning is a significant predictor for the learning effort. Saez-Lopez et al [40] found in a two-year long study that using Scratch - a block-based visual programming interface - to teach programming to primary school children significantly increased students\u2019 knowledge; furthermore, students reported on having fun while learning with Scratch, a finding that is also supported by the observers\u2019 reports. However, that study did not examine the relationship between fun and learning. Complementary to this, Tisza and Markopoulos [52] found that having fun while learning to program contributed significantly to the perceived learning of primary school children. As it is seen, there is a variety in earlier research in terms of the assessment of learning. While some examined perceived learning [30, 31, 52], others investigated measured learning (i.e., pre-post tests) [40, 46, 55]. To our best knowledge, there are only a few studies that report on the relationship between fun and both the perceived and the measured learning [22, 54, 55]. All of those studies report on regression analyses, indicating a slight difference between the two measures, however, without directly comparing them. Accordingly, understanding the relationship between the perceived and the measured learning, especially in reflection of the experienced fun while learning remains a topic to be addressed by future research. In sum, while earlier research appeared to be inconclusive on the role that fun plays on learning, recent empirical research results are supportive that fun contributes positively to the learning outcomes. This shift is proposed to be due to a better understanding of the notion of fun and accordingly, improved ways for the assessment of it."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-46433": 1, "wikipedia-42057983": 1, "wikipedia-746939": 1, "wikipedia-29100218": 1, "wikipedia-239414": 1, "wikipedia-11040001": 1, "wikipedia-768817": 1, "wikipedia-26868914": 1, "wikipedia-322337": 1, "wikipedia-23689073": 1, "arxiv-2209.02308": 1, "arxiv-1911.01864": 1, "arxiv-1606.07092": 1, "arxiv-1511.09007": 1, "arxiv-2012.03083": 1, "arxiv-1507.03683": 1, "arxiv-1510.00509": 1, "arxiv-2411.03213": 1, "arxiv-1305.2609": 1, "arxiv-2203.00501": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/0": 3, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/2": 2, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/17": 2, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/9": 2, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/37": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/33": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/11": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-46433": 1, "wikipedia-42057983": 1, "wikipedia-746939": 1, "wikipedia-29100218": 1, "wikipedia-239414": 1, "wikipedia-11040001": 1, "wikipedia-768817": 1, "wikipedia-26868914": 1, "wikipedia-322337": 1, "wikipedia-23689073": 1, "arxiv-2209.02308": 1, "arxiv-1911.01864": 1, "arxiv-1606.07092": 1, "arxiv-1511.09007": 1, "arxiv-2012.03083": 1, "arxiv-1507.03683": 1, "arxiv-1510.00509": 1, "arxiv-2411.03213": 1, "arxiv-1305.2609": 1, "arxiv-2203.00501": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/0": 3, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/2": 3, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/17": 3, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/9": 3, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/37": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/33": 2, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/11": 1}}}

This table shows only the significant terms (p < 0.05).\n\n5 DISCUSSION\nIn this study we set out to investigate the relationship between children\u2019s coding learning, the experienced fun, and their physio-affective states during a coding activity. We collected data from a questionnaire, and physiological response data collected by wristbands and facial video recordings. Using data from different modalities and analyzing them we provide a novel approach as earlier research has been limited to either the investigation of affective states (e.g., by interviews or surveys (e.g., [ 52]) or physiological measures (e.g., [ 45]). By combining these we extended our current body of knowledge by adding a new, physiological level of understanding of learning procedures. One can argue that the two measurements are not exactly the same, which is evident by the results reported in the paper. We have shown that there is a significant overlap between the retrospective measurement of fun (through questionnaire) and the spontaneous measurement of affect (through sensor data). Both measurements have been evaluated separately [11, 41, 53]. This study is an attempt to find a relationship between the two measurements to have more real-time information about the semantic beliefs and memories using the sensor data. Accordingly, we found that RLG and most of the FunQ dimensions can be explained by the CVT affective states (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and the transition between these). Therefore, the introduced results indicate that there is a link between learners\u2019 affective states, their learning outcomes, and the fun they have experienced while learning.\n\nOur research results indicate that from physiological data we could not predict the level of fun - measured as the total score on FunQ \u2013 that children experienced while learning to code. Nevertheless, we found that the total FunQ score significantly correlates with the RLG (Pearson correlation = 0.33, p < 0.05). This finding is in line with earlier research, which suggests that having fun while learning contributes to the learning outcomes [30, 31, 40, 52, 55]. Although some dimensions of fun could be predicted from the physio-affective states of the child, we found that the"], "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/51": ["Table 13: Model for the FunQ Stress using the affective states, the transitions among them and the physiological measurements.

We collected data from a questionnaire, and physiological response data collected by wristbands and facial video recordings. Using data from different modalities and analyzing them we provide a novel approach as earlier research has been limited to either the investigation of affective states (e.g., by interviews or surveys (e.g., [ 52]) or physiological measures (e.g., [ 45]). By combining these we extended our current body of knowledge by adding a new, physiological level of understanding of learning procedures. One can argue that the two measurements are not exactly the same, which is evident by the results reported in the paper. We have shown that there is a significant overlap between the retrospective measurement of fun (through questionnaire) and the spontaneous measurement of affect (through sensor data). Both measurements have been evaluated separately [11, 41, 53]. This study is an attempt to find a relationship between the two measurements to have more real-time information about the semantic beliefs and memories using the sensor data. Accordingly, we found that RLG and most of the FunQ dimensions can be explained by the CVT affective states (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and the transition between these). Therefore, the introduced results indicate that there is a link between learners\u2019 affective states, their learning outcomes, and the fun they have experienced while learning.\n\nMore specifically, regarding students\u2019 learning and their affective states during coding activity (RQ1), we found that sadness, anger, and stress contribute negatively on students\u2019 learning, while arousal positively on it.

In line with their findings, Iten and Petko [ 22] studying a serious game with child participants aged between 10 to 13 also found no significant relationship between fun and learning (perceived learning and measured learning calculated as the summary score for the current answers for the pre- and post-test). Contrasting these earlier findings, Tisza, Zhu and Markopoulos [55] found when investigating a serious game with 14-15 years old students that having fun while learning had a significant effect on students\u2019 perceived learning, but not on their measured learning (when considering their pre and post outcomes). Lucardie [31] investigating fun and enjoyment in adults\u2019 learning found that both learners and their teachers perceived fun as a motivator to attend classes, and as a contributor to learning knowledge and new skills. Related to coding, Long [30] studying the influence of a programming game on learners\u2019 (mostly adults) programming skills and knowledge found that about 80% of the study participants reported a perceived increase. They also found that 87.5% of the study participants joined because of the anticipated fun of the learning game, making fun a strong motivator for participation. Therefore, having an enjoyable or amusing time (i.e. fun) while learning is a significant predictor for the learning effort. Saez-Lopez et al [40] found in a two-year long study that using Scratch - a block-based visual programming interface - to teach programming to primary school children significantly increased students\u2019 knowledge; furthermore, students reported on having fun while learning with Scratch, a finding that is also supported by the observers\u2019 reports. However, that study did not examine the relationship between fun and learning. Complementary to this, Tisza and Markopoulos [52] found that having fun while learning to program contributed significantly to the perceived learning of primary school children. As it is seen, there is a variety in earlier research in terms of the assessment of learning. While some examined perceived learning [30, 31, 52], others investigated measured learning (i.e., pre-post tests) [40, 46, 55]. To our best knowledge, there are only a few studies that report on the relationship between fun and both the perceived and the measured learning [22, 54, 55].

However, sometimes the researcher overseeing the activity appeared in the field of view of the camera. For some other frames there were a few other children in the frame as well (visualized in the Figure 3). First, we used the OpenFace [1] library in the videos, in order to detect the faces for every frame. Thus, each face is given a label starting from left to right (1 to N, where N is the number of faces in each frame). There are three cases where the left-to-right labeling of faces fails as shown in Figure 3. First, when students are with the teacher and/or the researcher. Second, when classmates join the student for a short time. We need to keep the face to which the recording belongs. To achieve this, we used a pre-trained deep neural network, INCEPTION-v4 [50], to extract features from the individual face images and used a k- near neighbor prediction algorithm to recognize the original student in every recording. Figure 3 shows the example for all the three cases.

These biases include the time of the day, physical health condition, gender, age, overnight sleep, and others. All 4 data streams were normalized using the first 30 seconds of the data to remove the subjective and contextual biases from the data. For most of the frames in the video recordings, only one face was visible. However, sometimes the researcher overseeing the activity appeared in the field of view of the camera. For some other frames there were a few other children in the frame as well (visualized in the Figure 3). First, we used the OpenFace [1] library in the videos, in order to detect the faces for every frame. Thus, each face is given a label starting from left to right (1 to N, where N is the number of faces in each frame). There are three cases where the left-to-right labeling of faces fails as shown in Figure 3. First, when students are with the teacher and/or the researcher. Second, when classmates join the student for a short time. We need to keep the face to which the recording belongs. To achieve this, we used a pre-trained deep neural network, INCEPTION-v4 [50], to extract features from the individual face images and used a k-near neighbor prediction algorithm to recognize the original student in every recording. Figure 3 shows the example for all the three cases.

One can argue that the two measurements are not exactly the same, which is evident by the results reported in the paper. We have shown that there is a significant overlap between the retrospective measurement of fun (through questionnaire) and the spontaneous measurement of affect (through sensor data). Both measurements have been evaluated separately [11, 41, 53]. This study is an attempt to find a relationship between the two measurements to have more real-time information about the semantic beliefs and memories using the sensor data. Accordingly, we found that RLG and most of the FunQ dimensions can be explained by the CVT affective states (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and the transition between these).

We collected data from a questionnaire, and physiological response data collected by wrist-bands and facial video recordings. Using data from different modalities and analyzing them we provide a novel approach as earlier research has been limited to either the investigation of affective states (e.g., by interviews or surveys (e.g., [ 52]) or physiological measures (e.g., [ 45]). By combining these we extended our current body of knowledge by adding a new, physiological level of understanding of learning procedures. One can argue that the two measurements are not exactly the same, which is evident by the results reported in the paper. We have shown that there is a significant overlap between the retrospective measurement of fun (through questionnaire) and the spontaneous measurement of affect (through sensor data). Both measurements have been evaluated separately [11, 41, 53].

These processes and mechanisms could incur an affective disequilibrium that might be detrimental for learning, when students struggle to maintain and update their existing mental models with new information [19]. Given the range of processes involved, it would make sense that a single data stream would not be able to capture all these processes. Depending on the process of interest, different data streams may be more appropriate. Some of these data streams currently used within education include video, system logs, and physiological response data such as, electrodermal activity, heart rate variability, blood volume pulse, and skin temperature. Individually, these data streams have been used to explain and predict aspects of the cognitive processes and affective mechanisms [45].

This finding is in line with earlier research, which suggests that having fun while learning contributes to the learning outcomes [30, 31, 40, 52, 55].

By combining these we extended our current body of knowledge by adding a new, physiological level of understanding of learning procedures. One can argue that the two measurements are not exactly the same, which is evident by the results reported in the paper. We have shown that there is a significant overlap between the retrospective measurement of fun (through questionnaire) and the spontaneous measurement of affect (through sensor data). Both measurements have been evaluated separately [11, 41, 53]. This study is an attempt to find a relationship between the two measurements to have more real-time information about the semantic beliefs and memories using the sensor data. Accordingly, we found that RLG and most of the FunQ dimensions can be explained by the CVT affective states (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and the transition between these). Therefore, the introduced results indicate that there is a link between learners\u2019 affective states, their learning outcomes, and the fun they have experienced while learning.\n\nMore specifically, regarding students\u2019 learning and their affective states during coding activity (RQ1), we found that sadness, anger, and stress contribute negatively on students\u2019 learning, while arousal positively on it.

Sim et al [46] investigated fun, usability and learning in an educational software with seven and eight year-old children and found no correlation between learning (measured by the difference between the post- and pre-test scores) and fun or between fun and usability. In line with their findings, Iten and Petko [ 22] studying a serious game with child participants aged between 10 to 13 also found no significant relationship between fun and learning (perceived learning and measured learning calculated as the summary score for the current answers for the pre- and post-test). Contrasting these earlier findings, Tisza, Zhu and Markopoulos [55] found when investigating a serious game with 14-15 years old students that having fun while learning had a significant effect on students\u2019 perceived learning, but not on their measured learning (when considering their pre and post outcomes). Lucardie [31] investigating fun and enjoyment in adults\u2019 learning found that both learners and their teachers perceived fun as a motivator to attend classes, and as a contributor to learning knowledge and new skills. Related to coding, Long [30] studying the influence of a programming game on learners\u2019 (mostly adults) programming skills and knowledge found that about 80% of the study participants reported a perceived increase. They also found that 87.5% of the study participants joined because of the anticipated fun of the learning game, making fun a strong motivator for participation. Therefore, having an enjoyable or amusing time (i.e. fun) while learning is a significant predictor for the learning effort. Saez-Lopez et al [40] found in a two-year long study that using Scratch - a block-based visual programming interface - to teach programming to primary school children significantly increased students\u2019 knowledge; furthermore, students reported on having fun while learning with Scratch, a finding that is also supported by the observers\u2019 reports. However, that study did not examine the relationship between fun and learning. Complementary to this, Tisza and Markopoulos [52] found that having fun while learning to program contributed significantly to the perceived learning of primary school children. As it is seen, there is a variety in earlier research in terms of the assessment of learning.

Sim et al [46] investigated fun, usability and learning in an educational software with seven and eight year-old children and found no correlation between learning (measured by the difference between the post- and pre-test scores) and fun or between fun and usability. In line with their findings, Iten and Petko [ 22] studying a serious game with child participants aged between 10 to 13 also found no significant relationship between fun and learning (perceived learning and measured learning calculated as the summary score for the current answers for the pre- and post-test). Contrasting these earlier findings, Tisza, Zhu and Markopoulos [55] found when investigating a serious game with 14-15 years old students that having fun while learning had a significant effect on students\u2019 perceived learning, but not on their measured learning (when considering their pre and post outcomes). Lucardie [31] investigating fun and enjoyment in adults\u2019 learning found that both learners and their teachers perceived fun as a motivator to attend classes, and as a contributor to learning knowledge and new skills. Related to coding, Long [30] studying the influence of a programming game on learners\u2019 (mostly adults) programming skills and knowledge found that about 80% of the study participants reported a perceived increase. They also found that 87.5% of the study participants joined because of the anticipated fun of the learning game, making fun a strong motivator for participation. Therefore, having an enjoyable or amusing time (i.e. fun) while learning is a significant predictor for the learning effort. Saez-Lopez et al [40] found in a two-year long study that using Scratch - a block-based visual programming interface - to teach programming to primary school children significantly increased students\u2019 knowledge; furthermore, students reported on having fun while learning with Scratch, a finding that is also supported by the observers\u2019 reports. However, that study did not examine the relationship between fun and learning. Complementary to this, Tisza and Markopoulos [52] found that having fun while learning to program contributed significantly to the perceived learning of primary school children. As it is seen, there is a variety in earlier research in terms of the assessment of learning. While some examined perceived learning [30, 31, 52], others investigated measured learning (i.e., pre-post tests) [40, 46, 55]. To our best knowledge, there are only a few studies that report on the relationship between fun and both the perceived and the measured learning [22, 54, 55]. All of those studies report on regression analyses, indicating a slight difference between the two measures, however, without directly comparing them. Accordingly, understanding the relationship between the perceived and the measured learning, especially in reflection of the experienced fun while learning remains a topic to be addressed by future research. In sum, while earlier research appeared to be inconclusive on the role that fun plays on learning, recent empirical research results are supportive that fun contributes positively to the learning outcomes. This shift is proposed to be due to a better understanding of the notion of fun and accordingly, improved ways for the assessment of it."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-2691668": 1, "wikipedia-9545": 1, "wikipedia-31676015": 1, "wikipedia-1608493": 1, "wikipedia-22445549": 1, "wikipedia-40815333": 1, "wikipedia-30285461": 1, "wikipedia-307139": 1, "wikipedia-36898024": 1, "wikipedia-55358475": 1, "arxiv-2007.09863": 1, "arxiv-2405.18077": 1, "arxiv-2306.11003": 1, "arxiv-1502.03169": 1, "arxiv-1605.06414": 1, "arxiv-2305.04587": 1, "arxiv-1702.08244": 1, "arxiv-2005.13290": 1, "arxiv-2407.13900": 1, "arxiv-1512.03784": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/16": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/9": 3, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/38": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/42": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/21": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/37": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/33": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-2691668": 1, "wikipedia-9545": 1, "wikipedia-31676015": 1, "wikipedia-1608493": 1, "wikipedia-22445549": 1, "wikipedia-40815333": 1, "wikipedia-30285461": 1, "wikipedia-307139": 1, "wikipedia-36898024": 1, "wikipedia-55358475": 1, "arxiv-2007.09863": 1, "arxiv-2405.18077": 1, "arxiv-2306.11003": 1, "arxiv-1502.03169": 1, "arxiv-1605.06414": 1, "arxiv-2305.04587": 1, "arxiv-1702.08244": 1, "arxiv-2005.13290": 1, "arxiv-2407.13900": 1, "arxiv-1512.03784": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/16": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/9": 3, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/38": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/42": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/21": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/37": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/33": 1}}}

Pierre van Hiele noticed that his students tended to \"plateau\" at certain points in their understanding of geometry and he identified these plateau points as \"levels\". In general, these levels are a product of experience and instruction rather than age. This is in contrast to Piaget's theory of cognitive development, which is age-dependent. A child must have enough experiences (classroom or otherwise) with these geometric ideas to move to a higher level of sophistication. Through rich experiences, children can reach Level 2 in elementary school. Without such experiences, many adults (including teachers) remain in Level 1 all their lives, even if they take a formal geometry course in secondary school. The levels are as follows:\nLevel 0. Visualization: At this level, the focus of a child's thinking is on individual shapes, which the child is learning to classify by judging their holistic appearance. Children simply say, \"That is a circle,\" usually without further description. Children identify prototypes of basic geometrical figures (triangle, circle, square). These visual prototypes are then used to identify other shapes. A shape is a circle because it looks like a sun; a shape is a rectangle because it looks like a door or a box; and so on. A square seems to be a different sort of shape than a rectangle, and a rhombus does not look like other parallelograms, so these shapes are classified completely separately in the child\u2019s mind. Children view figures holistically without analyzing their properties. If a shape does not sufficiently resemble its prototype, the child may reject the classification. Thus, children at this stage might balk at calling a thin, wedge-shaped triangle (with sides 1, 20, 20 or sides 20, 20, 39) a \"triangle\", because it's so different in shape from an equilateral triangle, which is the usual prototype for \"triangle\". If the horizontal base of the triangle is on top and the opposing vertex below, the child may recognize it as a triangle, but claim it is \"upside down\". Shapes with rounded or incomplete sides may be accepted as \"triangles\" if they bear a holistic resemblance to an equilateral triangle. Squares are called \"diamonds\" and not recognized as squares if their sides are oriented at 45\u00b0 to the horizontal. Children at this level often believe something is true based on a single example.\nLevel 1. Analysis: At this level, the shapes become bearers of their properties. The objects of thought are classes of shapes, which the child has learned to analyze as having properties. A person at this level might say, \"A square has 4 equal sides and 4 equal angles. Its diagonals are congruent and perpendicular, and they bisect each other.\" The properties are more important than the appearance of the shape. If a figure is sketched on the blackboard and the teacher claims it is intended to have congruent sides and angles, the students accept that it is a square, even if it is poorly drawn. Properties are not yet ordered at this level. Children can discuss the properties of the basic figures and recognize them by these properties, but generally do not allow categories to overlap because they understand each property in isolation from the others. For example, they will still insist that \"a square is not a rectangle.\" (They may introduce extraneous properties to support such beliefs, such as defining a rectangle as a shape with one pair of sides longer than the other pair of sides.) Children begin to notice many properties of shapes, but do not see the relationships between the properties; therefore they cannot reduce the list of properties to a concise definition with necessary and sufficient conditions. They usually reason inductively from several examples, but cannot yet reason deductively because they do not understand how the properties of shapes are related.\nLevel 2. Abstraction: At this level, properties are ordered. The objects of thought are geometric properties, which the student has learned to connect deductively. The student understands that properties are related and one set of properties may imply another property. Students can reason with simple arguments about geometric figures. A student at this level might say, \"Isosceles triangles are symmetric, so their base angles must be equal.\" Learners recognize the relationships between types of shapes. They recognize that all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares, and they understand why squares are a type of rectangle based on an understanding of the properties of each. They can tell whether it is possible or not to have a rectangle that is, for example, also a rhombus. They understand necessary and sufficient conditions and can write concise definitions. However, they do not yet understand the intrinsic meaning of deduction. They cannot follow a complex argument, understand the place of definitions, or grasp the need for axioms, so they cannot yet understand the role of formal geometric proofs.\nLevel 3. Deduction: Students at this level understand the meaning of deduction. The object of thought is deductive reasoning (simple proofs), which the student learns to combine to form a system of formal proofs (Euclidean geometry). Learners can construct geometric proofs at a secondary school level and understand their meaning. They understand the role of undefined terms, definitions, axioms and theorems in Euclidean geometry. However, students at this level believe that axioms and definitions are fixed, rather than arbitrary, so they cannot yet conceive of non-Euclidean geometry. Geometric ideas are still understood as objects in the Euclidean plane.\nLevel 4. Rigor: At this level, geometry is understood at the level of a mathematician. Students understand that definitions are arbitrary and need not actually refer to any concrete realization. The object of thought is deductive geometric systems, for which the learner compares axiomatic systems. Learners can study non-Euclidean geometries with understanding. People can understand the discipline of geometry and how it differs philosophically from non-mathematical studies.", "BULLET::::- \"Information or inquiry\": students get acquainted with the material and begin to discover its structure. Teachers present a new idea and allow the students to work with the new concept. By having students experience the structure of the new concept in a similar way, they can have meaningful conversations about it. (A teacher might say, \"This is a rhombus. Construct some more rhombi on your paper.\")\nBULLET::::- \"Guided or directed orientation\": students do tasks that enable them to explore implicit relationships. Teachers propose activities of a fairly guided nature that allow students to become familiar with the properties of the new concept which the teacher desires them to learn. (A teacher might ask, \"What happens when you cut out and fold the rhombus along a diagonal? the other diagonal?\" and so on, followed by discussion.)\nBULLET::::- \"Explicitation\": students express what they have discovered and vocabulary is introduced. The students\u2019 experiences are linked to shared linguistic symbols. The van Hieles believe it is more profitable to learn vocabulary \"after\" students have had an opportunity to become familiar with the concept. The discoveries are made as explicit as possible. (A teacher might say, \"Here are the properties we have noticed and some associated vocabulary for the things you discovered. Let's discuss what these mean.\")\nBULLET::::- \"Free orientation\": students do more complex tasks enabling them to master the network of relationships in the material. They know the properties being studied, but need to develop fluency in navigating the network of relationships in various situations. This type of activity is much more open-ended than the guided orientation. These tasks will not have set procedures for solving them. Problems may be more complex and require more free exploration to find solutions. (A teacher might say, \"How could you construct a rhombus given only two of its sides?\" and other problems for which students have not learned a fixed procedure.)\nBULLET::::- \"Integration\": students summarize what they have learned and commit it to memory. The teacher may give the students an overview of everything they have learned. It is important that the teacher not present any new material during this phase, but only a summary of what has already been learned. The teacher might also give an assignment to remember the principles and vocabulary learned for future work, possibly through further exercises. (A teacher might say, \"Here is a summary of what we have learned. Write this in your notebook and do these exercises for homework.\") Supporters of the van Hiele model point out that traditional instruction often involves only this last phase, which explains why students do not master the material."], "wikipedia-42616278": ["Charles Perfetti focuses on recognizing specific components of reading which are generalized across cultures.

The idea of the study is based on the fact that object-extracted clauses increase in memory load which is why subject-extracted clauses are easier to comprehend. The fact that Chinese speakers lack grammatical relationships between arguments raises questions whether if the process of remembering a words context overshadows the extraction of clausal relationships. The English language is the opposite because sentences which are processed are structure-dependent."], "wikipedia-2363287": ["Section::::Techniques.\nA review study concluded that using graphic organizers improves student performance in the following areas:\nBULLET::::- Retention\nBULLET::::- Reading comprehension\nBULLET::::- Student achievement\nBULLET::::- Thinking and learning skills; critical thinking\n\nSection::::Infancy.:Supporting studies.\nA study by Haith, Hazan, & Goodman in 1988 showed that babies, as young as 3.5 months, are able to create short-term expectations of situations they confront. Expectations in this study refer to the cognitive and perceptual ways in which an infant can forecast a future event. This was tested by showing the infant either a predictable pattern of slides or an irregular pattern of slides and tracking the infant's eye movements. \nA later study by Johnson, Posner, & Rothbart in 1991 showed that by 4 months old, infants can develop expectations, but was tested through anticipatory looks and disengagement with stimuli. For example, anticipatory looks exhibit the infant is able to predict the next part of a pattern which can then be applied to the real world scenario of breast-feeding. Infants are able to predict a mother's movements and expect feeding so they can latch onto the nipple for feeding. Expectations, anticipatory looks, and disengagement all show that infants can learn visually, even if it is only short term. David Roberts (2016) tested multimedia learning propositions, he found that using certain images dislocates pedagogically harmful excesses of text, reducing cognitive overloading and exploiting under-used visual processing capacities \n\nSection::::In early childhood.\nFrom the ages 3\u20138 visual learning improves and begins to take many different forms. At the toddler age of 3\u20135, children's bodily actions structure the visual learning environment. At this age, toddlers are using their newly developed sensory-motor skills quite often and fusing them with their improved vision to understand the world around them. This is seen by toddler's using their arms to bring objects of interest close to their sensors, such as their eyes and face, to explore the object further. The act of bringing objects close to their face affects their immediate view by placing their mental and visual attention on that object and just blocking the view of other objects that are around them and out of view. There is an emphasis placed on objects and things that are directly in front of them and thus proximal vision is the primary perspective of visual learning. This is different from how adults utilize visual learning. This difference in toddler vision and adult vision is attributable to their body sizes, and body movements such that their visual experiences are created by their body movement. An adults view is broad, due to their larger body size, with most objects in view because of the distance between them and objects. Adults tend to scan a room, and see everything rather than focusing on one object only.\nThe way a child integrates visual learning with motor experiences enhances their perceptual and cognitive development. For elementary school children, aged 4\u201311, intellect is positively related to their level of auditory-visual integrative proficiency. The most significant period for the development of auditory-visual integration occurs between ages 5\u20137. During this time, the child has mastered visual-kinesthetic integration, and the child's visual learning can be applied to formal learning focused towards books and reading, rather than physical objects, thus impacting their intellect. As reading scores increase, children are able to learn more, and their visual learning has developed to not only focus on physical objects in close proximity to them, but also to interpret words and such to acquire knowledge by reading.\n\nSection::::In middle childhood.\nHere we categorize middle childhood as ages 9 to 14. By this stage in a child's normal development vision is sharp and learning processes are well underway. Most studies that have focused their efforts on visual learning have found that visual learning styles as opposed to traditional learning styles greatly improve the totality of a student's learning experience. First off, visual learning engages students and student engagement is one of the most important factors that motivated students to learn. Visuals increase student interest with the use of graphics animation, and video. Consequently, it has been found that student pay greater attention to lecture material when visuals are used. With increased attention to lesson material, many positive outcomes have been seen with the use of visual tactics in the classrooms of middle aged students. Students organize and process information more thoroughly when they learn visually which helps them to understand the information better. Students are more likely to remember information that is learned with a visual aid. When teachers used visual tactics to teach middle aged students they found that students had more positive attitudes about the material they were learning. Students also exemplified higher test performance, higher standard achievement scores, thinking on levels that require higher order thinking, and more engagement. One study also found that learning about emotional events, such as the Holocaust, with visual aids increase middle aged children's empathy."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a taxonomy for human facial movements as they appear on the face. Movements of individual facial muscles are encoded by FACS from slight instant changes in facial appearance. Using FACS it is possible to code nearly any anatomically possible emotion, deconstructing it into the specific AU that produced the facial expression. FACS is an established scheme for coding facial expressions, which is supported by multiple studies that have evaluated FACS with positive results with adults [11, 41]. Additionally, studies used the scheme in the previous years with children with positive results as well [35, 36]. Furthermore, it is a common standard to objectively describe emotions from facial expressions using such techniques [56]. Figure 4 shows the AUs detected for this paper and Table 1 shows how to define emotions from the AUs. In this paper, we are using the proportion of each emotion during the coding activity. We define happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise from the action units (shown in table 1). These affective states are a subset of achievement emotions included in Control-Value Theory [37]. These four CVT emotions are use because other emotions (e.g., disgust, contempt, relief) make less than 3% of the total interaction time. Therefore, we discarded the emotions that are not detected with a significant proportion of the interaction time. The interpretation of facial expressions can change from one situation to other however, the coding is well-evaluated and the qualitative interpretation in the context we studied will be done in our future analysis.

MMLA provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand students\u2019 behavior and performance during and after the learning sessions by understanding their relations with cognitive processes and affective mechanisms [12]. MMLA can provide insights into a multitude of behaviors including reasoning patterns [57], short-term memory usage [25], artefact quality [49], help-seeking and help-giving behavior [13], tentative and casual problem-solving behavior [2], and problem-solving phases [3, 48]. MMLA can be used to differentiate and identify different learning processes and behaviors [48, 57], as well as to explain the relationship between two behaviors, such as a student\u2019s physical actions and their reasoning during learning [2].

The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. For example, a video camera might capture facial expressions, body posture, and gestures, while a microphone might capture speech. Other sensors detect emotional cues by directly measuring physiological data, such as skin temperature and galvanic resistance.\nRecognizing emotional information requires the extraction of meaningful patterns from the gathered data. This is done using machine learning techniques that process different modalities, such as speech recognition, natural language processing, or facial expression detection, and produce either a labels (i.e. 'confused') or coordinates in a valence-arousal space."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a taxonomy for human facial movements as they appear on the face. Movements of individual facial muscles are encoded by FACS from slight instant changes in facial appearance. Using FACS it is possible to code nearly any anatomically possible emotion, deconstructing it into the specific AU that produced the facial expression. FACS is an established scheme for coding facial expressions, which is supported by multiple studies that have evaluated FACS with positive results with adults [11, 41]. Additionally, studies used the scheme in the previous years with children with positive results as well [35, 36]. Furthermore, it is a common standard to objectively describe emotions from facial expressions using such techniques [56]. Figure 4 shows the AUs detected for this paper and Table 1 shows how to define emotions from the AUs. In this paper, we are using the proportion of each emotion during the coding activity. We define happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise from the action units (shown in table 1). These affective states are a subset of achievement emotions included in Control-Value Theory [37]. These four CVT emotions are use because other emotions (e.g., disgust, contempt, relief) make less than 3% of the total interaction time. Therefore, we discarded the emotions that are not detected with a significant proportion of the interaction time. The interpretation of facial expressions can change from one situation to other however, the coding is well-evaluated and the qualitative interpretation in the context we studied will be done in our future analysis. This study focused more (being the first of its kind, to the best of our knowledge) on finding the relationships between CVT-based emotions and sensor and facial data."], "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/11": ["Given that a single data stream cannot capture all processes happening during learning activities as each data stream can only provide a partial view when used on its own, an upcoming field of research, multimodal learning analytics (MMLA), combines several of these data streams to serve as a virtual observer and analyst of learning activities [5, 45]. MMLA provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand students\u2019 behavior and performance during and after the learning sessions by understanding their relations with cognitive processes and affective mechanisms [12]. MMLA can provide insights into a multitude of behaviors including reasoning patterns [57], short-term memory usage [25], artefact quality [49], help-seeking and help-giving behavior [13], tentative and casual problem-solving behavior [2], and problem-solving phases [3, 48]. MMLA can be used to differentiate and identify different learning processes and behaviors [48, 57], as well as to explain the relationship between two behaviors, such as a student\u2019s physical actions and their reasoning during learning [2]. MMLA can shed light to learning processes that may be invisible to the human eye and that students cannot self-report on [13, 28, 35, 43].

Sim et al [46] investigated fun, usability and learning in an educational software with seven and eight year-old children and found no correlation between learning (measured by the difference between the post- and pre-test scores) and fun or between fun and usability. In line with their findings, Iten and Petko [ 22] studying a serious game with child participants aged between 10 to 13 also found no significant relationship between fun and learning (perceived learning and measured learning calculated as the summary score for the current answers for the pre- and post-test). Contrasting these earlier findings, Tisza, Zhu and Markopoulos [55] found when investigating a serious game with 14-15 years old students that having fun while learning had a significant effect on students\u2019 perceived learning, but not on their measured learning (when considering their pre and post outcomes). Lucardie [31] investigating fun and enjoyment in adults\u2019 learning found that both learners and their teachers perceived fun as a motivator to attend classes, and as a contributor to learning knowledge and new skills. Related to coding, Long [30] studying the influence of a programming game on learners\u2019 (mostly adults) programming skills and knowledge found that about 80% of the study participants reported a perceived increase. They also found that 87.5% of the study participants joined because of the anticipated fun of the learning game, making fun a strong motivator for participation. Therefore, having an enjoyable or amusing time (i.e. fun) while learning is a significant predictor for the learning effort. Saez-Lopez et al [40] found in a two-year long study that using Scratch - a block-based visual programming interface - to teach programming to primary school children significantly increased students\u2019 knowledge; furthermore, students reported on having fun while learning with Scratch, a finding that is also supported by the observers\u2019 reports. However, that study did not examine the relationship between fun and learning. Complementary to this, Tisza and Markopoulos [52] found that having fun while learning to program contributed significantly to the perceived learning of primary school children. As it is seen, there is a variety in earlier research in terms of the assessment of learning. While some examined perceived learning [30, 31, 52], others investigated measured learning (i.e., pre-post tests) [40, 46, 55]. To our best knowledge, there are only a few studies that report on the relationship between fun and both the perceived and the measured learning [22, 54, 55]. All of those studies report on regression analyses, indicating a slight difference between the two measures, however, without directly comparing them. Accordingly, understanding the relationship between the perceived and the measured learning, especially in reflection of the experienced fun while learning remains a topic to be addressed by future research.

Lucardie [31] investigating fun and enjoyment in adults\u2019 learning found that both learners and their teachers perceived fun as a motivator to attend classes, and as a contributor to learning knowledge and new skills. Related to coding, Long [30] studying the influence of a programming game on learners\u2019 (mostly adults) programming skills and knowledge found that about 80% of the study participants reported a perceived increase. They also found that 87.5% of the study participants joined because of the anticipated fun of the learning game, making fun a strong motivator for participation. Therefore, having an enjoyable or amusing time (i.e. fun) while learning is a significant predictor for the learning effort. Saez-Lopez et al [40] found in a two-year long study that using Scratch - a block-based visual programming interface - to teach programming to primary school children significantly increased students\u2019 knowledge; furthermore, students reported on having fun while learning with Scratch, a finding that is also supported by the observers\u2019 reports. However, that study did not examine the relationship between fun and learning. Complementary to this, Tisza and Markopoulos [52] found that having fun while learning to program contributed significantly to the perceived learning of primary school children. As it is seen, there is a variety in earlier research in terms of the assessment of learning. While some examined perceived learning [30, 31, 52], others investigated measured learning (i.e., pre-post tests) [40, 46, 55]. To our best knowledge, there are only a few studies that report on the relationship between fun and both the perceived and the measured learning [22, 54, 55]. All of those studies report on regression analyses, indicating a slight difference between the two measures, however, without directly comparing them. Accordingly, understanding the relationship between the perceived and the measured learning, especially in reflection of the experienced fun while learning remains a topic to be addressed by future research. In sum, while earlier research appeared to be inconclusive on the role that fun plays on learning, recent empirical research results are supportive that fun contributes positively to the learning outcomes. This shift is proposed to be due to a better understanding of the notion of fun and accordingly, improved ways for the assessment of it."], "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/31": ["Children\u2019s average FunQ score is 71.55 (SD = 9.756; Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.819, min: 50, max: 89), which is quite high if you consider that the possible scores range from 18 (lowest fun) to 90 (highest fun).\nWe also checked for any age- or gender-related biases for the RLG and the different FunQ dimensions (i.e., autonomy, challenge, delight, immersion, social barrier, stress). There was no correlation between the age of the children and their RLG or any of the FunQ dimensions. However, there was one exception. The social barrier was higher for boys than that for girls (F[1,37] = 4.63, p = 0.03, nine children had missing values). As we show in the main analysis that we did not find any significant relationship between the social barrier and physio-affective states, this bias will not be discussed in the light of the results reported in this paper.\n4.1 Results from Modeling the Relative Learning Gain (RQ1)\nWe modeled the relative learning gain (RLG) using the proportions of emotions, the transition among them, stress, and arousal. The overall model was significant (F (10, 37) = 10.41, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.72), accounting for 72% of explained variance in children\u2019s RLG. We found arousal and the transitions between happiness and surprise to be positive predictor for RGL, while sadness, anger, stress, and transition between sadness and anger contributed negatively to students\u2019 RLG. The coefficients of the significantly contributing predictors are in Table 3, the complete model is to see in Appendix 1.\n4.2 Results from Modeling the FunQ Dimensions (RQ2)\nWe modeled the FunQ Total Score and all the dimensions using the proportions of emotions, the transition among them, stress, and arousal. Below are the details for each of the dependent variables.\nFunQ Total Score: The overall model for the total score of FunQ was not significant (F (10, 37) = 1.44, p = 0.20, R2 = 0.26). We have provided the model details in Appendix 1. In other words, from the used physio-affective states we could not predict the total score of the FunQ.\nFunQ Autonomy: The overall model for the Autonomy dimension of FunQ was not significant (F (10, 37) = 1.47, p= 0.19, R-sq = .32). We have provided the model details in Appendix 1. In other words, from the investigated physio-affective states we could not predict the FunQ Autonomy scores.\nFunQ Challenge: The overall model was significant (F (10, 37) = 10.19, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.71), accounting for the 71% of explained variance in children\u2019s FunQ Challenge. Happiness, anger, arousal, and the transitions between happiness and sadness predict FunQ Challenge positively. On the other hand, sadness, surprise, and transition between sadness and surprise contribute negatively to FunQ Challenge. The coefficients of the significantly contributing predictors are shown in Table 4.\nFunQ Delight: We found the overall model to be significant (F (10, 37) = 9.93, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.65). The predictor model accounts for 65% of the explained variance in children\u2019s FunQ Delight. In details, happiness and surprise are positive predictors for FunQ Delight whereas, stress, and transition between happiness and anger contribute negatively to FunQ Delight. The coefficients of the significant predictors are shown in Table 4.\nFunQ Immersion: The overall model was significant (F (10, 37) = 8.16, p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.63), accounting for the 63% of explained variance in children\u2019s FunQ Immersion. Happiness and arousal are positive predictors for FunQ Immersion while the transition between sadness and anger contribute negatively to FunQ Immersion. The coefficients of the significant predictors are shown in Table 5.\nFunQ Social Barrier: The overall model for the social barrier dimension of FunQ was not significant (F (10, 37) = 1.09, p= 0.39, R2 = 0.17). We have provided the model details in Appendix 1.\nIn other words, from the investigated physio-affective states we could not predict the Social Barrier dimension of FunQ. As we mentioned earlier, there was a gender bias for this sub-construct. Boys (mean = 9.00, SD = 3.22) reported a higher social barrier than girls (mean = 7.11, SD = 1.99).

This finding is in line with earlier research, which suggests that having fun while learning contributes to the learning outcomes [30, 31, 40, 52, 55].

MMLA provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand students\u2019 behavior and performance during and after the learning sessions by understanding their relations with cognitive processes and affective mechanisms [12]. MMLA can provide insights into a multitude of behaviors including reasoning patterns [57], short-term memory usage [25], artefact quality [49], help-seeking and help-giving behavior [13], tentative and casual problem-solving behavior [2], and problem-solving phases [3, 48]. MMLA can be used to differentiate and identify different learning processes and behaviors [48, 57], as well as to explain the relationship between two behaviors, such as a student\u2019s physical actions and their reasoning during learning [2]. MMLA can shed light to learning processes that may be invisible to the human eye and that students cannot self-report on [13, 28, 35, 43].

We collected data from a questionnaire, and physiological response data collected by wristbands and facial video recordings.

By combining these we extended our current body of knowledge by adding a new, physiological level of understanding of learning procedures. One can argue that the two measurements are not exactly the same, which is evident by the results reported in the paper. We have shown that there is a significant overlap between the retrospective measurement of fun (through questionnaire) and the spontaneous measurement of affect (through sensor data). Both measurements have been evaluated separately [11, 41, 53]. This study is an attempt to find a relationship between the two measurements to have more real-time information about the semantic beliefs and memories using the sensor data. Accordingly, we found that RLG and most of the FunQ dimensions can be explained by the CVT affective states (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and the transition between these). Therefore, the introduced results indicate that there is a link between learners\u2019 affective states, their learning outcomes, and the fun they have experienced while learning. More specifically, regarding students\u2019 learning and their affective states during coding activity (RQ1), we found that sadness, anger, and stress contribute negatively on students\u2019 learning, while arousal positively on it.

These processes and mechanisms could incur an affective disequilibrium that might be detrimental for learning, when students struggle to maintain and update their existing mental models with new information [19]. Given the range of processes involved, it would make sense that a single data stream would not be able to capture all these processes. Depending on the process of interest, different data streams may be more appropriate. Some of these data streams currently used within education include video, system logs, and physiological response data such as, electrodermal activity, heart rate variability, blood volume pulse, and skin temperature. Individually, these data streams have been used to explain and predict aspects of the cognitive processes and affective mechanisms [45]. By extending these findings into interventions, researchers have used the data streams to scaffold the learning process to provide better learning support to students. Given that a single data stream cannot capture all processes happening during learning activities as each data stream can only provide a partial view when used on its own, an upcoming field of research, multimodal learning analytics (MMLA), combines several of these data streams to serve as a virtual observer and analyst of learning activities [5, 45]. MMLA provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand students\u2019 behavior and performance during and after the learning sessions by understanding their relations with cognitive processes and affective mechanisms [12]. MMLA can provide insights into a multitude of behaviors including reasoning patterns [57], short-term memory usage [25], artefact quality [49], help-seeking and help-giving behavior [13], tentative and casual problem-solving behavior [2], and problem-solving phases [3, 48]. MMLA can be used to differentiate and identify different learning processes and behaviors [48, 57], as well as to explain the relationship between two behaviors, such as a student\u2019s physical actions and their reasoning during learning [2]. MMLA can shed light to learning processes that may be invisible to the human eye and that students cannot self-report on [13, 28, 35, 43].

During imitation of angry facial expressions, botox decreased activation of brain regions implicated in emotional processing and emotional experience (namely, the amygdala and the brainstem), relative to activations before botox injection. These findings show that facial feedback modulates neural processing of emotional content, and that botox changes how the human brain responds to emotional situations.\n\nIn a study of cognitive processing of emotional content, David Havas and colleagues asked participants to read emotional (angry, sad, happy) sentences before and two weeks after botox injections in the corrugator supercilii muscle used in frowning. Reading times for angry and sad sentences were longer after botox injection than before injection, while reading times for happy sentences were unchanged.

Moreover, with high levels of engagement, children might also feel immersed and challenged at appropriate levels, which in turn might increase their ratings for the delight dimension of FunQ."], "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/11": ["Some of these data streams currently used within education include video, system logs, and physiological response data such as, electrodermal activity, heart rate variability, blood volume pulse, and skin temperature. Individually, these data streams have been used to explain and predict aspects of the cognitive processes and affective mechanisms [45]. By extending these findings into interventions, researchers have used the data streams to scaffold the learning process to provide better learning support to students.\n\nGiven that a single data stream cannot capture all processes happening during learning activities as each data stream can only provide a partial view when used on its own, an upcoming field of research, multimodal learning analytics (MMLA), combines several of these data streams to serve as a virtual observer and analyst of learning activities [5, 45]. MMLA provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand students\u2019 behavior and performance during and after the learning sessions by understanding their relations with cognitive processes and affective mechanisms [12]. MMLA can provide insights into a multitude of behaviors including reasoning patterns [57], short-term memory usage [25], artefact quality [49], help-seeking and help-giving behavior [13], tentative and casual problem-solving behavior [2], and problem-solving phases [3, 48]. MMLA can be used to differentiate and identify different learning processes and behaviors [48, 57], as well as to explain the relationship between two behaviors, such as a student\u2019s physical actions and their reasoning during learning [2]. MMLA can shed light to learning processes that may be invisible to the human eye and that students cannot self-report on [13, 28, 35, 43]. Therefore, MMLA can complement our understanding on how children learn, providing more information on children\u2019s affective aspects during the coding activities."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-10567836": 1, "wikipedia-25872075": 1, "wikipedia-10008223": 1, "wikipedia-43927635": 1, "wikipedia-18792699": 1, "wikipedia-24219779": 1, "wikipedia-22403616": 1, "wikipedia-540801": 1, "wikipedia-485923": 1, "wikipedia-10332": 1, "arxiv-1808.01384": 1, "arxiv-2211.09089": 1, "arxiv-2502.08587": 1, "arxiv-2311.16644": 1, "arxiv-2309.15839": 1, "arxiv-2310.19943": 1, "arxiv-2208.04206": 1, "arxiv-2208.08859": 1, "arxiv-2009.00260": 1, "arxiv-2105.10731": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/34": 3, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/36": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/14": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/11": 2, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/27": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/41": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-10567836": 1, "wikipedia-25872075": 1, "wikipedia-10008223": 1, "wikipedia-43927635": 1, "wikipedia-18792699": 1, "wikipedia-24219779": 1, "wikipedia-22403616": 1, "wikipedia-540801": 1, "wikipedia-485923": 1, "wikipedia-10332": 1, "arxiv-1808.01384": 1, "arxiv-2211.09089": 1, "arxiv-2502.08587": 1, "arxiv-2311.16644": 1, "arxiv-2309.15839": 1, "arxiv-2310.19943": 1, "arxiv-2208.04206": 1, "arxiv-2208.08859": 1, "arxiv-2009.00260": 1, "arxiv-2105.10731": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/34": 3, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/36": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/14": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/11": 3, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/3": 2, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/27": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/41": 2}}}

Anger and fear affective states, induced via film clips, conferred more selective attention on a flanker task compared to controls as indicated by reaction times that were not very different, even when the flanking letters were different from the middle target letter. Both anger and fear have high motivational intensity because propulsion to act would be high in the face of an angry or fearful stimulus, like a screaming person or coiled snake. Affects high in motivational intensity, thus, narrow cognitive scope making people able to focus more on target information. After seeing a sad picture, participants were faster to identify the larger letter in a Navon attention task, suggesting more global or broadened cognitive scope. The sad emotion is thought to sometimes have low motivational intensity. But, after seeing a disgusting picture, participants were faster to identify the component letters, indicative of a localized more narrow cognitive scope. Disgust has high motivational intensity. Affects high in motivational intensity, thus, narrow cognitive scope making people able to focus more on central information. whereas affects low in motivational intensity broadened cognitive scope allowing for faster global interpretation. The changes in cognitive scope associated with different affective states is evolutionarily adaptive because high motivational intensity affects elicited by stimuli that require movement and action should be focused on, in a phenomenon known as goal-directed behavior. Mood, like emotion, is an affective state. However, an emotion tends to have a clear focus (i.e., its cause is self-evident), while mood tends to be more unfocused and diffuse. Mood, according to Batson, Shaw and Oleson (1992), involves tone and intensity and a structured set of beliefs about general expectations of a future experience of pleasure or pain, or of positive or negative affect in the future. Unlike instant reactions that produce affect or emotion, and that change with expectations of future pleasure or pain, moods, being diffuse and unfocused and thus harder to cope with, can last for days, weeks, months or even years (Schucman, 1975). Moods are hypothetical constructs depicting an individual's emotional state.", "Affect, emotion, or feeling is displayed to others through facial expressions, hand gestures, posture, voice characteristics, and other physical manifestation.

Therefore, the sequence of tokens generated by an HMM gives some information about the sequence of states; this is also known as pattern theory, a topic of grammar induction.\nThe adjective \"hidden\" refers to the state sequence through which the model passes, not to the parameters of the model; the model is still referred to as a hidden Markov model even if these parameters are known exactly.\nHidden Markov models are especially known for their application in reinforcement learning and temporal pattern recognition such as speech, handwriting, gesture recognition, part-of-speech tagging, musical score following, partial discharges and bioinformatics.\nA hidden Markov model can be considered a generalization of a mixture model where the hidden variables (or latent variables), which control the mixture component to be selected for each observation, are related through a Markov process rather than independent of each other. Recently, hidden Markov models have been generalized to pairwise Markov models and triplet Markov models which allow consideration of more complex data structures and the modeling of nonstationary data.", "Hidden Markov models can model complex Markov processes where the states emit the observations according to some probability distribution. One such example is the Gaussian distribution; in such a Hidden Markov Model the states output are represented by a Gaussian distribution.\nMoreover, it could represent even more complex behavior when the output of the states is represented as mixture of two or more Gaussians, in which case the probability of generating an observation is the product of the probability of first selecting one of the Gaussians and the probability of generating that observation from that Gaussian. In cases of modeled data exhibiting artifacts such as outliers and skewness, one may resort to finite mixtures of heavier-tailed elliptical distributions, such as the multivariate Student's-t distribution, or appropriate non-elliptical distributions, such as the multivariate Normal Inverse-Gaussian.\nSection::::Extensions.\nIn the hidden Markov models considered above, the state space of the hidden variables is discrete, while the observations themselves can either be discrete (typically generated from a categorical distribution) or continuous (typically from a Gaussian distribution). Hidden Markov models can also be generalized to allow continuous state spaces. Examples of such models are those where the Markov process over hidden variables is a linear dynamical system, with a linear relationship among related variables and where all hidden and observed variables follow a Gaussian distribution. In simple cases, such as the linear dynamical system just mentioned, exact inference is tractable (in this case, using the Kalman filter); however, in general, exact inference in HMMs with continuous latent variables is infeasible, and approximate methods must be used, such as the extended Kalman filter or the particle filter.", "Finally, a different rationale towards addressing the problem of modeling nonstationary data by means of hidden Markov models was suggested in 2012. It consists in employing a small recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically a reservoir network, to capture the evolution of the temporal dynamics in the observed data. This information, encoded in the form of a high-dimensional vector, is used as a conditioning variable of the HMM state transition probabilities. Under such a setup, we eventually obtain a nonstationary HMM the transition probabilities of which evolve over time in a manner that is inferred from the data itself, as opposed to some unrealistic ad-hoc model of temporal evolution.\nThe model suitable in the context of longitudinal data is named\u00a0latent Markov model. The basic version of this model has been extended to include individual covariates, random effects and to model more complex data structures such as multilevel data. A complete overview of the latent Markov models, with special attention to the model assumptions and to their practical use is provided in"], "wikipedia-5850977": ["A hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is a statistical model with the same structure as a hidden Markov model except that the unobservable process is semi-Markov rather than Markov.

Sim et al [46] investigated fun, usability and learning in an educational software with seven and eight year-old children and found no correlation between learning (measured by the difference between the post- and pre-test scores) and fun or between fun and usability. In line with their findings, Iten and Petko [ 22] studying a serious game with child participants aged between 10 to 13 also found no significant relationship between fun and learning (perceived learning and measured learning calculated as the summary score for the current answers for the pre- and post-test). Contrasting these earlier findings, Tisza, Zhu and Markopoulos [55] found when investigating a serious game with 14-15 years old students that having fun while learning had a significant effect on students\u2019 perceived learning, but not on their measured learning (when considering their pre and post outcomes). Lucardie [31] investigating fun and enjoyment in adults\u2019 learning found that both learners and their teachers perceived fun as a motivator to attend classes, and as a contributor to learning knowledge and new skills. Related to coding, Long [30] studying the influence of a programming game on learners\u2019 (mostly adults) programming skills and knowledge found that about 80% of the study participants reported a perceived increase. They also found that 87.5% of the study participants joined because of the anticipated fun of the learning game, making fun a strong motivator for participation. Therefore, having an enjoyable or amusing time (i.e. fun) while learning is a significant predictor for the learning effort. Saez-Lopez et al [40] found in a two-year long study that using Scratch - a block-based visual programming interface - to teach programming to primary school children significantly increased students\u2019 knowledge; furthermore, students reported on having fun while learning with Scratch, a finding that is also supported by the observers\u2019 reports. However, that study did not examine the relationship between fun and learning. Complementary to this, Tisza and Markopoulos [52] found that having fun while learning to program contributed significantly to the perceived learning of primary school children. As it is seen, there is a variety in earlier research in terms of the assessment of learning. While some examined perceived learning [30, 31, 52], others investigated measured learning (i.e., pre-post tests) [40, 46, 55]. To our best knowledge, there are only a few studies that report on the relationship between fun and both the perceived and the measured learning [22, 54, 55]. All of those studies report on regression analyses, indicating a slight difference between the two measures, however, without directly comparing them. Accordingly, understanding the relationship between the perceived and the measured learning, especially in reflection of the experienced fun while learning remains a topic to be addressed by future research. In sum, while earlier research appeared to be inconclusive on the role that fun plays on learning, recent empirical research results are supportive that fun contributes positively to the learning outcomes. This shift is proposed to be due to a better understanding of the notion of fun and accordingly, improved ways for the assessment of it."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-1500025": 1, "wikipedia-14959867": 1, "wikipedia-5277007": 1, "wikipedia-7309022": 1, "wikipedia-44155493": 1, "wikipedia-37218385": 1, "wikipedia-30797587": 1, "wikipedia-44136736": 1, "wikipedia-5679464": 1, "wikipedia-57264039": 1, "arxiv-2310.11687": 1, "arxiv-cs/0606082": 1, "arxiv-2202.06351": 1, "arxiv-1711.01871": 1, "arxiv-1010.2506": 1, "arxiv-1602.06450": 1, "arxiv-2408.13147": 1, "arxiv-2306.07951": 1, "arxiv-2010.08101": 1, "arxiv-1912.03104": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/38": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/16": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/37": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/28": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/9": 2, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/11": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/41": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-1500025": 1, "wikipedia-14959867": 1, "wikipedia-5277007": 1, "wikipedia-7309022": 1, "wikipedia-44155493": 1, "wikipedia-37218385": 1, "wikipedia-30797587": 1, "wikipedia-44136736": 1, "wikipedia-5679464": 1, "wikipedia-57264039": 1, "arxiv-2310.11687": 1, "arxiv-cs/0606082": 1, "arxiv-2202.06351": 1, "arxiv-1711.01871": 1, "arxiv-1010.2506": 1, "arxiv-1602.06450": 1, "arxiv-2408.13147": 2, "arxiv-2306.07951": 1, "arxiv-2010.08101": 1, "arxiv-1912.03104": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/38": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/16": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/37": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/28": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/9": 3, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/11": 1, "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/41": 1}}}

Autonomous organizations or institutions are independent or self-governing. Autonomy can also be defined from a human resources perspective, where it denotes a (relatively high) level of discretion granted to an employee in his or her work. In such cases, autonomy is known to generally increase job satisfaction. Autonomy is a term that is also widely used in the field of medicine \u2014 personal autonomy is greatly recognized and valued in health care.\nSection::::Sociology.\nIn the sociology of knowledge, a controversy over the boundaries of autonomy inhibited analysis of any concept beyond relative autonomy, until a typology of autonomy was created and developed within science and technology studies. According to it, the institution of science's existing autonomy is \u201creflexive autonomy\u201d: actors and structures within the scientific field are able to translate or to reflect diverse themes presented by social and political fields, as well as influence them regarding the thematic choices on research projects.\nSection::::Sociology.:Institutional autonomy.\nInstitutional autonomy is having the capacities as a legislator to be able to implant and pursue official goals. Autonomous institutions are responsible for finding sufficient resources or modifying their plans, programs, courses, responsibilities, and services accordingly. But in doing so, they must contend with any obstacles that can occur, such as social pressure against cut-backs or socioeconomic difficulties. From a legislator's point of view, to increase institutional autonomy, conditions of self-management and institutional self-governance must be put in place. An increase in leadership and a redistribution of decision-making responsibilities would be beneficial to the research of resources. \nInstitutional autonomy was often seen as a synonym for self-determination, and many governments feared that it would lead institutions to an irredentist or secessionist region. But autonomy should be seen as a solution to self-determination struggles. Self-determination is a movement toward independence, whereas autonomy is a way to accommodate the distinct regions/groups within a country. Institutional autonomy can diffuse conflicts regarding minorities and ethnic groups in a society. Allowing more autonomy to groups and institutions helps create diplomatic relationships between them and the central government.", "The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples article 3 also through international law provides Human rights for Indigenous individuals through its third article by giving them a right to self-determination meaning they have all the liberties to choose their political status, and are capable to go and improve their economics social, and cultural statuses in society by developing it. Another example of this is article 4 of the same document which gives them autonomous rights when it comes to their internal or local affairs and how they can fund themselves in order to be able to self govern themselves.\nMinorities in countries are also protected as well by international law; the 27th article of the United Nations International covenant on Civil and Political rights or the ICCPR does so by allowing these individuals to be able to enjoy their own culture or use their language. Minorities in that manner are people from ethnic religious or linguistic groups according to the document.\nThe European Court of Human rights, is an international court that has been created on behalf of the European Conventions of Human rights. However, when it comes to autonomy they did not explicitly state it when it comes to the rights that individuals have. The current article 8 has remedied to that when the case of \"Pretty v the United Nations which was a case in 2002 involving assisted suicide\" where autonomy was used as a legal right in law. It was where Autonomy was distinguished and its reach into law was marked as well making it the foundations for legal precedent in making case law originating from the European Court of Human rights\nThe Yogyakarta Principles, a document with no binding effect in international human rights law, contend that \"self-determination\" used as meaning of autonomy on one's own matters including informed consent or sexual and reproductive rights, is integral for one's self-defined or gender identity and refused any medical procedures as a requirement for legal recognition of the gender identity of transgender. If eventually accepted by the international community in a treaty, this would make these ideas human rights in the law.

Education statistics published in May 2008 show that 75 million children were out of school in 2006, down from 103 million in 1999 UNESCO, 2008. Learning within the family setting, socialisation, is a large part of most children\u2019s learning experiences, it being where they first learn about roles, relationships and responsibilities within the family, the wider community and society, (Alexander & Clyne, 1995).\n\nWe also learn about our culture through social groups and through work, by experience and social interaction, sometimes called enculturation. Young children also learn through play, often in a social setting with their friends. This is in contrast with formal learning in academic environments that focuses on learning from descriptions of the real world, rather than from direct experience of it.", "We all continue to learn throughout our lives, mostly outside of formal education programmes and institutions.

Informal Education encompasses student interests within a curriculum in a regular classroom, but is not limited to that setting.

It can be discussion based and focuses on bridging the gaps between traditional classroom settings and life outside of the classroom.\nSection::::Role of Informal Education.\nPeople interpret information differently, and therefore a structured curriculum may not allow all learners to understand the information. Informal education is less controlled than the average classroom setting, which is why informal education can be so powerful. Informal education can help individuals learn to react to and control different situations and settings. In addition, it combines social entities that are important for learning. Informal Education may be viewed as the learning that comes as a part of being involved in youth and community organizations. This type of education is a spontaneous process, which helps people to learn information in a new way. It helps to cultivate communities, associations and relationships that make for a positive learning environment.\nSection::::Characteristics of Informal Education.\nBULLET::::1. Informal Education looks to create or deepen situations where people can learn, explore and enlarge experiences, and make changes.\nBULLET::::2. Provides an environment where everyone can learn together and can scaffold off of one another.\nBULLET::::3.

Informal Education is driven by conversation and interacting with others.\nSection::::Informal Education offers the following.\nBULLET::::1. Responsiveness when interacting with the environment.\nBULLET::::2. Possibility to act freely in unknown situations.\nBULLET::::3. Possibility for an individual to learn without any obligations or restrictions.\nBULLET::::4. Allows for free choice and changes in interests.\nBULLET::::5. Ability to create ones own identity.\nSection::::Informal Education tends to emphasize certain values it includes.\nBULLET::::1. Work for the well being of all.\nBULLET::::2.

Democracy and the active involvement of people in the issues that affect their life. (Jeff and Smith 2005:95-6)\nInformal Education focuses on values. There is no curriculum or guiding plan for a lot of work.\nSection::::Advantages.\nIf a person masters a skill by becoming deeply engaged in solving a problem, then giving students real world issues or opportunities to solve problems in their own lives and communities would significantly motivate and help them to master new concepts. Teaching students new scientific concepts by using cultural tools could eliminate the time spent trying to figure out whether concepts are useful or not. This may motivate learners and help them to master what we teach from the start. If we applied english and grammar lessons to effectively communicate with others in the community, students would be more inclined to effectively master these concepts since they would be using them for individual or group purposes.

In this way, students adjust their ideas to more closely resemble actual theories or concepts. By using this method students gain the broad understanding they're taught and later are more willing to learn and keep the specifics of the concept or theory. This theory further aligns with the idea that teaching the concepts and the language of a subject should be split into multiple steps.\nOther informal learning theories look at the sources of motivation for learning. Intrinsic motivation may create a more self-regulated learner, yet schools undermine intrinsic motivation.

Contrasting these earlier findings, Tisza, Zhu and Markopoulos [55] found when investigating a serious game with 14-15 years old students that having fun while learning had a significant effect on students\u2019 perceived learning, but not on their measured learning (when considering their pre and post outcomes). Lucardie [31] investigating fun and enjoyment in adults\u2019 learning found that both learners and their teachers perceived fun as a motivator to attend classes, and as a contributor to learning knowledge and new skills. Related to coding, Long [30] studying the influence of a programming game on learners\u2019 (mostly adults) programming skills and knowledge found that about 80% of the study participants reported a perceived increase. They also found that 87.5% of the study participants joined because of the anticipated fun of the learning game, making fun a strong motivator for participation. Therefore, having an enjoyable or amusing time (i.e. fun) while learning is a significant predictor for the learning effort. Saez-Lopez et al [40] found in a two-year long study that using Scratch - a block-based visual programming interface - to teach programming to primary school children significantly increased students\u2019 knowledge; furthermore, students reported on having fun while learning with Scratch, a finding that is also supported by the observers\u2019 reports.

Complementary to this, Tisza and Markopoulos [52] found that having fun while learning to program contributed significantly to the perceived learning of primary school children. As it is seen, there is a variety in earlier research in terms of the assessment of learning. While some examined perceived learning [30, 31, 52], others investigated measured learning (i.e., pre-post tests) [40, 46, 55]. To our best knowledge, there are only a few studies that report on the relationship between fun and both the perceived and the measured learning [22, 54, 55].

Accordingly, understanding the relationship between the perceived and the measured learning, especially in reflection of the experienced fun while learning remains a topic to be addressed by future research.

Related to coding, Long [30] studying the influence of a programming game on learners\u2019 (mostly adults) programming skills and knowledge found that about 80% of the study participants reported a perceived increase. They also found that 87.5% of the study participants joined because of the anticipated fun of the learning game, making fun a strong motivator for participation. Therefore, having an enjoyable or amusing time (i.e. fun) while learning is a significant predictor for the learning effort. Saez-Lopez et al [40] found in a two-year long study that using Scratch - a block-based visual programming interface - to teach programming to primary school children significantly increased students\u2019 knowledge; furthermore, students reported on having fun while learning with Scratch, a finding that is also supported by the observers\u2019 reports. However, that study did not examine the relationship between fun and learning. Complementary to this, Tisza and Markopoulos [52] found that having fun while learning to program contributed significantly to the perceived learning of primary school children. As it is seen, there is a variety in earlier research in terms of the assessment of learning. While some examined perceived learning [30, 31, 52], others investigated measured learning (i.e., pre-post tests) [40, 46, 55]. To our best knowledge, there are only a few studies that report on the relationship between fun and both the perceived and the measured learning [22, 54, 55]. All of those studies report on regression analyses, indicating a slight difference between the two measures, however, without directly comparing them. Accordingly, understanding the relationship between the perceived and the measured learning, especially in reflection of the experienced fun while learning remains a topic to be addressed by future research. In sum, while earlier research appeared to be inconclusive on the role that fun plays on learning, recent empirical research results are supportive that fun contributes positively to the learning outcomes. This shift is proposed to be due to a better understanding of the notion of fun and accordingly, improved ways for the assessment of it."], "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/0": ["We found that a) sadness, anger and stress are negatively, and arousal is positively related to students\u2019 relative learning gain (RLG), b) experienced fun is positively related to students\u2019 RLG and c) RLG and fun are related to certain physiological markers derived from the physiological response data."], "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/6": ["On top of that, we also found a positive and significant association between fun and students\u2019 RLG."], "paper/23/3501712.3529716.jsonl/31": ["We modeled the relative learning gain (RLG) using the proportions of emotions, the transition among them, stress, and arousal.

We collected data from a questionnaire, and physiological response data collected by wristbands and facial video recordings. Using data from different modalities and analyzing them we provide a novel approach as earlier research has been limited to either the investigation of affective states (e.g., by interviews or surveys (e.g., [ 52]) or physiological measures (e.g., [ 45]). By combining these we extended our current body of knowledge by adding a new, physiological level of understanding of learning procedures. One can argue that the two measurements are not exactly the same, which is evident by the results reported in the paper. We have shown that there is a significant overlap between the retrospective measurement of fun (through questionnaire) and the spontaneous measurement of affect (through sensor data). Both measurements have been evaluated separately [11, 41, 53]. This study is an attempt to find a relationship between the two measurements to have more real-time information about the semantic beliefs and memories using the sensor data. Accordingly, we found that RLG and most of the FunQ dimensions can be explained by the CVT affective states (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and the transition between these). Therefore, the introduced results indicate that there is a link between learners\u2019 affective states, their learning outcomes, and the fun they have experienced while learning.\n\nMore specifically, regarding students\u2019 learning and their affective states during coding activity (RQ1), we found that sadness, anger, and stress contribute negatively on students\u2019 learning, while arousal positively on it. This finding is in line with previous research that has investigated this relationship with traditional methods (i.e. questionnaires and observations) [29]. However, it also goes beyond those by applying MMLA and physiological measures.\n\nOur research results indicate that from physiological data we could not predict the level of fun - measured as the total score on FunQ \u2013 that children experienced while learning to code. Nevertheless, we found that the total FunQ score significantly correlates with the RLG (Pearson correlation = 0.33, p < 0.05).
