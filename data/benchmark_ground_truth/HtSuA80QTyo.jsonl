For example, accessing any single element in an array takes constant time as only one operation has to be performed to locate it. In a similar manner, finding the minimal value in an array sorted in ascending order; it is the first element. However, finding the minimal value in an unordered array is not a constant time operation as scanning over each element in the array is needed in order to determine the minimal value. Hence it is a linear time operation, taking O(n) time. If the number of elements is known in advance and does not change, however, such an algorithm can still be said to run in constant time.\nDespite the name \"constant time\", the running time does not have to be independent of the problem size, but an upper bound for the running time has to be bounded independently of the problem size. For example, the task \"exchange the values of \"a\" and \"b\" if necessary so that \"a\"\u2264\"b\"\" is called constant time even though the time may depend on whether or not it is already true that \"a\" \u2264 \"b\".

Since log \"n\" and log \"n\" are related by a constant multiplier, and such a multiplier is irrelevant to big-O classification, the standard usage for logarithmic-time algorithms is O(log \"n\") regardless of the base of the logarithm appearing in the expression of \"T\".\nAlgorithms taking logarithmic time are commonly found in operations on binary trees or when using binary search.\nAn O(log n) algorithm is considered highly efficient, as the ratio of the number of operations to the size of the input decreases and tends to zero when \"n\" increases. An algorithm that must access all elements of its input cannot take logarithmic time, as the time taken for reading an input of size \"n\" is of the order of \"n\".\nAn example of logarithmic time is given by dictionary search. Consider a dictionary which contains \"n\" entries, sorted by alphabetical order. We suppose that, for , one may access to the th entry of the dictionary in a constant time. Let denote this th entry. Under these hypotheses, the test if a word is in the dictionary may be done in logarithmic time: consider formula_8 where formula_9 denotes the floor function. If formula_10 then we are done. Else, if formula_11 continue the search in the same way in the left half of the dictionary, otherwise continue similarly with the right half of the dictionary. This algorithm is similar to the method often used to find an entry in a paper dictionary.\nSection::::Polylogarithmic time.\nAn algorithm is said to run in polylogarithmic time if \"T\"(\"n\") = O((log \"n\")), for some constant \"k\". For example, matrix chain ordering can be solved in polylogarithmic time on a parallel random-access machine.\nSection::::Sub-linear time.\nAn algorithm is said to run in sub-linear time (often spelled sublinear time) if \"T\"(\"n\") = o(\"n\"). In particular this includes algorithms with the time complexities defined above.\nTypical algorithms that are exact and yet run in sub-linear time use parallel processing (as the NC matrix determinant calculation does), or alternatively have guaranteed assumptions on the input structure (as the logarithmic time binary search and many tree maintenance algorithms do). However, formal languages such as the set of all strings that have a 1-bit in the position indicated by the first log(n) bits of the string may depend on every bit of the input and yet be computable in sub-linear time.\nThe specific term \"sublinear time algorithm\" is usually reserved to algorithms that are unlike the above in that they are run over classical serial machine models and are not allowed prior assumptions on the input. They are however allowed to be randomized, and indeed must be randomized for all but the most trivial of tasks.\nAs such an algorithm must provide an answer without reading the entire input, its particulars heavily depend on the access allowed to the input. Usually for an input that is represented as a binary string \"b\"...,\"b\" it is assumed that the algorithm can in time O(1) request and obtain the value of \"b\" for any \"i\".\nSub-linear time algorithms are typically randomized, and provide only approximate solutions. In fact, the property of a binary string having only zeros (and no ones) can be easily proved not to be decidable by a (non-approximate) sub-linear time algorithm. Sub-linear time algorithms arise naturally in the investigation of property testing.\nSection::::Linear time.\nAn algorithm is said to take linear time, or time, if its time complexity is . Informally, this means that the running time increases at most linearly with the size of the input. More precisely, this means that there is a constant such that the running time is at most for every input of size . For example, a procedure that adds up all elements of a list requires time proportional to the length of the list, if the adding time is constant, or, at least, bounded by a constant.\nLinear time is the best possible time complexity in situations where the algorithm has to sequentially read its entire input. Therefore, much research has been invested into discovering algorithms exhibiting linear time or, at least, nearly linear time. This research includes both software and hardware methods. There are several hardware technologies which exploit parallelism to provide this. An example is content-addressable memory. This concept of linear time is used in string matching algorithms such as the Boyer\u2013Moore algorithm and Ukkonen's algorithm.\nSection::::Quasilinear time.\nAn algorithm is said to run in quasilinear time (also referred to as log-linear time) if \"T\"(\"n\") = O(\"n\" log \"n\") for some positive constant \"k\"; linearithmic time is the case \"k\" = 1. Using soft O notation these algorithms are \u00d5(\"n\"). Quasilinear time algorithms are also O(\"n\") for every constant \u03b5 > 0, and thus run faster than any polynomial time algorithm whose time bound includes a term \"n\" for any \"c\" > 1.\nAlgorithms which run in quasilinear time include:\nBULLET::::- In-place merge sort, O(\"n\" log \"n\")\nBULLET::::- Quicksort, O(\"n\" log \"n\"), in its randomized version, has a running time that is O(\"n\" log \"n\") in expectation on the worst-case input. Its non-randomized version has a O(\"n\" log \"n\") running time only when considering average case complexity.\nBULLET::::- Heapsort, O(\"n\" log \"n\"), merge sort, introsort, binary tree sort, smoothsort, patience sorting, etc. in the worst case\nBULLET::::- Fast Fourier transforms, O(\"n\" log \"n\")"], "wikipedia-537519": ["BULLET::::- The worst case \"\u0398(n)\" when the pivot is the smallest or the largest element.\nformula_1\nformula_2\nformula_3\nformula_4\nBULLET::::- However, through randomization, where the pivot is randomly picked and is exactly a middle value each time, the QuickSort can be done in \"\u0398(nlogn)\".\nformula_5\nformula_6\nThe running time of QuickSort depends heavily on how well the pivot is selected. If a value of pivot is either too big or small, then the partition will be unbalanced. This case gives a poor running time. However, if the value of pivot is near the middle of the array, then the split will be reasonably well balanced. Thus its running time will be good. Since the pivot is randomly picked, the running time will be good most of the time and bad occasionally.\nIn case of average case, it is hard to determine since the analysis does not depend on the input distribution but on the random choices that the algorithm makes. The average of QuickSort is computed over all possible random choices that the algorithm might make when making the choice of pivot.\nAlthough the worst case running time is \"\u0398(n),\" the average-case running time is \"\u0398(nlogn).\" It turns out that the worst-case does not happen often. For large value of n, the running time is \"\u0398(nlogn)\" with a high probability.\nNote that the probability that the pivot is middle value element every time is one out of n numbers which is very rare.

This content can help partially answer the query.", "wikipedia-405944": ["In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to differ by at most a constant factor.\nSince an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input. Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases\u2014that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity. Therefore, the time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation, typically formula_1 formula_2 formula_3 formula_4 etc., where is the input size in units of bits needed to represent the input."], "wikipedia-18597245": ["In computational complexity theory and analysis of algorithms, a number of metrics are defined describing the resources, such as time or space, that a machine needs to solve a particular problem. Interpreting these metrics meaningfully requires context, and this context is frequently implicit and depends on the field and the problem under consideration. This article describes a number of important pieces of context and how they affect metrics.\n\nMetrics are usually described in terms of variables that are a function of the input. For example, the statement that insertion sort requires O(\"n\") comparisons is meaningless without defining \"n\", which in this case is the number of elements in the input list.\n\nBecause many different contexts use the same letters for their variables, confusion can arise. For example, the complexity of primality tests and multiplication algorithms can be measured in two different ways: one in terms of the integers being tested or multiplied, and one in terms of the number of binary digits (bits) in those integers. For example, if \"n\" is the integer being tested for primality, trial division can test it in \u0398(n) arithmetic operations; but if \"n\" is the number of bits in the integer being tested for primality, it requires \u0398(2) time. In the fields of cryptography and computational number theory, it is more typical to define the variable as the number of bits in the input integers.\n\nIn the field of computational complexity theory, the input is usually specified as a binary string (or a string in some fixed alphabet), and the variable is usually the number of bits in this string. This measure depends on the specific encoding of the input, which must be specified. For example, if the input is an integer specified using unary coding, trial division will require only \u0398(n) arithmetic operations; but if the same input is specified in binary (or any larger base) the complexity rises to \u0398(2) operations, not because the algorithm is taking any additional time, but because the number of bits in the input \"n\" has become exponentially smaller. In the other direction, \"succinct circuits\" are compact representations of a limited class of graphs that occupy exponentially less space than ordinary representations like adjacency lists. Many graph algorithms on succinct circuits are EXPTIME-complete, whereas the same problems expressed with conventional representations are only P-complete, because the succinct circuit inputs have smaller encodings.\n\nOutput-sensitive algorithms define their complexity not only in terms of their input but also their output. For example, Chan's algorithm can compute the convex hull of a set of points in O(\"n\" log \"h\") time, where \"n\" is the number of points in the input and \"h\" is the number of points in the resulting convex hull, a subset of the input points. Because every input point \"might\" be in the convex hull, an analysis in terms of the input alone would yield the less precise O(\"n\" log \"n\") time.\n\nTo analyze an algorithm precisely, one must assume it is being executed by a particular abstract machine. For example, on a random access machine, binary search can be used to rapidly locate a particular value in a sorted list in only O(log \"n\") comparisons, where \"n\" is the number of elements in the list; on a Turing machine, this is not possible, since it can only move one memory cell at a time and so requires \u03a9(\"n\") steps to even reach an arbitrary value in the list."], "wikipedia-3149636": ["In computational complexity theory, a numeric algorithm runs in pseudo-polynomial time if its running time is a polynomial in the \"numeric value\" of the input (the largest integer present in the input) \u2014 but not necessarily in the \"length\" of the input (the number of bits required to represent it), which is the case for polynomial time algorithms. In general, the numeric value of the input is exponential in the input length, which is why a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm does not necessarily run in polynomial time with respect to the input length. Consider the problem of testing whether a number \"n\" is prime, by naively checking whether no number in divides formula_1 evenly. This approach can take up to divisions, which is sub-linear in the \"value of n\" but exponential in the \"length of n\" (which is about formula_2). For example, a number \"n\" slightly less than would require up to approximately 100,000 divisions, even though the length of \"n\" is only 10 digits. Moreover one can easily write down an input (say, a 300-digit number) for which this algorithm is impractical. Since computational complexity measures difficulty with respect to the \"length\" of the (encoded) input, this naive algorithm is actually exponential. It \"is\", however, pseudo-polynomial time. Contrast this algorithm with a true polynomial numeric algorithm \u2014 say, the straightforward algorithm for addition: Adding two 9-digit numbers takes around 9 simple steps, and in general the algorithm is truly linear in the length of the input. Compared with the actual numbers being added (in the billions), the algorithm could be called \"pseudo-logarithmic time\", though such a term is not standard. Thus, adding 300-digit numbers is not impractical. Similarly, long division is quadratic: an \"m\"-digit number can be divided by a \"n\"-digit number in formula_3 steps (see Big O notation.) In the knapsack problem, we are given \"n\" items with weight \"w_i\" and value \"v_i\", along with a maximum weight capacity of a knapsack \"W\". The goal is to solve the following optimization problem; informally, what's the best way to fit the items into the knapsack to maximize value? Solving this problem is NP-hard, so a polynomial time algorithm is impossible unless P=NP. However, an \"O\"(\"nW\") time algorithm is possible using dynamic programming; since the number \"W\" only needs \"log\"(\"W\") bits to describe, this algorithm runs in pseudo-polynomial time."], "wikipedia-236683": ["Amortized analysis considers both the costly and less costly operations together over the whole series of operations of the algorithm.

For example, if it is known that the N objects are integers from the range [1, N], then they may be sorted O(N) time, e.g., by the bucket sort.\nA consequence of an algorithm being asymptotically optimal is that, for large enough inputs, no algorithm can outperform it by more than a constant factor. For this reason, asymptotically optimal algorithms are often seen as the \"end of the line\" in research, the attaining of a result that cannot be dramatically improved upon. Conversely, if an algorithm is not asymptotically optimal, this implies that as the input grows in size, the algorithm performs increasingly worse than the best possible algorithm."], "wikipedia-15374087": ["With respect to computational resources, asymptotic time complexity and asymptotic space complexity are commonly estimated. Other asymptotically estimated behavior include circuit complexity and various measures of parallel computation, such as the number of (parallel) processors.\nSince the ground-breaking 1965 paper by Juris Hartmanis and Richard E. Stearns and the 1979 book by Michael Garey and David S. Johnson on NP-completeness, the term \"computational complexity\" (of algorithms) has become commonly referred to as asymptotic computational complexity. \nFurther, unless specified otherwise, the term \"computational complexity\" usually refers to the upper bound for the asymptotic computational complexity of an algorithm or a problem, which is usually written in terms of the big O notation, e.g.. formula_1 Other types of (asymptotic) computational complexity estimates are lower bounds (\"Big Omega\" notation; e.g., \u03a9(\"n\")) and asymptotically tight estimates, when the asymptotic upper and lower bounds coincide (written using the \"big Theta\"; e.g., \u0398(\"n\" log \"n\")).\nA further tacit assumption is that the worst case analysis of computational complexity is in question unless stated otherwise. An alternative approach is probabilistic analysis of algorithms."], "wikipedia-44578": ["In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.\n\nBig O notation characterizes functions according to their growth rates: different functions with the same growth rate may be represented using the same O notation.\n\nBig O notation is useful when analyzing algorithms for efficiency. For example, the time (or the number of steps) it takes to complete a problem of size \"n\" might be found to be \"T\"(\"n\") = 4\"n\" \u2212 2\"n\" + 2.\n\nAs \"n\" grows large, the \"n\" term will come to dominate, so that all other terms can be neglected\u2014for instance when \"n\" = 500, the term 4\"n\" is 1000 times as large as the 2\"n\" term. Ignoring the latter would have negligible effect on the expression's value for most purposes.\n\nFurther, the coefficients become irrelevant if we compare to any other order of expression, such as an expression containing a term \"n\" or \"n\". Even if \"T\"(\"n\") = 1,000,000\"n\", if \"U\"(\"n\") = \"n\", the latter will always exceed the former once \"n\" grows larger than 1,000,000 (\"T\"(1,000,000) = 1,000,000= \"U\"(1,000,000)). Additionally, the number of steps depends on the details of the machine model on which the algorithm runs, but different types of machines typically vary by only a constant factor in the number of steps needed to execute an algorithm.\n\nSo the big O notation captures what remains: we write either\n\nor\n\nand say that the algorithm has \"order of n\" time complexity."], "wikipedia-145128": ["In the theoretical analysis of algorithms, the normal practice is to estimate their complexity in the asymptotic sense. The most commonly used notation to describe resource consumption or \"complexity\" is Donald Knuth's Big O notation, representing the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size of the input formula_5. Big O notation is an asymptotic measure of function complexity, where formula_6roughly means the time requirement for an algorithm is proportional to formula_7, omitting lower-order terms that contribute less than formula_8to the growth of the function as formula_9grows arbitrarily large. This estimate may be misleading when \"formula_5\"is small, but is generally sufficiently accurate when formula_5is large as the notation is asymptotic. For example, bubble sort may be faster than merge sort when only a few items are to be sorted; however either implementation is likely to meet performance requirements for a small list. Typically, programmers are interested in algorithms that scale efficiently to large input sizes, and merge sort is preferred over bubble sort for lists of length encountered in most data-intensive programs."], "wikipedia-405944": ["Since an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input. Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases\u2014that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity. Therefore, the time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation, typically formula_1 formula_2 formula_3 formula_4 etc., where is the input size in units of bits needed to represent the input. Algorithmic complexities are classified according to the type of function appearing in the big O notation.

Better asymptotic bounds on the time required to multiply matrices have been known since the work of Strassen in the 1960s, but it is still unknown what the optimal time is (i.e., what the complexity of the problem is).\n\nThis algorithm takes time (in asymptotic notation). A common simplification for the purpose of algorithms analysis is to assume that the inputs are all square matrices of size , in which case the running time is , i.e., cubic.\n\nThe complexity of this algorithm as a function of is given by the recurrence\naccounting for the eight recursive calls on matrices of size and to sum the four pairs of resulting matrices element-wise.

Brown and Ulgiati also called the sustainability index the \"Emergy Sustainability Index\" (ESI), \"an index that accounts for yield, renewability, and environmental load.

Can a strengthened institutional structure continue to deliver the results of technical cooperation to end users? The results may not be sustainable if, for example, the planning authority that depends on the technical cooperation loses access to top management, or is not provided with adequate resources after the technical cooperation ends. Institutional sustainability can also be linked to the concept of social sustainability, which asks how the interventions can be sustained by social structures and institutions;\n- Economic and financial sustainability. Can the results of technical cooperation continue to yield an economic benefit after the technical cooperation is withdrawn? For example, the benefits from the introduction of new crops may not be sustained if the constraints to marketing the crops are not resolved. Similarly, economic, as distinct from financial, sustainability may be at risk if the end users continue to depend on heavily subsidized activities and inputs.\n- Ecological sustainability.

The motivation for using metrics is the expectation that quantifying technical and environmental improvements can make the benefits of new technologies more tangible, perceptible, or understandable. This, in turn, is likely to aid the communication of research and potentially facilitate the wider adoption of green chemistry technologies in industry.\n\nFor a non-chemist the most attractive method of quoting the improvement might be \"a decrease of X unit cost per kilogram of compound Y\". This, however, would be an oversimplification\u2014for example, it would not allow a chemist to visualise the improvement made or to understand changes in material toxicity and process hazards. For yield improvements and selectivity increases, simple percentages are suitable, but this simplistic approach may not always be appropriate. For example, when a highly pyrophoric reagent is replaced by a benign one, a numerical value is difficult to assign but the improvement is obvious, if all other factors are similar.\n\nNumerous metrics have been formulated over time and their suitability discussed at great length. A general problem observed is that the more accurate and universally applicable the metric devised, the more complex and unemployable it becomes. A good metric must be clearly defined, simple, measurable, objective rather than subjective and must ultimately drive the desired behavior.\n\nSection::::Effective Mass Yield.\nEffective mass yield is defined as the percentage of the mass of the desired product relative to the mass of all non-benign materials used in its synthesis. Hudlicky \"et al.\" suggests the following equation:\nEffective mass yield (%) = mass of products \u00d7 100% / mass of non-benign reagents\nThis metric requires further definition of a benign substance. Hudlicky defines it as \u201cthose by-products, reagents or solvents that have no environmental risk associated with them, for example, water, low-concentration saline, dilute ethanol, autoclaved cell mass, etc.\u201d. This definition leaves the metric open to criticism, as nothing is non-benign (which is a subjective term) and the substances listed in the definition have some environmental impact associated with them. The formula also fails to address the level of toxicity associated with a process. Until all toxicology data is available for all chemicals and a term dealing with these levels of \u201cnon-benign\u201d reagents is written into the formula the effective mass yield is not the best metric for chemistry.\n\nSection::::Carbon efficiency.\nCarbon efficiency is how much carbon ends up in the useful product compared to how much carbon was used to create the product.\nCarbon efficiency (%) = amount of carbon in product \u00d7 100% / total carbon present in reactants\nThis metric is a good simplification for use in the pharmaceutical industry as it takes into account the stoichiometry of reactants and products. Furthermore, this metric is of interest to the pharmaceutical industry where development of carbon skeletons is key to their work.\n\nSection::::Atom economy.\nAtom economy is different from other green chemistry metrics, most of these were designed to measure process improvements. Barry Trost conversely, designed atom economy as a framework by which organic chemists would pursue \u201cgreener\u201d chemistry. The atom economy number is how much of the reactants remain in the final product. This is shown below:\nFor a generic multi-stage reaction:\nBULLET::::1. A + B \u2192 C\nBULLET::::2. C + D \u2192 E\nBULLET::::3. E + F \u2192 G\nAtom economy = m.w. of G \u00d7 100% /\n\u03a3 (m.w. A,B,D,F)\nThe drawback of this type of analysis is that assumptions have to be made. For example, reagents that do not end up in the final product (such as potassium carbonate in a Williamson ether synthesis) are ignored. Also, solvents are ignored.\nThe atom economy calculation is a very simple representation of the \u201cgreen-ness\u201d of a reaction as it can be carried out without the need for experimental results. However, it can be useful in the process synthesis early stage design.\n\nSection::::Reaction mass efficiency.\nThe reaction mass efficiency takes into account atom economy, chemical yield and stoichiometry. For a generic reaction A + B \u2192 C, the formula can take either of the two forms shown below:\n(1) Reaction mass efficiency = molecular weight of product C \u00d7 yield / \nm.w. A + (m.w. B \u00d7 molar ratio B/A)\n(2) Reaction mass efficiency = mass of product C \u00d7 100% / mass of A + mass of B\nThe conservation of mass principle dictates that the total molecular mass of the reactants is the same as the total molecular mass of the products. In an ideal chemical process, the amount of starting materials or reactants equals the amount of all products generated and no atom is wasted. However, in some processes, some of the consumed reactant atoms do not become part of the intended products. This can be a concern when raw materials are expensive or when economic and environmental costs of disposal of the waste are high.\nLike carbon efficiency, this measure shows the \u201cclean-ness\u201d of a reaction but not of a process. Neither metric takes into account waste produced. For example, these metrics could present a rearrangement as \u201cvery green\u201d but fail to address any solvent, work-up, and energy issues that make the process less attractive.\n\nSection::::Environmental (E) factor.\nThe first general metric for green chemistry remains one of the most flexible and popular ones. Roger A. Sheldon\u2019s E-factor can be made as complex and thorough or as simple as desired and useful.\nThe E-factor the ratio of the mass of waste per mass of product:\nAs examples, Sheldon calculated E-factors of various industries:\nIt highlights the waste produced in the process as opposed to the reaction, thus helping those who try to fulfil one of the twelve principles of green chemistry to avoid waste production. E-factors ignore recyclable factors such as recycled solvents and re-used catalysts, which obviously increases the accuracy but ignores the energy involved in the recovery (these are often included theoretically by assuming 90% solvent recovery). The main difficulty with E-factors is the need to define system boundaries, for example, which stages of the production or product life-cycle to consider before calculations can be made.\nCrucially, this metric is simple to apply industrially, as a production facility can measure how much material enters the site and how much leaves as product and waste, thereby directly giving an accurate global E-factor for the site. Table 1 shows that oil companies produce a lot less waste than pharmaceuticals as a percentage of material processed. This reflects the fact that the profit margins in the oil industry require them to minimise waste and find uses for products which would normally be discarded as waste. By contrast the pharmaceutical sector is more focused on molecule manufacture and quality. The (currently) high profit margins within the sector mean that there is less concern about the comparatively large amounts of waste that are produced (especially considering the volumes used) although it has to be noted that, despite the percentage waste and E-factor being high, the pharmaceutical section produces much lower tonnage of waste than any other sector. This table encouraged a number of large pharmaceutical companies to commence \u201cgreen\u201d chemistry programs.\nBy incorporating yield, stoichiometry and solvent usage the E-factor is an excellent metric. Crucially, E-factors can be combined to assess multi-step reactions step by step or in one calculation.\n\nSection::::The EcoScale.\nThe EcoScale metric was proposed in an article in the Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry in 2006 for evaluation of the effectiveness of a synthetic reaction. It is characterized by simplicity and general applicability. Like the yield-based scale, the EcoScale gives a score from 0 to 100, but also takes into account cost, safety, technical set-up, energy and purification aspects. It is obtained by assigning a value of 100 to an ideal reaction defined as \"Compound A (substrate) undergoes a reaction with (or in the presence of)inexpensive compound(s) B to give the desired compound C in 100% yield at room temperature with a minimal risk for the operator and a minimal impact on the environment\", and then subtracting penalty points for non-ideal conditions. These penalty points take into account both the advantages and disadvantages of specific reagents, set-ups and technologies."], "wikipedia-268344": ["Efficiency is often measured as the ratio of useful output to total input, which can be expressed with the mathematical formula \"r\"=\"P\"/\"C\", where \"P\" is the amount of useful output (\"product\") produced per the amount \"C\" (\"cost\") of resources consumed. This may correspond to a percentage if products and consumables are quantified in compatible units, and if consumables are transformed into products via a conservative process. For example, in the analysis of the energy conversion efficiency of heat engines in thermodynamics, the product \"P\" may be the amount of useful work output, while the consumable \"C\" is the amount of high-temperature heat input. Due to the conservation of energy, \"P\" can never be greater than \"C\", and so the efficiency \"r\" is never greater than 100% (and in fact must be even less at finite temperatures).\n\nSection::::In science and technology.:In physics.\nBULLET::::- Useful work per quantity of energy, mechanical advantage over ideal mechanical advantage, often denoted by the Greek lowercase letter \u03b7 (Eta):\nBULLET::::- Electrical efficiency\nBULLET::::- Energy conversion efficiency\nBULLET::::- Mechanical efficiency\nBULLET::::- Thermal efficiency, ratio of work done to thermal energy consumed\nBULLET::::- Efficient energy use, the objective of maximising efficiency\nBULLET::::- In thermodynamics:\nBULLET::::- Energy conversion efficiency, measure of second law thermodynamic loss\nBULLET::::- Radiation efficiency, ratio of radiated power to power absorbed at the terminals of an antenna\nBULLET::::- Volumetric efficiency, in internal combustion engine design for the RAF\nBULLET::::- Lift-to-drag ratio\nBULLET::::- Faraday efficiency, electrolysis\nBULLET::::- Quantum efficiency, a measure of sensitivity of a photosensitive device\nBULLET::::- Grating efficiency, a generalization of the reflectance of a mirror, extended to a diffraction grating\nSection::::In science and technology.:In economics.\nBULLET::::- Productivity improving technologies\nBULLET::::- Economic efficiency, the extent to which waste or other undesirable features are avoided\nBULLET::::- Market efficiency, the extent to which a given market resembles the ideal of an efficient market\nBULLET::::- Pareto efficiency, a state of its being impossible to make one individual better off, without making any other individual worse off\nBULLET::::- Kaldor-Hicks efficiency, a less stringent version of Pareto efficiency\nBULLET::::- Allocative efficiency, the optimal distribution of goods\nBULLET::::- Efficiency wages, paying workers more than the market rate for increased productivity\nBULLET::::- Business efficiency, revenues relative to expenses, etc.\nBULLET::::- Efficiency Movement, of the Progressive Era (1890\u20131932), advocated efficiency in the economy, society and government\nSection::::In science and technology.:In other sciences.\nBULLET::::- In computing:\nBULLET::::- Algorithmic efficiency, optimizing the speed and memory requirements of a computer program\nBULLET::::- Storage efficiency, effectiveness of computer data storage\nBULLET::::- Efficiency factor, in data communications\nBULLET::::- Efficiency (statistics), a measure of desirability of an estimator\nBULLET::::- Material efficiency, compares material requirements between construction projects or physical processes\nBULLET::::- Administrative efficiency, measuring transparency within public authorities and simplicity of rules and procedures for citizens and businesses\nBULLET::::- Photosynthetic efficiency"], "wikipedia-17132856": ["A large and still growing number of attempts to create aggregate measures of various aspects of sustainability created a stable of indices that provide a more nuanced perspective on development than economic aggregates such as GDP.

However, different resources such as time and space complexity cannot be compared directly, so which of two algorithms is considered to be more efficient often depends on which measure of efficiency is considered most important.\nFor example, bubble sort and timsort are both algorithms to sort a list of items from smallest to largest.

It often specifically comprises the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort. Efficiency refers to very different inputs and outputs in different fields and industries.\nEfficiency is very often confused with effectiveness. In general, efficiency is a measurable concept, quantitatively determined by the ratio of useful output to total input. Effectiveness is the simpler concept of being able to achieve a desired result, which can be expressed quantitatively but does not usually require more complicated mathematics than addition. Efficiency can often be expressed as a percentage of the result that could ideally be expected, for example if no energy were lost due to friction or other causes, in which case 100% of fuel or other input would be used to produce the desired result. In some cases efficiency can be indirectly quantified with a non-percentage value, e.g. specific impulse.\nEfficiency is often measured as the ratio of useful output to total input, which can be expressed with the mathematical formula \"r\"=\"P\"/\"C\", where \"P\" is the amount of useful output (\"product\") produced per the amount \"C\" (\"cost\") of resources consumed. This may correspond to a percentage if products and consumables are quantified in compatible units, and if consumables are transformed into products via a conservative process. For example, in the analysis of the energy conversion efficiency of heat engines in thermodynamics, the product \"P\" may be the amount of useful work output, while the consumable \"C\" is the amount of high-temperature heat input. Due to the conservation of energy, \"P\" can never be greater than \"C\", and so the efficiency \"r\" is never greater than 100% (and in fact must be even less at finite temperatures).\nBULLET::::- Algorithmic efficiency, optimizing the speed and memory requirements of a computer program"], "wikipedia-2801284": ["Proof complexity measures the efficiency of the proof system usually in terms of the minimal size of proofs possible in the system for a given tautology (or dually, and unsatisfiable formula)."], "wikipedia-3505721": ["Cost efficiency (or cost optimality), in the context of parallel computer algorithms, refers to a measure of how effectively parallel computing can be used to solve a particular problem.

Augmentation is also the term for the proportional lengthening of the value of individual note-shapes in older notation by coloration, by use of a sign of proportion, or by a notational symbol such as the modern dot. A major or perfect interval that is widened by a chromatic semitone is an augmented interval, and the process may be called augmentation.\n\nA melody or series of notes is \"augmented\" if the lengths of the notes are prolonged; augmentation is thus the opposite of diminution, where note values are shortened. A melody originally consisting of four quavers (eighth notes) for example, is augmented if it later appears with four crotchets (quarter notes) instead. This technique is often used in contrapuntal music, as in the \"canon by augmentation\" (\"\"per augmentationem\"\"), in which the notes in the following voice or voices are longer than those in the leading voice, usually twice the original length. The music of Johann Sebastian Bach provides examples of this application:\n\nOther ratios of augmentation, such as 1:3 (tripled note values) and 1:4 (quadrupled note values), are also possible. A motif is also augmented through expanding its duration.\n\nAugmentation may also be found in later, non-contrapuntal pieces, such as the Pastoral Symphony (Symphony No. 6) of Beethoven, where the melodic figure first heard in the second violins at the start of the \"Storm\" movement (\"\"Die Sturm\"\"):\n\n-is heard again in an augmented and transposed version in the same movement\u2019s closing ten bars:\n\nExamples of augmentation may be found in the development sections of sonata form movements, particularly in the symphonies of Brahms and Bruckner and in the protean leitmotifs in Wagner\u2019s operas, which undergo all kinds of transformation as the characters change and develop through the unfolding drama. \"Leitmotifs accumulate meaning, through expanding and fulfilling their musical potential.\" \n\nIn \u201cDoctor Gradus ad Parnassum\u201d, the first movement of his \"Children\u2019s Corner\" Suite, Debussy exploits augmentation in a humorous vein. It opens with a vigorous parody of a technical study by a pedagogical composer such as Clementi, involving a seemingly perpetual stream of fast semiquavers:\n\nIn bar 33, this energetic movement subsides, leading to a dreamy passage in the key of D flat, where the opening figures of the piece move at half speed:\n\nAccording to Frank Dawes, in this piece \u201cAn amusing picture of a child practising is conjured up, beginning with the best of intentions, growing weary and plainly yawning with boredom in the D flat section.\u201d Listen.\n\nAn interval is augmented if it is widened by a chromatic semitone. Thus an augmented fifth, for example, is a chromatic semitone wider than the perfect fifth. The standard abbreviations for augmented intervals are AX, such that an augmented third = A3.\n\nA good example of this can be seen in the left hand part of Chopin's famous E minor prelude Op. 28, No. 4. Many of the chord sequences change with the top or bottom note augmenting or diminishing the next chord as the music progresses.\n\nAn augmented chord is one which contains an augmented interval, almost invariably the 5th of the chord. An augmented triad is a major triad whose fifth has been raised by a chromatic semitone; it is the principal harmony of the whole tone scale."], "wikipedia-22497627": ["Aesthetic salons offer a variety of these treatments, seeking to eliminate almost all body hair possible using any number of methods. The proprietors of aesthetic salons often assert that shaving will result in thicker, darker coarser body hair. Two forms of electrolysis are among the most popular forms of hair removal, as well as what is known as \"threading\", a technique by which hair is plucked out using a folded string.\n\nSlimming treatments at Japanese aesthetic salons include cellophane body wraps, massages, use of different creams and lotions and of a variety of mechanical devises said to disintegrate or melt fat away from one's body. One popular technology-based treatment involves what is called \"Electrical Muscle Stimulation\" (EMS), where the muscles of the body are stimulated via electrical nodes hooked up to a microcurrent-emitting machine.\n\nWhile aesthetic technicians do not perform breast augmentation surgeries, they provide other services that are meant to increase the size of the breast, even out the sizes of the breasts or create different proportions of the chest area.

In particular, if the formula_4 are nonnegative but not integers, we could still use the dynamic programming algorithm by scaling and rounding (i.e. using fixed-point arithmetic), but if the problem requires formula_72 fractional digits of precision to arrive at the correct answer, formula_6 will need to be scaled by formula_74, and the DP algorithm will require formula_75 space and formula_76 time.\nThe algorithm takes formula_77 space, and efficient implementations of step 3 (for instance, sorting the subsets of B by weight, discarding subsets of B which weigh more than other subsets of B of greater or equal value, and using binary search to find the best match) result in a runtime of formula_78. As with the meet in the middle attack in cryptography, this improves on the formula_79 runtime of a naive brute force approach (examining all subsets of formula_80), at the cost of using exponential rather than constant space (see also baby-step giant-step).\nSection::::Solving.:Approximation algorithms.\nAs for most NP-complete problems, it may be enough to find workable solutions even if they are not optimal. Preferably, however, the approximation comes with a guarantee on the difference between the value of the solution found and the value of the optimal solution.\nAs with many useful but computationally complex algorithms, there has been substantial research on creating and analyzing algorithms that approximate a solution. The knapsack problem, though NP-Hard, is one of a collection of algorithms that can still be approximated to any specified degree. This means that the problem has a polynomial time approximation scheme. To be exact, the knapsack problem has a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS).\nSection::::Solving.:Approximation algorithms.:Greedy approximation algorithm.\nGeorge Dantzig proposed a greedy approximation algorithm to solve the unbounded knapsack problem. His version sorts the items in decreasing order of value per unit of weight, formula_81. It then proceeds to insert them into the sack, starting with as many copies as possible of the first kind of item until there is no longer space in the sack for more. Provided that there is an unlimited supply of each kind of item, if formula_82 is the maximum value of items that fit into the sack, then the greedy algorithm is guaranteed to achieve at least a value of formula_83. However, for the bounded problem, where the supply of each kind of item is limited, the algorithm may be far from optimal.\nSection::::Solving.:Approximation algorithms.:Fully polynomial time approximation scheme.\nThe fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the knapsack problem takes advantage of the fact that the reason the problem has no known polynomial time solutions is because the profits associated with the items are not restricted. If one rounds off some of the least significant digits of the profit values then they will be bounded by a polynomial and 1/\u03b5 where \u03b5 is a bound on the correctness of the solution. This restriction then means that an algorithm can find a solution in polynomial time that is correct within a factor of (1-\u03b5) of the optimal solution."], "wikipedia-1814357": ["Section::::Algorithms.:SAA5050 'diagonal smoothing'.\nThe Mullard SAA5050 Teletext character generator chip (1980) used a primitive pixel scaling algorithm to generate higher-resolution characters on screen from a lower-resolution representation from its internal ROM. Internally each character shape was defined on a 5\u00d79 pixel grid, which was then interpolated by smoothing diagonals to give a 10\u00d718 pixel character, with a characteristically angular shape, surrounded to the top and to the left by two pixels of blank space. The algorithm only works on monochrome source data, and assumes the source pixels will be logical true or false depending on whether they are 'on' or 'off'. Pixels 'outside the grid pattern' are assumed to be off.\nThe algorithm works as follows:\nNote that this algorithm, like the Eagle algorithm below, has a flaw:\nIf a pattern of 4 pixels in a hollow diamond shape appears, the hollow will be obliterated by the expansion.\nThe SAA5050's internal character ROM carefully avoids ever using this pattern.\nSection::::Algorithms.:EPX/Scale2\u00d7/AdvMAME2\u00d7.\nEric's Pixel Expansion (EPX) is an algorithm developed by Eric Johnston at LucasArts around 1992, when porting the SCUMM engine games from the IBM PC (which ran at 320\u00d7200\u00d7256 colors) to the early color Macintosh computers, which ran at more or less double that resolution.\nThe algorithm works as follows, expanding P into 4 new pixels based on P's surroundings:\nLater implementations of this same algorithm (as AdvMAME2\u00d7 and Scale2\u00d7, developed around 2001) have a slightly more efficient but functionally identical implementation:\nAdvMAME2\u00d7 is available in DOSBox via the codice_1 dosbox.conf option.\nThe AdvMAME4\u00d7/Scale4\u00d7 algorithm is just EPX applied twice to get 4\u00d7 resolution.\nSection::::Algorithms.:EPX/Scale2\u00d7/AdvMAME2\u00d7.:Scale3\u00d7/AdvMAME3\u00d7 and ScaleFX.\nThe AdvMAME3\u00d7/Scale3\u00d7 algorithm (available in DOSBox via the codice_2 dosbox.conf option) can be thought of as a generalization of EPX to the 3\u00d7 case.

This is a bug in the Eagle algorithm, but is solved by other algorithms such as EPX, 2xSaI and HQ2x.\nSection::::Algorithms.:Eagle.:2\u00d7SaI.\n2\u00d7SaI, short for 2\u00d7 Scale and Interpolation engine, was inspired by Eagle. It was designed by Derek Liauw Kie Fa, also known as Kreed, primarily for use in console and computer emulators, and it has remained fairly popular in this niche. Many of the most popular emulators, including ZSNES and VisualBoyAdvance, offer this scaling algorithm as a feature.\nSince Kreed released the source code under the GNU General Public License, it is freely available to anyone wishing to utilize it in a project released under that license. Developers wishing to use it in a non-GPL project would be required to rewrite the algorithm without using any of Kreed's existing code.\nIt is available in DosBox via codice_3 option.\nSection::::Algorithms.:Eagle.:Super 2\u00d7SaI and Super Eagle.\nSeveral slightly different versions of the scaling algorithm are available, and these are often referred to as \"Super 2\u00d7SaI\" and \"Super Eagle\". Super Eagle, which is also written by Kreed, is similar to the 2\u00d7SaI engine, but does more blending. Super 2\u00d7SaI, which is also written by Kreed, is a filter that smooths the graphics, but it blends more than the Super Eagle engine.\nSection::::Algorithms.:hq\"n\"x family.\nMaxim Stepin's hq2x, hq3x, and hq4x are for scale factors of 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 respectively. Each works by comparing the color value of each pixel to those of its eight immediate neighbours, marking the neighbours as close or distant, and using a pregenerated lookup table to find the proper proportion of input pixels' values for each of the 4, 9 or 16 corresponding output pixels. The hq3x family will perfectly smooth any diagonal line whose slope is \u00b10.5, \u00b11, or \u00b12 and which is not anti-aliased in the input; one with any other slope will alternate between two slopes in the output. It will also smooth very tight curves. Unlike 2xSaI, it anti-aliases the output. \nhq\"n\"x was initially created for the Super Nintendo emulator ZSNES. The author of bsnes has released a space-efficient implementation of hq2x to the public domain. A port to shaders, which has comparable quality to the early versions of xBR, is available. Prior to the port, a shader called \"scalehq\" has often been confused for hqx.\nSection::::Algorithms.:xBR family.\nThere are 6 filters in this family: xBR , xBRZ, xBR-Hybrid, Super xBR, xBR+3D and Super xBR+3D.\nxBR (\"scale by rules\"), created by Hyllian, works much the same way as HQx (based on pattern recognition), and would generate the same result as HQx when given the above pattern. However, it goes further than HQx by using a 2-stage set of interpolation rules, which better handle more complex patterns such as anti-aliased lines and curves. Scaled background textures keep the sharp characteristics of the original image, rather than becoming blurred like HQx (often ScaleHQ in practice) tends to do. Newest xBR versions are multi-pass and can preserve small details better. There is also a version of xBR combined with Reverse-AA shader called xBR-Hybrid. xBR+3D is a version with a 3D mask that only filters 2D elements.\nxBRZ by Zenju is a modified version of xBR. It is implemented from scratch as a CPU-based filter in C++ . It uses the same basic idea as xBR's pattern recognition and interpolation, but with a different rule set designed to preserve fine image details as small as a few pixels. This makes it useful for scaling the details in faces, and in particular eyes. xBRZ is optimized for multi-core CPUs and 64-bit architectures and shows 40\u201360% better performance than HQx even when running on a single CPU core only. It supports scaling images with an alpha channel, and scaling by factors from 2x up to 6x.\nSuper xBR is an algorithm developed by Hylian in 2015. It uses some combinations of known linear filters along with xBR edge detection rules in a non-linear way. It works in two passes and can only scale an image by two (or multiples of two by reapplying it and also has anti-ringing filter). Super xBR+3D is a version with a 3D mask that only filters 2D elements.\nThere is also a Super xBR version rewritten in C/C++.\nSection::::Algorithms.:RotSprite.\nRotSprite is a scaling and rotation algorithm for sprites developed by Xenowhirl. It produces far fewer artifacts than nearest-neighbor rotation algorithms, and like EPX, it does not introduce new colors into the image (unlike most interpolation systems).\nThe algorithm first scales the image to 8 times its original size with a modified Scale2\u00d7 algorithm which treats similar (rather than identical) pixels as matches. It then calculates what rotation offset to use by favoring sampled points which are not boundary pixels. Next, the rotated image is created with a nearest-neighbor scaling and rotation algorithm that simultaneously shr"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-632489": 2, "wikipedia-46936585": 3, "wikipedia-15641067": 3, "wikipedia-2736402": 1, "wikipedia-22074859": 2, "wikipedia-1881722": 1, "wikipedia-9815338": 1, "wikipedia-16974": 1, "wikipedia-1814357": 2, "wikipedia-17911717": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-632489": 3, "wikipedia-46936585": 3, "wikipedia-15641067": 3, "wikipedia-2736402": 1, "wikipedia-22074859": 3, "wikipedia-1881722": 2, "wikipedia-9815338": 1, "wikipedia-16974": 2, "wikipedia-1814357": 3, "wikipedia-17911717": 1}}}

Maurice Wilkes, an early computing pioneer, described his realization in the late 1940s that much of the rest of his life would be spent finding mistakes in his own programs.\nUsually, the most difficult part of debugging is finding the bug. Once it is found, correcting it is usually relatively easy. Programs known as debuggers help programmers locate bugs by executing code line by line, watching variable values, and other features to observe program behavior. Without a debugger, code may be added so that messages or values may be written to a console or to a window or log file to trace program execution or show values.\nHowever, even with the aid of a debugger, locating bugs is something of an art. It is not uncommon for a bug in one section of a program to cause failures in a completely different section, thus making it especially difficult to track (for example, an error in a graphics rendering routine causing a file I/O routine to fail), in an apparently unrelated part of the system.\nSometimes, a bug is not an isolated flaw, but represents an error of thinking or planning on the part of the programmer. Such \"logic errors\" require a section of the program to be overhauled or rewritten. As a part of code review, stepping through the code and imagining or transcribing the execution process may often find errors without ever reproducing the bug as such.\nMore typically, the first step in locating a bug is to reproduce it reliably. Once the bug is reproducible, the programmer may use a debugger or other tool while reproducing the error to find the point at which the program went astray."], "wikipedia-41912803": ["Algorithmic debugging (also called declarative debugging) is a debugging technique that compares the results of sub-computations with what the programmer intended.

While they may not offer step-by-step solutions, they cover common techniques (e.g., breakpoints, logging, unit testing) and principles that could partially address the query. For specific algorithmic bugs, additional resources might be needed.", "wikipedia-48892446": ["Automatic bug-fixing is the automatic repair of software bugs without the intervention of a human programmer. It is also commonly referred to as \"automatic patch generation\", \"automatic bug repair\", or \"automatic program repair\". The typical goal of such techniques is to automatically generate correct patches to eliminate bugs in software programs without causing software regression.\n\nSection::::Specification.\nAutomatic bug fixing is made according to a specification of the expected behavior which can be for instance a formal specification or a test suite.\nA test-suite \u2013 the input/output pairs specify the functionality of the program, possibly captured in assertions can be used as a test oracle to drive the search. This oracle can in fact be divided between the \"bug oracle\" that exposes the faulty behavior, and the \"regression oracle\", which encapsulates the functionality any program repair method must preserve. Note that a test suite is typically incomplete and does not cover all possible cases. Therefore, it is often possible for a validated patch to produce expected outputs for all inputs in the test suite but incorrect outputs for other inputs. The existence of such validated but incorrect patches is a major challenge for generate-and-validate techniques. Recent successful automatic bug-fixing techniques often rely on additional information other than the test suite, such as information learned from previous human patches, to further identify correct patches among validated patches.\nAnother way to specify the expected behavior is to use formal specifications Verification against full specifications that specify the whole program behavior including functionalities is less common because such specifications are typically not available in practice and the computation cost of such verification is prohibitive. For specific classes of errors, however, implicit partial specifications are often available. For example, there are targeted bug-fixing techniques validating that the patched program can no longer trigger overflow errors in the same execution path.\n\nSection::::Generate-and-validate techniques.\nGenerate-and-validate approaches compile and test each candidate patch to collect all validated patches that produce expected outputs for all inputs in the test suite. Such a technique typically starts with a test suite of the program, i.e., a set of test cases, at least one of which exposes the bug. An early generate-and-validate bug-fixing systems is GenProg. The effectiveness of generate-and-validate techniques remains controversial, because they typically do not provide patch correctness guarantees. Nevertheless, the reported results of recent state-of-the-art techniques are generally promising. For example, on systematically collected 69 real world bugs in eight large C software programs, the state-of-the-art bug-fixing system Prophet generates correct patches for 18 out of the 69 bugs.\nOne way to generate candidate patches is to apply mutation operators on the original program. Mutation operators manipulate the original program, potentially via its abstract syntax tree representation, or a more coarse-grained representation such as operating at the statement-level or block-level. Earlier genetic improvement approaches operate at the statement level and carry out simple delete/replace operations such as deleting an existing statement or replacing an existing statement with another statement in the same source file. Recent approaches use more fine-grained operators at the abstract syntax tree level to generate more diverse set of candidate patches.\nMany generate-and-validate techniques rely on the redundancy insight: the code of the patch can be found elsewhere in the application. This idea was introduced in the Genprog system, where two operators, addition and replacement of AST nodes, were based on code taken from elsewhere (i.e. adding an existing AST node). This idea has been validated empirically, with two independent studies that have shown that a significant proportion of commits (3%-17%) are composed of existing code. Beyond the fact that the code to reuse exists somewhere else, it has also been shown that the context of the potential repair ingredients is useful: often, the donor context is similar to the recipient context. \nUsing fix templates is an alternative way to generate candidate patches. Fix templates are typically predefined program mutation rules for fixing specific classes of bugs. Examples of fix templates include inserting a conditional statement to check whether the value of a variable is null to fix null pointer exception, and changing an integer constant by one to fix off-by-one errors. Fix templates are therefore often adopted by targeted techniques. It is also possible to automatically mine fix templates for generate-and-validate approches.\n\nSection::::Other techniques.\nRepair techniques exist that are based on symbolic execution. For example, Semfix uses symbolic execution to extract a repair constraint. Angelix introduced the concept of angelic forest in order to deal with multiline patches.\nUnder certain assumptions, it is possible to state the repair problem as a synthesis problem.\nSemFix and Nopol uses component-based synthesis.\nDynamoth uses dynamic synthesis.\nS3 is based on syntax-guided synthesis.\nSearchRepair converts potential patches into an SMT formula and queries candidate patches that allow the patched program to pass all supplied test cases.\nTargeted automatic bug-fixing techniques generate repairs for specific classes of errors such as null pointer exception integer overflow , buffer overflow , memory leak , etc.. Such techniques often use empirical fix templates to fix bugs in the targeted scope. For example, insert a conditional statement to check whether the value of a variable is null or insert missing memory deallocation statements. Comparing to generate-and-validate techniques, targeted techniques tend to have better bug-fixing accuracy but a much narrowed scope.\nMachine learning techniques can improve the effectiveness of automatic bug-fixing systems. One example of such techniques learns from past successful patches from human developers collected from open source repositories in GitHub and SourceForge. It then use the learned information to recognize and prioritize potentially correct patches among all generated candidate patches. Alternatively, patches can be directly mined from existing sources. Example approaches include mining patches from donor applications or from QA web sites."], "wikipedia-37085": ["Finding and fixing bugs, or \"debugging\", is a major part of computer programming. Maurice Wilkes, an early computing pioneer, described his realization in the late 1940s that much of the rest of his life would be spent finding mistakes in his own programs.\nUsually, the most difficult part of debugging is finding the bug. Once it is found, correcting it is usually relatively easy. Programs known as debuggers help programmers locate bugs by executing code line by line, watching variable values, and other features to observe program behavior. Without a debugger, code may be added so that messages or values may be written to a console or to a window or log file to trace program execution or show values.\nHowever, even with the aid of a debugger, locating bugs is something of an art. It is not uncommon for a bug in one section of a program to cause failures in a completely different section, thus making it especially difficult to track (for example, an error in a graphics rendering routine causing a file I/O routine to fail), in an apparently unrelated part of the system.\nSometimes, a bug is not an isolated flaw, but represents an error of thinking or planning on the part of the programmer. Such \"logic errors\" require a section of the program to be overhauled or rewritten. As a part of code review, stepping through the code and imagining or transcribing the execution process may often find errors without ever reproducing the bug as such.\nMore typically, the first step in locating a bug is to reproduce it reliably.

A model of computation may be defined in terms of an abstract computer, e.g., Turing machine, and/or by postulating that certain operations are executed in unit time.\nFor example, if the sorted list to which we apply binary search has \"n\" elements, and we can guarantee that each lookup of an element in the list can be done in unit time, then at most log \"n\" + 1 time units are needed to return an answer."], "wikipedia-6511": ["The study of the complexity of explicitly given algorithms is called analysis of algorithms, while the study of the complexity of problems is called computational complexity theory. Clearly, both areas are strongly related, as the complexity of an algorithm is always an upper bound of the complexity of the problem solved by this algorithm.\n\nSection::::Resources.\nSection::::Resources.:Time.\nThe resource that is most commonly considered is the time, and one talks of time complexity. When \"complexity\" is used without being qualified, this generally means time complexity.\nThe usual units of time are not used in complexity theory, because they are too dependent on the choice of a specific computer and of the evolution of the technology. Therefore, instead of the real time, one generally consider the elementary operations that are done during the computation. These operations are supposed to take a constant time on a given machine, and are often called \"steps\".\n\nSection::::Resources.:Space.\nAnother important resource is the size of computer memory that is needed for running algorithms.\n\nSection::::Resources.:Others.\nThe number of arithmetic operations is another resource that is commonly used. In this case, one talks of arithmetic complexity. If one knows an upper bound on the size of the binary representation of the numbers that occur during a computation, the time complexity is generally the product of the arithmetic complexity by a constant factor.\nFor many algorithms the size of the integers that are used during a computation is not bounded, and it is not realistic to consider that arithmetic operations take a constant time. Therefore, the time complexity, generally called bit complexity in this context, may be much larger than the arithmetic complexity. For example, the arithmetic complexity of the computation of the determinant of a integer matrix is formula_1 for the usual algorithms (Gaussian elimination). The bit complexity of the same algorithms is exponential in , because the size of the coefficients may grow exponentially during the computation. On the other hand, if these algorithms are coupled with multi-modular arithmetic, the bit complexity may be reduced to .\nIn sorting and searching, the resource that is generally considered is the number of entries comparisons. This is generally a good measure of the time complexity if data are suitably organized.\n\nSection::::Complexity as a function of input size.\nIt is impossible to count the number of steps of an algorithm on all possible inputs. As the complexity increases generally with the size of the input, the complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size (in bits) of the input, and therefore, the complexity is a function of . However, the complexity of an algorithm may vary dramatically for different inputs of the same size. Therefore several complexity functions are commonly used.\nThe worst-case complexity is the maximum of the complexity over all inputs of size , and the average-case complexity is the average of the complexity over all inputs of size (this makes sense, as the number of possible inputs of a given size is finite). Generally, when \"complexity\" is used without being further specified, this is the worst-case time complexity that is considered.\n\nSection::::Asymptotic complexity.\nIt is generally difficult to compute precisely the worst-case and the average-case complexity. In addition, these exact values provide little practical application, as any change of computer or of model of computation would change the complexity somewhat. Moreover, the resource use is not critical for small values of , and this makes that, for small , the ease of implementation is generally more interesting than a good complexity.\nFor these reasons, one generally focuses on the behavior of the complexity for large , that is on its asymptotic behavior when tends to the infinity. Therefore, the complexity is generally expressed by using big O notation.\nFor example, the usual algorithm for integer multiplication has a complexity of formula_2 this means that there is a constant formula_3 such that the multiplication of two integers of at most digits may be done in a time less than formula_4 This bound is \"sharp\" in the sense that the worst-case complexity and the average-case complexity are formula_5 which means that there is a constant formula_6 such that these complexities are larger than formula_7 The radix does not appear in these complexity, as changing of radix changes only the constants formula_3 and formula_9\n\nSection::::Models of computation.\nThe evaluation of the complexity relies on the choice of a model of computation, which consist in defining the basic operations that are done in a unit of time. When the model of computation is not explicitly specified, this is generally meant as being multitape Turing machine."], "wikipedia-405944": ["Time complexity\nIn computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to differ by at most a constant factor.\nSince an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input. Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases\u2014that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity. Therefore, the time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation, typically formula_1\nformula_2 formula_3 formula_4 etc., where is the input size in units of bits needed to represent the input.\nAlgorithmic complexities are classified according to the type of function appearing in the big O notation. For example, an algorithm with time complexity formula_5 is a \"linear time algorithm\" and an algorithm with time complexity formula_6 for some constant formula_7 is a \"polynomial time algorithm\"."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-15383889": 1, "wikipedia-2230": 2, "wikipedia-6511": 2, "wikipedia-15383952": 1, "wikipedia-405944": 2, "wikipedia-6497220": 1, "wikipedia-7543": 1, "wikipedia-603026": 1, "wikipedia-15497991": 1, "wikipedia-17909884": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-15383889": 2, "wikipedia-2230": 3, "wikipedia-6511": 3, "wikipedia-15383952": 1, "wikipedia-405944": 3, "wikipedia-6497220": 1, "wikipedia-7543": 2, "wikipedia-603026": 1, "wikipedia-15497991": 1, "wikipedia-17909884": 1}}}

Insertion sort is widely used for small data sets, while for large data sets an asymptotically efficient sort is used, primarily heap sort, merge sort, or quicksort. Efficient implementations generally use a hybrid algorithm, combining an asymptotically efficient algorithm for the overall sort with insertion sort for small lists at the bottom of a recursion. Highly tuned implementations use more sophisticated variants, such as Timsort (merge sort, insertion sort, and additional logic), used in Android, Java, and Python, and introsort (quicksort and heap sort), used (in variant forms) in some C++ sort implementations and in .NET.\n\nPractical general sorting algorithms are almost always based on an algorithm with average time complexity (and generally worst-case complexity) O(\"n\" log \"n\"), of which the most common are heap sort, merge sort, and quicksort.

Of the algorithms described here, this is the first that scales well to very large lists, because its worst-case running time is O(\"n\" log \"n\").\n\nHeapsort is a much more efficient version of selection sort. It also works by determining the largest (or smallest) element of the list, placing that at the end (or beginning) of the list, then continuing with the rest of the list, but accomplishes this task efficiently by using a data structure called a heap, a special type of binary tree. Using the heap, finding the next largest element takes O(log \"n\") time, instead of O(\"n\") for a linear scan as in simple selection sort. This allows Heapsort to run in O(\"n\" log \"n\") time, and this is also the worst case complexity.\n\nQuicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm which relies on a \"partition\" operation: to partition an array an element called a \"pivot\" is selected. All elements smaller than the pivot are moved before it and all greater elements are moved after it. This can be done efficiently in linear time and in-place. The lesser and greater sublists are then recursively sorted. This yields average time complexity of O(\"n\" log \"n\"), with low overhead, and thus this is a popular algorithm.

The input to the packed sorting algorithm, a sequence of items stored one per word, is transformed into a packed form, a sequence of words each holding multiple items in sorted order, by using this subroutine repeatedly to double the number of items packed into each word. Once the sequence is in packed form, Albers and Hagerup use a form of merge sort to sort it; when two sequences are being merged to form a single longer sequence, the same bitonic sorting subroutine can be used to repeatedly extract packed words consisting of the smallest remaining elements of the two sequences. This algorithm gains enough of a speedup from its packed representation to sort its input in linear time whenever it is possible for a single word to contain keys; that is, when for some constant .\n\nAn early result in this direction was provided by using the cell-probe model of computation (an artificial model in which the complexity of an algorithm is measured only by the number of memory accesses it performs). Building on their work, described two data structures, the Q-heap and the atomic heap, that are implementable on a random access machine. The Q-heap is a bit-parallel version of a binary trie, and allows both priority queue operations and successor and predecessor queries to be performed in constant time for sets of items, where is the size of the precomputed tables needed to implement the data structure. The atomic heap is a B-tree in which each tree node is represented as a Q-heap; it allows constant time priority queue operations (and therefore sorting) for sets of items.\n\nSince their work, even better algorithms have been developed. For instance, by repeatedly applying the Kirkpatrick\u2013Reisch range reduction technique until the keys are small enough to apply the Albers\u2013Hagerup packed sorting algorithm, it is possible to sort in time ; however, the range reduction part of this algorithm requires either a large memory (proportional to ) or randomization in the form of hash tables."], "wikipedia-22405006": ["Samplesort is a sorting algorithm that is a divide and conquer algorithm often used in parallel processing systems. Conventional divide and conquer sorting algorithms partitions the array into sub-intervals or buckets. The buckets are then sorted individually and then concatenated together. However, if the array is non-uniformly distributed, the performance of these sorting algorithms can be significantly throttled. Samplesort addresses this issue by selecting a sample of size s from the n-element sequence, and determining the range of the buckets by sorting the sample and choosing m -1 elements from the result. These elements (called splitters) then divide the sample into m equal-sized buckets. Samplesort is described in the 1970 paper, \"Samplesort: A Sampling Approach to Minimal Storage Tree Sorting\", by W. D. Frazer and A. C. McKellar.\n\nSamplesort is a generalization of quicksort. Where quicksort partitions its input into two parts at each step, based on a single value called the pivot, samplesort instead takes a larger sample from its input and divides its data into buckets accordingly. Like quicksort, it then recursively sorts the buckets.\n\nTo devise a samplesort implementation, one needs to decide on the number of buckets . When this is done, the actual algorithm operates in three phases:\nBULLET::::1. Sample elements from the input (the \"splitters\"). Sort these; each pair of adjacent splitters then defines a \"bucket\".\nBULLET::::2. Loop over the data, placing each element in the appropriate bucket. (This may mean: send it to a processor, in a multiprocessor system.)\nBULLET::::3. Sort each of the buckets.\nThe full sorted output is the concatenation of the buckets.\n\nA common strategy is to set equal to the number of processors available. The data is then distributed among the processors, which perform the sorting of buckets using some other, sequential, sorting algorithm.\n\nSamplesort is often used in parallel systems, including distributed systems such as bulk synchronous parallel machines. Due to the variable amount of splitters (in contrast to only one pivot in Quicksort), Samplesort is very well suited and intuitive for parallelization and scaling. Furthermore Samplesort is also more cache-efficient than implementations of e.g. quicksort.\n\nParallelization is implemented by splitting the sorting for each processor or node, where the number of buckets is equal to the number of processors formula_3. Samplesort is efficient in parallel systems because each processor receives approximately the same bucket size formula_21. Since the buckets are sorted concurrently, the processors will complete the sorting at approximately the same time, thus not having a processor wait for others."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Second, the algorithms often perform poorly on already sorted data or almost sorted data \u2013 these are common in real-world data, and can be sorted in O(\"n\") time by appropriate algorithms. Finally, they may also be unstable, and stability is often a desirable property in a sort. Thus more sophisticated algorithms are often employed, such as Timsort (based on merge sort) or introsort (based on quicksort, falling back to heap sort).\nSection::::Popular sorting algorithms.:Efficient sorts.:Merge sort.\n\"Merge sort\" takes advantage of the ease of merging already sorted lists into a new sorted list. It starts by comparing every two elements (i.e., 1 with 2, then 3 with 4...) and swapping them if the first should come after the second. It then merges each of the resulting lists of two into lists of four, then merges those lists of four, and so on; until at last two lists are merged into the final sorted list. Of the algorithms described here, this is the first that scales well to very large lists, because its worst-case running time is O(\"n\" log \"n\"). It is also easily applied to lists, not only arrays, as it only requires sequential access, not random access. However, it has additional O(\"n\") space complexity, and involves a large number of copies in simple implementations.\nMerge sort has seen a relatively recent surge in popularity for practical implementations, due to its use in the sophisticated algorithm Timsort, which is used for the standard sort routine in the programming languages Python and Java (as of JDK7). Merge sort itself is the standard routine in Perl, among others, and has been used in Java at least since 2000 in JDK1.3.\nSection::::Popular sorting algorithms.:Efficient sorts.:Heapsort.\n\"Heapsort\" is a much more efficient version of selection sort. It also works by determining the largest (or smallest) element of the list, placing that at the end (or beginning) of the list, then continuing with the rest of the list, but accomplishes this task efficiently by using a data structure called a heap, a special type of binary tree. Once the data list has been made into a heap, the root node is guaranteed to be the largest (or smallest) element. When it is removed and placed at the end of the list, the heap is rearranged so the largest element remaining moves to the root. Using the heap, finding the next largest element takes O(log \"n\") time, instead of O(\"n\") for a linear scan as in simple selection sort. This allows Heapsort to run in O(\"n\" log \"n\") time, and this is also the worst case complexity.\nSection::::Popular sorting algorithms.:Efficient sorts.:Quicksort.\n\"Quicksort\" is a divide and conquer algorithm which relies on a \"partition\" operation: to partition an array an element called a \"pivot\" is selected. All elements smaller than the pivot are moved before it and all greater elements are moved after it. This can be done efficiently in linear time and in-place. The lesser and greater sublists are then recursively sorted. This yields average time complexity of O(\"n\" log \"n\"), with low overhead, and thus this is a popular algorithm. Efficient implementations of quicksort (with in-place partitioning) are typically unstable sorts and somewhat complex, but are among the fastest sorting algorithms in practice. Together with its modest O(log \"n\") space usage, quicksort is one of the most popular sorting algorithms and is available in many standard programming libraries.\nThe important caveat about quicksort is that its worst-case performance is O(\"n\"); while this is rare, in naive implementations (choosing the first or last element as pivot) this occurs for sorted data, which is a common case. The most complex issue in quicksort is thus choosing a good pivot element, as consistently poor choices of pivots can result in drastically slower O(\"n\") performance, but good choice of pivots yields O(\"n\" log \"n\") performance, which is asymptotically optimal. For example, if at each step the median is chosen as the pivot then the algorithm works in O(\"n\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"n\"). Finding the median, such as by the median of medians selection algorithm is however an O(\"n\") operation on unsorted lists and therefore exacts significant overhead with sorting. In practice choosing a random pivot almost certainly yields O(\"n\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"n\") performance."], "wikipedia-31552761": ["Integer sorting algorithms including pigeonhole sort, counting sort, and radix sort are widely used and practical. Other integer sorting algorithms with smaller worst-case time bounds are not believed to be practical for computer architectures with 64 or fewer bits per word. Many such algorithms are known, with performance depending on a combination of the number of items to be sorted, number of bits per key, and number of bits per word of the computer performing the sorting algorithm.\n\nPigeonhole sort or counting sort can both sort data items having keys in the range from to in time . In pigeonhole sort (often called bucket sort), pointers to the data items are distributed to a table of buckets, represented as collection data types such as linked lists, using the keys as indices into the table. Then, all of the buckets are concatenated together to form the output list. Counting sort uses a table of counters in place of a table of buckets, to determine the number of items with each key. Then, a prefix sum computation is used to determine the range of positions in the sorted output at which the values with each key should be placed. Finally, in a second pass over the input, each item is moved to its key's position in the output array. Both algorithms involve only simple loops over the input data (taking time ) and over the set of possible keys (taking time ), giving their overall time bound.\n\nRadix sort is a sorting algorithm that works for larger keys than pigeonhole sort or counting sort by performing multiple passes over the data. Each pass sorts the input using only part of the keys, by using a different sorting algorithm (such as pigeonhole sort or counting sort) that is suited only for small keys. To break the keys into parts, the radix sort algorithm computes the positional notation for each key, according to some chosen radix; then, the part of the key used for the th pass of the algorithm is the th digit in the positional notation for the full key, starting from the least significant digit and progressing to the most significant. For this algorithm to work correctly, the sorting algorithm used in each pass over the data must be stable: items with equal digits should not change positions with each other. For greatest efficiency, the radix should be chosen to be near the number of data items, . Additionally, using a power of two near as the radix allows the keys for each pass to be computed quickly using only fast binary shift and mask operations. With these choices, and with pigeonhole sort or counting sort as the base algorithm, the radix sorting algorithm can sort data items having keys in the range from to in time ."], "wikipedia-22405006": ["Samplesort is a sorting algorithm that is a divide and conquer algorithm often used in parallel processing systems. Conventional divide and conquer sorting algorithms partitions the array into sub-intervals or buckets. The buckets are then sorted individually and then concatenated together. However, if the array is non-uniformly distributed, the performance of these sorting algorithms can be significantly throttled. Samplesort addresses this issue by selecting a sample of size s from the n-element sequence, and determining the range of the buckets by sorting the sample and choosing m -1 elements from the result. These elements (called splitters) then divide the sample into m equal-sized buckets. Samplesort is described in the 1970 paper, \"Samplesort: A Sampling Approach to Minimal Storage Tree Sorting\", by W. D. Frazer and A. C. McKellar.\n\nSamplesort is a generalization of quicksort. Where quicksort partitions its input into two parts at each step, based on a single value called the pivot, samplesort instead takes a larger sample from its input and divides its data into buckets accordingly. Like quicksort, it then recursively sorts the buckets.\n\nTo devise a samplesort implementation, one needs to decide on the number of buckets . When this is done, the actual algorithm operates in three phases:\nBULLET::::1. Sample elements from the input (the \"splitters\"). Sort these; each pair of adjacent splitters then defines a \"bucket\".\nBULLET::::2. Loop over the data, placing each element in the appropriate bucket. (This may mean: send it to a processor, in a multiprocessor system.)\nBULLET::::3. Sort each of the buckets.\nThe full sorted output is the concatenation of the buckets.\n\nA common strategy is to set equal to the number of processors available. The data is then distributed among the processors, which perform the sorting of buckets using some other, sequential, sorting algorithm.\n\nSamplesort is often used in parallel systems, including distributed systems such as bulk synchronous parallel machines. Due to the variable amount of splitters (in contrast to only one pivot in Quicksort), Samplesort is very well suited and intuitive for parallelization and scaling. Furthermore Samplesort is also more cache-efficient than implementations of e.g. quicksort.\n\nParallelization is implemented by splitting the sorting for each processor or node, where the number of buckets is equal to the number of processors formula_3. Samplesort is efficient in parallel systems because each processor receives approximately the same bucket size formula_21. Since the buckets are sorted concurrently, the processors will complete the sorting at approximately the same time, thus not having a processor wait for others.\n\nOn distributed systems, the splitters are chosen by taking formula_2 elements on each processor, sorting the resulting formula_45 elements with a distributed sorting algorithm, taking every formula_2-th element and broadcasting the result to all processors. This costs formula_47 for sorting the formula_45 elements on formula_3 processors, as well as formula_50 for distributing the formula_3 chosen splitters to formula_3 processors.\n\nWith the resulting splitters, each processor places its own input data into local buckets. This takes formula_53 with binary search. Thereafter, the local buckets are redistributed to the processors. Processor formula_54 gets the local buckets formula_55 of all other processors and sorts these locally. The distribution takes formula_56 time, where formula_57 is the size of the biggest bucket. The local sorting takes formula_58."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-28442": 2, "wikipedia-58123003": 1, "wikipedia-31552761": 2, "wikipedia-43934137": 1, "wikipedia-2204154": 1, "wikipedia-4416073": 1, "wikipedia-485158": 1, "wikipedia-1345537": 1, "wikipedia-40323": 1, "wikipedia-22405006": 2}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-28442": 3, "wikipedia-58123003": 1, "wikipedia-31552761": 3, "wikipedia-43934137": 1, "wikipedia-2204154": 1, "wikipedia-4416073": 1, "wikipedia-485158": 1, "wikipedia-1345537": 1, "wikipedia-40323": 1, "wikipedia-22405006": 3}}}

It also works by determining the largest (or smallest) element of the list, placing that at the end (or beginning) of the list, then continuing with the rest of the list, but accomplishes this task efficiently by using a data structure called a heap, a special type of binary tree. Once the data list has been made into a heap, the root node is guaranteed to be the largest (or smallest) element. When it is removed and placed at the end of the list, the heap is rearranged so the largest element remaining moves to the root. Using the heap, finding the next largest element takes O(log \"n\") time, instead of O(\"n\") for a linear scan as in simple selection sort. This allows Heapsort to run in O(\"n\" log \"n\") time, and this is also the worst case complexity.\n\"Quicksort\" is a divide and conquer algorithm which relies on a \"partition\" operation: to partition an array an element called a \"pivot\" is selected. All elements smaller than the pivot are moved before it and all greater elements are moved after it. This can be done efficiently in linear time and in-place.

This complexity for lookups is the same as for self-balancing binary search trees.\nIn some data structures, an array of structures is used. In such cases, the same sorting methods can be used to sort the structures according to some key as a structure element; for example, sorting records of students according to roll numbers or names or grades.\nIf one is using a sorted dynamic array, then it is possible to insert and delete elements. The insertion and deletion of elements in a sorted array executes at O(\"n\"), due to the need to shift all the elements following the element to be inserted or deleted; in comparison a self-balancing binary search tree inserts and deletes at O(log \"n\").

Other integer sorting algorithms with smaller worst-case time bounds are not believed to be practical for computer architectures with 64 or fewer bits per word. Many such algorithms are known, with performance depending on a combination of the number of items to be sorted, number of bits per key, and number of bits per word of the computer performing the sorting algorithm.\n\nPigeonhole sort or counting sort can both sort data items having keys in the range from to in time . In pigeonhole sort (often called bucket sort), pointers to the data items are distributed to a table of buckets, represented as collection data types such as linked lists, using the keys as indices into the table. Then, all of the buckets are concatenated together to form the output list. Counting sort uses a table of counters in place of a table of buckets, to determine the number of items with each key. Then, a prefix sum computation is used to determine the range of positions in the sorted output at which the values with each key should be placed. Finally, in a second pass over the input, each item is moved to its key's position in the output array. Both algorithms involve only simple loops over the input data (taking time ) and over the set of possible keys (taking time ), giving their overall time bound.\n\nRadix sort is a sorting algorithm that works for larger keys than pigeonhole sort or counting sort by performing multiple passes over the data. Each pass sorts the input using only part of the keys, by using a different sorting algorithm (such as pigeonhole sort or counting sort) that is suited only for small keys. To break the keys into parts, the radix sort algorithm computes the positional notation for each key, according to some chosen radix; then, the part of the key used for the th pass of the algorithm is the th digit in the positional notation for the full key, starting from the least significant digit and progressing to the most significant. For this algorithm to work correctly, the sorting algorithm used in each pass over the data must be stable: items with equal digits should not change positions with each other. For greatest efficiency, the radix should be chosen to be near the number of data items, . Additionally, using a power of two near as the radix allows the keys for each pass to be computed quickly using only fast binary shift and mask operations. With these choices, and with pigeonhole sort or counting sort as the base algorithm, the radix sorting algorithm can sort data items having keys in the range from to in time ."], "wikipedia-1478246": ["External sorting algorithms generally fall into two types, distribution sorting, which resembles quicksort, and external merge sort, which resembles merge sort. The latter typically uses a hybrid sort-merge strategy. In the sorting phase, chunks of data small enough to fit in main memory are read, sorted, and written out to a temporary file. In the merge phase, the sorted subfiles are combined into a single larger file.\n\nOne example of external sorting is the external merge sort algorithm, which is a K-way merge algorithm. It sorts chunks that each fit in RAM, then merges the sorted chunks together.\nThe algorithm first sorts items at a time and puts the sorted lists back into external memory. It then recursively does a formula_2-way merge on those sorted lists. To do this merge, elements from each sorted list are loaded into internal memory, and the minimum is repeatedly outputted.\nFor example, for sorting 900 megabytes of data using only 100 megabytes of RAM:\nBULLET::::1. Read 100 MB of the data in main memory and sort by some conventional method, like quicksort.\nBULLET::::2. Write the sorted data to disk.\nBULLET::::3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all of the data is in sorted 100 MB chunks (there are 900MB / 100MB = 9 chunks), which now need to be merged into one single output file.\nBULLET::::4. Read the first 10 MB (= 100MB / (9 chunks + 1)) of each sorted chunk into input buffers in main memory and allocate the remaining 10 MB for an output buffer. (In practice, it might provide better performance to make the output buffer larger and the input buffers slightly smaller.)\nBULLET::::5. Perform a 9-way merge and store the result in the output buffer. Whenever the output buffer fills, write it to the final sorted file and empty it. Whenever any of the 9 input buffers empties, fill it with the next 10 MB of its associated 100 MB sorted chunk until no more data from the chunk is available. This is the key step that makes external merge sort work externally -- because the merge algorithm only makes one pass sequentially through each of the chunks, each chunk does not have to be loaded completely; rather, sequential parts of the chunk can be loaded as needed."], "wikipedia-28249": ["The appropriate search algorithm often depends on the data structure being searched, and may also include prior knowledge about the data. Some database structures are specially constructed to make search algorithms faster or more efficient, such as a search tree, hash map, or a database index. \nSearch algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching. Linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion. Binary, or half interval searches, repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. Comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order. Digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures that use numerical keys. Finally, hashing directly maps keys to records based on a hash function. Searches outside a linear search require that the data be sorted in some way."], "wikipedia-4261562": ["A sorting algorithm falls into the adaptive sort family if it takes advantage of existing order in its input. It benefits from the presortedness in the input sequence \u2013 or a limited amount of disorder for various definitions of measures of disorder \u2013 and sorts faster. Adaptive sorting is usually performed by modifying existing sorting algorithms.\n\nComparison-based sorting algorithms have traditionally dealt with achieving an optimal bound of \"O\"(\"n\" log \"n\") when dealing with time complexity. Adaptive sort takes advantage of the existing order of the input to try to achieve better times, so that the time taken by the algorithm to sort is a smoothly growing function of the size of the sequence \"and\" the disorder in the sequence. In other words, the more presorted the input is, the faster it should be sorted.\n\nThis is an attractive algorithm because nearly sorted sequences are common in practice. Thus, the performance of existing sort algorithms can be improved by taking into account the existing order in the input.\n\nNote that most worst-case sorting algorithms that do optimally well in the worst-case, notably heap sort and merge sort, do not take existing order within their input into account, although this deficiency is easily rectified in the case of merge sort by checking if the last element of the lefthand group is less than (or equal) to the first element of the righthand group, in which case a merge operation may be replaced by simple concatenation \u2013 a modification that is well within the scope of making an algorithm adaptive.\n\nA classic example of an adaptive sorting algorithm is \"Straight Insertion Sort\". In this sorting algorithm, we scan the input from left to right, repeatedly finding the position of the current item, and insert it into an array of previously sorted items.\n\nIn pseudo-code form, the \"Straight Insertion Sort\" algorithm could look something like this (array X is zero-based):\n\nThe performance of this algorithm can be described in terms of the number of inversions in the input, and then will be roughly equal to , where is the number of Inversions. Using this measure of presortedness \u2013 being relative to the number of inversions \u2013 \"Straight Insertion Sort\" takes less time to sort the closer it is to being sorted.\n\nOther examples of adaptive sorting algorithms are adaptive heap sort, adaptive merge sort, patience sort, Shellsort, smoothsort, splaysort and Timsort."], "wikipedia-144656": ["For sorting, either a weak order, \"should not come after\", can be specified, or a strict weak order, \"should come before\" (specifying one defines also the other, the two are the complement of the inverse of each other, see operations on binary relations). For the sorting to be unique, these two are restricted to a total order and a strict total order, respectively.\nSorting n-tuples (depending on context also called e.g. records consisting of fields) can be done based on one or more of its components. More generally objects can be sorted based on a property. Such a component or property is called a sort key.\nFor example, the items are books, the sort key is the title, subject or author, and the order is alphabetical.\nA new sort key can be created from two or more sort keys by lexicographical order. The first is then called the primary sort key, the second the secondary sort key, etc.\nFor example, addresses could be sorted using the city as primary sort key, and the street as secondary sort key.\nIf the sort key values are totally ordered, the sort key defines a weak order of the items: items with the same sort key are equivalent with respect to sorting. See also stable sorting. If different items have different sort key values then this defines a unique order of the items.\nA standard order is often called \"ascending\" (corresponding to the fact that the standard order of numbers is ascending, i.e. A to Z, 0 to 9), the reverse order \"descending\" (Z to A, 9 to 0). For dates and times, \"ascending\" means that earlier values precede later ones e.g. 1/1/2000 will sort ahead of 1/1/2001.\nSection::::Sorting information or data.:Common sorting algorithms.\nBULLET::::- Bubble/Shell sort : Exchange two adjacent elements if they are out of order.

With the explosion in the number of genome projects due to the advancements in DNA sequencing technologies, particularly the next-generation sequencing methods in late 2000s, this field has become more sophisticated, making it possible to deal with many genomes in a single study. Comparative genomics has revealed high levels of similarity between closely related organisms, such as humans and chimpanzees, and, more surprisingly, similarity between seemingly distantly related organisms, such as humans and the yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\". It has also showed the extreme diversity of the gene composition in different evolutionary lineages.\n\nOne character of biology is evolution, evolutionary theory is also the theoretical foundation of comparative genomics, and at the same time the results of comparative genomics unprecedentedly enriched and developed the theory of evolution. When two or more of the genome sequence are compared, one can deduce the evolutionary relationships of the sequences in a phylogenetic tree. Based on a variety of biological genome data and the study of vertical and horizontal evolution processes, one can understand vital parts of the gene structure and its regulatory function.\n\nSimilarity of related genomes is the basis of comparative genomics. If two creatures have a recent common ancestor, the differences between the two species genomes are evolved from the ancestors\u2019 genome.

Thus, the genome sequences can be used to identify gene function, by analyzing their homology (sequence similarity) to genes of known function.\n\nOrthologous sequences are related sequences in different species: a gene exists in the original species, the species divided into two species, so genes in new species are orthologous to the sequence in the original species. Paralogous sequences are separated by gene cloning (gene duplication): if a particular gene in the genome is copied, then the copy of the two sequences is paralogous to the original gene. A pair of orthologous sequences is called orthologous pairs (orthologs), a pair of paralogous sequence is called collateral pairs (paralogs). Orthologous pairs usually have the same or similar function, which is not necessarily the case for collateral pairs. In collateral pairs, the sequences tend to evolve into having different functions.\n\nComparative genomics exploits both similarities and differences in the proteins, RNA, and regulatory regions of different organisms to infer how selection has acted upon these elements. Those elements that are responsible for similarities between different species should be conserved through time (stabilizing selection), while those elements responsible for differences among species should be divergent (positive selection). Finally, those elements that are unimportant to the evolutionary success of the organism will be unconserved (selection is neutral).\n\nOne of the important goals of the field is the identification of the mechanisms of eukaryotic genome evolution. It is however often complicated by the multiplicity of events that have taken place throughout the history of individual lineages, leaving only distorted and superimposed traces in the genome of each living organism.

Such a measurement should not be application dependent or arbitrary. A reasonable definition for the similarity between two objects is how difficult it is to transform them into each other.\n\nOne can define the information distance between strings formula_1 and formula_2 as the length of the shortest program formula_3 that computes formula_1 from formula_2 and vice versa. This shortest program is in a fixed programming language. For technical reasons one uses the theoretical notion of Turing machines. Moreover, to express the length of formula_3 one uses the notion of Kolmogorov complexity. Then, it has been shown up to logarithmic additive terms which can be ignored. This information distance is shown to be a metric (it satisfies the metric inequalities up to a logarithmic additive term), is universal (it minorizes every computable distance as computed for example from features up to a constant additive term).\n\nThe information distance is absolute, but if we want to express similarity, then we are more interested in relative ones. For example, if two strings of length 1,000,000 differ by 1000 bits, then we are inclined to think that those strings are relatively more similar than two strings of 1000 bits that have that distance. Hence we need to normalize to obtain a similarity metric. This way one obtains the normalized information distance (NID), where formula_9 is algorithmic information of formula_1 given formula_2 as input. The NID is called `the similarity metric.' since the function formula_12 has been shown to satisfy the basic requirements for a metric distance measure.

The \"N50\" is similar to a mean or median of lengths, but has greater weight given to the longer contigs. It is used widely in genome assembly, especially in reference to contig lengths within a draft assembly. \"L50\" is the number of contigs whose summed length is \"N50\". There are also the related U50, UL50, UG50, UG50%, N90, NG50, and D50 statistics.\nTo provide a better assessment of assembly output for viral and microbial datasets, a new metric called U50 should be used. The \"U50\" identifies unique, target-specific contigs by using a reference genome as baseline, aiming at circumventing some limitations that are inherent to the \"N50\" metric. The use of the \"U50\" metric allows for a more accurate measure of assembly performance by analyzing only the unique, non-overlapping contigs. Most viral and microbial sequencing have high background noise (i.e., host and other non-targets), which contributes to having a skewed, misrepresented \"N50\" value - this is corrected by \"U50\".\nSection::::Definition.\nSection::::Definition.:N50.\nN50 statistic defines assembly quality in terms of contiguity. Given a set of contigs, the \"N50\" is defined as the sequence length of the shortest contig at 50% of the total genome length. It can be thought of as the point of half of the mass of the distribution; the number of bases from all contigs longer than the \"N50\" will be close to the number of bases from all contigs shorter than the \"N50\". For example, consider 9 contigs with the lengths 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,and 10; their sum is 54, half of the sum is 27, and the size of the genome also happens to be 54. 50% of this assembly would be 10 + 9 + 8 = 27 (half the length of the sequence). Thus the N50=8, which is the size of the contig which, along with the larger contigs, contain half of sequence of a particular genome. Note: When comparing N50 values from different assemblies, the assembly sizes must be the same size in order for N50 to be meaningful.\nN50 can be described as a weighted median statistic such that 50% of the entire assembly is contained in contigs or scaffolds equal to or larger than this value.\nSection::::Definition.:L50.\nGiven a set of contigs, each with its own length, the \"L50\" count is defined as the smallest number of contigs whose length sum makes up half of genome size. From the example above the L50=3.\nSection::::Definition.:N90.\nThe N90 statistic is less than or equal to the \"N50\" statistic; it is the length for which the collection of all contigs of that length or longer contains at least 90% of the sum of the lengths of all contigs, and for which the collection of all contigs of that length or shorter contains at least 10% of the sum of the lengths of all contigs.\nSection::::Definition.:NG50.\nNote that \"N50\" is calculated in the context of the assembly size rather than the genome size. Therefore, comparisons of N50 values derived from assemblies of significantly different lengths are usually not informative, even if for the same genome. To address this, the authors of the Assemblathon competition came up with a new measure called \"NG50\". The NG50 statistic is the same as \"N50\" except that it is 50% of the known or estimated genome size that must be of the NG50 length or longer. This allows for meaningful comparisons between different assemblies. In the typical case that the assembly size is not more than the genome size, the NG50 statistic will not be more than the N50 statistic.\nSection::::Definition.:D50.\nThe D50 statistic (also termed D50 test) is similar to the \"N50\" statistic in definition though it is generally not used to describe genome assemblies. The \"D50\" statistic is the lowest value \"d\" for which the sum of the lengths of the largest \"d\" lengths is at least 50% of the sum of all of the lengths.\nSection::::Definition.:U50.\n\"U50\" is the length of the smallest contig such that 50% of the sum of all unique, target-specific contigs is contained in contigs of size U50 or larger.\nSection::::Definition.:UL50.\n\"UL50\" is the number of contigs whose length sum produces U50.\nSection::::Definition.:UG50.\n\"UG50\" is the length of the smallest contig such that 50% of the reference genome is contained in unique, target-specific contigs of size UG50 or larger.\nSection::::Definition.:UG50%.\n\"UG50%\" is the estimated percent coverage length of the UG50 in direct relation to the length of the reference genome.

The RMSD of two aligned structures indicates their divergence from one another. Structural alignment can be complicated by the existence of multiple protein domains within one or more of the input structures, because changes in relative orientation of the domains between two structures to be aligned can artificially inflate the RMSD.\n\nThe minimum information produced from a successful structural alignment is a set of residues that are considered equivalent between the structures. This set of equivalences is then typically used to superpose the three-dimensional coordinates for each input structure. (Note that one input element may be fixed as a reference and therefore its superposed coordinates do not change.) The fitted structures can be used to calculate mutual RMSD values, as well as other more sophisticated measures of structural similarity such as the global distance test (GDT, the metric used in CASP). The structural alignment also implies a corresponding one-dimensional sequence alignment from which a sequence identity, or the percentage of residues that are identical between the input structures, can be calculated as a measure of how closely the two sequences are related.\n\nBecause protein structures are composed of amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common protein backbone, a number of different possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein macromolecule can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the peptide bond. For simplicity and efficiency, often only the alpha carbon positions are considered, since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side-chain atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein backbone but also the rotameric states of the side chains.

Real-time systems, as well as their deadlines, are classified by the consequence of missing a deadline:\n\n- \"Hard\" missing a deadline is a total system failure.\n- \"Firm\" infrequent deadline misses are tolerable, but may degrade the system's quality of service.

The particular criteria optimized depend on the application, but some typical examples include maximizing the number of deadlines met, minimizing the lateness of tasks and maximizing the number of high priority tasks meeting their deadlines.\n\nHard real-time systems are used when it is imperative that an event be reacted to within a strict deadline. Such strong guarantees are required of systems for which not reacting in a certain interval of time would cause great loss in some manner, especially damaging the surroundings physically or threatening human lives (although the strict definition is simply that missing the deadline constitutes failure of the system).

Genetic algorithms are ideal for these types of problems where the search space is large and the number of feasible solutions is small."], "wikipedia-8446344": ["When designing a system, it is important to consider what the system should do when deadlines are not met. For example, an air-traffic control system constantly monitors hundreds of aircraft and makes decisions about incoming flight paths and determines the order in which aircraft should land based on data such as fuel, altitude, and speed. If any of this information is late, the result could be devastating. To address issues of obsolete data, the timestamp can support transactions by providing clear time references.\n\nIn real-time databases, deadlines are formed and different kinds of systems respond to data that does not meet its deadline in different ways. In a real-time system, each transaction uses a timestamp to schedule the transactions. A priority mapper unit assigns a level of importance to each transaction upon its arrival in the database system that is dependent on how the system views times and other priorities. The timestamp method relies on the arrival time in the system. Researchers indicate that for most studies, transactions are sporadic with unpredictable arrival times. For example, the system gives an earlier request deadline to a higher priority and a later deadline to a lower priority.\n\nThe type of response to a missed deadline depends on whether the deadline is hard, soft, or firm. Hard deadlines require that each data packet reach its destination before the packet has expired and if not, the process could be lost, causing a possible problem. Problems like these are not very common because omnipotence of the system is required before assigning deadlines to determine worst case. This is very hard to do and if something unexpected happens to the system such as a minute hardware glitch, it could throw the data off. For soft or firm deadlines, missing a deadline can lead to a degraded performance but not a catastrophe. A soft deadline meets as many deadlines as possible. However, no guarantee exists that the system can meet all deadlines. Should a transaction miss its deadline, the system has more flexibility and the transaction may increase in importance.\n\nHard deadline processes abort transactions that have passed the deadline, improving the system by cleaning out clutter that needs to be processed. Processes can clear out not only the transactions with expired deadlines but also transactions with the longest deadlines, assuming that once they reach the processor they would be obsolete. This means other transactions should be of higher priority. In addition, a system can remove the least critical transactions.\n\nThe goal of scheduling periods and deadlines is to update transactions guaranteed to complete before their deadline in such a way that the workload is minimal."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Most RTOSs use a pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.\nA key characteristic of an RTOS is the level of its consistency concerning the amount of time it takes to accept and complete an application's task; the variability is 'jitter'. A 'hard' real-time operating system has less jitter than a 'soft' real-time operating system. The chief design goal is not high throughput, but rather a guarantee of a soft or hard performance category. An RTOS that can usually or generally meet a deadline is a soft real-time OS, but if it can meet a deadline deterministically it is a hard real-time OS.\nAn RTOS has an advanced algorithm for scheduling.

Key factors in a real-time OS are minimal interrupt latency and minimal thread switching latency; a real-time OS is valued more for how quickly or how predictably it can respond than for the amount of work it can perform in a given period of time."], "wikipedia-25767": ["Real-time programs must guarantee response within specified time constraints, often referred to as \"deadlines\". The correctness of these types of systems depends on their temporal aspects as well as their functional aspects. Real-time responses are often understood to be in the order of milliseconds, and sometimes microseconds. A system not specified as operating in real time cannot usually \"guarantee\" a response within any timeframe, although \"typical\" or \"expected\" response times may be given.\n\nReal-time processing \"fails\" if not completed within a specified deadline relative to an event; deadlines must always be met, regardless of system load.\n\nA system is said to be \"real-time\" if the total correctness of an operation depends not only upon its logical correctness, but also upon the time in which it is performed. Real-time systems, as well as their deadlines, are classified by the consequence of missing a deadline:\nBULLET::::- \"Hard\" missing a deadline is a total system failure.\nBULLET::::- \"Firm\" infrequent deadline misses are tolerable, but may degrade the system's quality of service. The usefulness of a result is zero after its deadline.\nBULLET::::- \"Soft\" the usefulness of a result degrades after its deadline, thereby degrading the system's quality of service.\n\nThus, the goal of a \"hard real-time system\" is to ensure that all deadlines are met, but for \"soft real-time systems\" the goal becomes meeting a certain subset of deadlines in order to optimize some application-specific criteria. The particular criteria optimized depend on the application, but some typical examples include maximizing the number of deadlines met, minimizing the lateness of tasks and maximizing the number of high priority tasks meeting their deadlines."], "wikipedia-13957150": ["BULLET::::- Temporal Constraints\u2013the time window to complete the task\nBULLET::::- Procedural Constraints\u2013the order each task must be completed\nBULLET::::- Resource Constraints - is the resource available\nBULLET::::- A set of objectives to evaluate the scheduling performance\n\nIn very complex problems such as scheduling there is no known way to get to a final answer, so we resort to searching for it trying to find a \u201cgood\u201d answer. Scheduling problems most often use heuristic algorithms to search for the optimal solution. Heuristic search methods suffer as the inputs become more complex and varied. This type of problem is known in computer science as an NP-Hard problem. This means that there are no known algorithms for finding an optimal solution in polynomial time.\n\nAs we increase the number of objectives we are trying to achieve we also increase the number of constraints on the problem and similarly increase the complexity. Genetic algorithms are ideal for these types of problems where the search space is large and the number of feasible solutions is small.\n\nWe let this process continue either for a pre-allotted time or until we find a solution that fits our minimum criteria. Overall each successive generation will have a greater average fitness, i.e. taking less time with higher quality than the preceding generations. In scheduling problems, as with other genetic algorithm solutions, we must make sure that we do not select offspring that are infeasible, such as offspring that violate our precedence constraint. We of course may have to add further fitness values such as minimizing costs; however, each constraint that we add greatly increases the search space and lowers the number of solutions that are good matches."], "wikipedia-8446344": ["In real-time databases, deadlines are formed and different kinds of systems respond to data that does not meet its deadline in different ways. In a real-time system, each transaction uses a timestamp to schedule the transactions. A priority mapper unit assigns a level of importance to each transaction upon its arrival in the database system that is dependent on how the system views times and other priorities. The timestamp method relies on the arrival time in the system. Researchers indicate that for most studies, transactions are sporadic with unpredictable arrival times. For example, the system gives an earlier request deadline to a higher priority and a later deadline to a lower priority. Below is a comparison of different scheduling algorithms.\nBULLET::::- Earliest Deadline:\"PT = DT\" \u2014 The value of a transaction is not important. An example is a group of people calling to order a product.\nBULLET::::- Highest Value:\"PT = 1/VT\" \u2014 The deadline is not important. Some transactions should get to CPU based on criticalness, not fairness. This is an example of least slack that can wait the least amount of time. If the telephone switchboards were overloaded, people who call 911 should get priority.\nBULLET::::- Value inflated deadline:\"PT = DT/VT\" \u2014 Gives equal weight to deadline and values based on scheduling. An example is registering for classes where the student selects a block of classes that he wishes to take and presses submit. In this scenario, higher priorities often take up precedence. A school registration system probably uses this technique when the server receives two registration transactions. If one student had 22 credits and the other had 100 credits, the person with 100 credits would take priority (Value based scheduling).\n\nThe type of response to a missed deadline depends on whether the deadline is hard, soft, or firm. Hard deadlines require that each data packet reach its destination before the packet has expired and if not, the process could be lost, causing a possible problem. Problems like these are not very common because omnipotence of the system is required before assigning deadlines to determine worst case. This is very hard to do and if something unexpected happens to the system such as a minute hardware glitch, it could throw the data off. For soft or firm deadlines, missing a deadline can lead to a degraded performance but not a catastrophe. A soft deadline meets as many deadlines as possible. However, no guarantee exists that the system can meet all deadlines. Should a transaction miss its deadline, the system has more flexibility and the transaction may increase in importance. Below is a description of these responses:\nBULLET::::- Hard deadline: If not meeting deadlines creates problems, a hard deadline is best. It is periodic, meaning that it enters the database on a regular rhythmic pattern. An example is data gathered by a sensor. These are often used in life critical systems.\nBULLET::::- Firm deadline: Firm deadlines appear to be similar to hard deadlines yet they differ from hard deadlines because firm deadlines measure how important it is to complete the transaction at some point after the transaction arrives. Sometimes completing a transaction after its deadline has expired may be harmful or not helpful, and both the firm and hard deadlines consider this. An example of a firm deadline is an autopilot system.\nBULLET::::- Soft deadline: If meeting time constrains is desirable but missing deadlines do not cause serious damage, a soft deadline may be best. It operates on an aperiodic or irregular schedule. In fact, the arrival of each time for each task is unknown. An example is an operator switchboard for a telephone."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-26123": 3, "wikipedia-46473082": 1, "wikipedia-15735043": 1, "wikipedia-3098816": 1, "wikipedia-25767": 2, "wikipedia-46755114": 1, "wikipedia-13957150": 2, "wikipedia-8446344": 2, "wikipedia-192263": 1, "wikipedia-12291165": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-26123": 3, "wikipedia-46473082": 1, "wikipedia-15735043": 1, "wikipedia-3098816": 1, "wikipedia-25767": 3, "wikipedia-46755114": 1, "wikipedia-13957150": 3, "wikipedia-8446344": 3, "wikipedia-192263": 1, "wikipedia-12291165": 1}}}

A program with high test coverage, measured as a percentage, has had more of its source code executed during testing, which suggests it has a lower chance of containing undetected software bugs compared to a program with low test coverage. Many different metrics can be used to calculate test coverage; some of the most basic are the percentage of program subroutines and the percentage of program statements called during execution of the test suite.\n\nTo measure what percentage of code has been exercised by a test suite, one or more \"coverage criteria\" are used. Coverage criteria are usually defined as rules or requirements, which a test suite needs to satisfy.\n\nThere are a number of coverage criteria, the main ones being:\n- Function coverageHas each function (or subroutine) in the program been called?\n- Statement coverageHas each statement in the program been executed?\n- Edge coveragehas every edge in the Control flow graph been executed?\n- Branch coverageHas each branch (also called DD-path) of each control structure (such as in \"if\" and \"case\" statements) been executed? For example, given an \"if\" statement, have both the true and false branches been executed? Notice that this one is a subset of Edge coverage.\n- Condition coverage (or predicate coverage)Has each Boolean sub-expression evaluated both to true and false?\n\nFault injection may be necessary to ensure that all conditions and branches of exception handling code have adequate coverage during testing.\n\nCondition/decision coverage requires that both decision and condition coverage be satisfied. However, for safety-critical applications (e.g., for avionics software) it is often required that modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC) be satisfied. This criterion extends condition/decision criteria with requirements that each condition should affect the decision outcome independently.\n\nParameter value coverage (PVC) requires that in a method taking parameters, all the common values for such parameters be considered. The idea is that all common possible values for a parameter are tested. For example, common values for a string are: 1) null, 2) empty, 3) whitespace (space, tabs, newline), 4) valid string, 5) invalid string, 6) single-byte string, 7) double-byte string.

The common practice of allowing a 5-10 percent margin for late execution reduces the potential number of false negatives in test execution.

Test coverage is derived from design specifications and other requirements, such as safety standards or regulatory codes, where each requirement or specification of the design ideally will have one or more corresponding means of verification. Test coverage for different product life stages may overlap, but will not necessarily be exactly the same for all stages. For example, some requirements may be verified during Design Verification test, but not repeated during Acceptance test. Test coverage also feeds back into the design process, since the product may have to be designed to allow test access.\n\nSection::::Test plans.:Test methods.\nTest methods in the test plan state how test coverage will be implemented. Test methods may be determined by standards, regulatory agencies, or contractual agreement, or may have to be created new. Test methods also specify test equipment to be used in the performance of the tests and establish pass/fail criteria. Test methods used to verify hardware design requirements can range from very simple steps, such as visual inspection, to elaborate test procedures that are documented separately.\n\nSection::::Test plans.:Test responsibilities.\nTest responsibilities include what organizations will perform the test methods and at each stage of the product life. This allows test organizations to plan, acquire or develop test equipment and other resources necessary to implement the test methods for which they are responsible.

One outcome of a successful test plan should be a record or report of the verification of all design specifications and requirements as agreed upon by all parties.\n\nSection::::IEEE 829 test plan structure.\nIEEE 829-2008, also known as the 829 Standard for Software Test Documentation, is an IEEE standard that specifies the form of a set of documents for use in defined stages of software testing, each stage potentially producing its own separate type of document. These stages are:\nBULLET::::- Test plan identifier\nBULLET::::- Introduction\nBULLET::::- Test items\nBULLET::::- Features to be tested\nBULLET::::- Features not to be tested\nBULLET::::- Approach\nBULLET::::- Item pass/fail criteria\nBULLET::::- Suspension criteria and resumption requirements\nBULLET::::- Test deliverables\nBULLET::::- Testing tasks\nBULLET::::- Environmental needs\nBULLET::::- Responsibilities\nBULLET::::- Staffing and training needs\nBULLET::::- Schedule\nBULLET::::- Risks and contingencies\nBULLET::::- Approvals"], "wikipedia-7030": ["Section::::Coverage criteria.:Basic coverage criteria.\nThere are a number of coverage criteria, the main ones being:\nBULLET::::- Function coverageHas each function (or subroutine) in the program been called?\nBULLET::::- Statement coverageHas each statement in the program been executed?\nBULLET::::- Edge coveragehas every edge in the Control flow graph been executed?\nBULLET::::- Branch coverageHas each branch (also called DD-path) of each control structure (such as in \"if\" and \"case\" statements) been executed? For example, given an \"if\" statement, have both the true and false branches been executed? Notice that this one is a subset of Edge coverage.\nBULLET::::- Condition coverage (or predicate coverage)Has each Boolean sub-expression evaluated both to true and false?\nFor example, consider the following C function:\nAssume this function is a part of some bigger program and this program was run with some test suite. \nBULLET::::- If during this execution function 'foo' was called at least once, then \"function coverage\" for this function is satisfied.\nBULLET::::- \"Statement coverage\" for this function will be satisfied if it was called e.g. as codice_1, as in this case, every line in the function is executed including codice_2.\nBULLET::::- Tests calling codice_1 and codice_4 will satisfy \"branch coverage\" because, in the first case, both codice_5 conditions are met and codice_2 is executed, while in the second case, the first condition codice_7 is not satisfied, which prevents executing codice_2.\nBULLET::::- \"Condition coverage\" can be satisfied with tests that call codice_9 and codice_4. These are necessary because in the first cases, codice_7 evaluates to codice_12, while in the second, it evaluates codice_13. At the same time, the first case makes codice_14 codice_13, while the second makes it codice_12.\nCondition coverage does not necessarily imply branch coverage. For example, consider the following fragment of code:\nCondition coverage can be satisfied by two tests:\nBULLET::::- codice_17, codice_18\nBULLET::::- codice_19, codice_20\nHowever, this set of tests does not satisfy branch coverage since neither case will meet the codice_5 condition.\nFault injection may be necessary to ensure that all conditions and branches of exception handling code have adequate coverage during testing.\nSection::::Coverage criteria.:Modified condition/decision coverage.\nA combination of function coverage and branch coverage is sometimes also called\ndecision coverage. This criterion requires that every point of entry and exit in the program has been invoked at least once, and every decision in the program has taken on all possible outcomes at least once. In this context the decision is a boolean expression composed of conditions and zero or more boolean operators. This definition is not the same as branch coverage, however, some do use the term \"decision coverage\" as a synonym for \"branch coverage\".\nCondition/decision coverage requires that both decision and condition coverage be satisfied. However, for safety-critical applications (e.g., for avionics software) it is often required that modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC) be satisfied. This criterion extends condition/decision criteria with requirements that each condition should affect the decision outcome independently. For example, consider the following code:\nThe condition/decision criteria will be satisfied by the following set of tests:\nBULLET::::- a=true, b=true, c=true\nBULLET::::- a=false, b=false, c=false\nHowever, the above tests set will not satisfy modified condition/decision coverage, since in the first test, the value of 'b' and in the second test the value of 'c' would not influence the output. So, the following test set is needed to satisfy MC/DC:\nBULLET::::- a=false, b=true, c=false\nBULLET::::- a=false, b=true, c=true\nBULLET::::- a=false, b=false, c=true\nBULLET::::- a=true, b=false, c=true\nSection::::Coverage criteria.:Multiple condition coverage.\nThis criterion requires that all combinations of conditions inside each decision are tested. For example, the code fragment from the previous section will require eight tests:\nBULLET::::- a=false, b=false, c=false\nBULLET::::- a=false, b=false, c=true\nBULLET::::- a=false, b=true, c=false\nBULLET::::- a=false, b=true, c=true\nBULLET::::- a=true, b=false, c=false\nBULLET::::- a=true, b=false, c=true\nBULLET::::- a=true, b=true, c=false\nBULLET::::- a=true, b=true, c=true\nSection::::Coverage criteria.:Parameter value coverage.\nParameter value coverage (PVC) requires that in a method taking parameters, all the common values for such parameters be considered. \nThe idea is that all common possible values for a parameter are tested. For example, common values for a string are: 1) null, 2) empty, 3) whitespace (space, tabs, newline), 4) valid string, 5) invalid string, 6) single-byte string, 7) double-byte string. It may also be appropriate to use very long strings. Failure to test each possible parameter value may leave a bug. Testing only one of these could result in 100% code coverage as each line is covered, but as only one of seven options are tested, there is only 14.2% PVC.\nSection::::Coverage criteria.:Other coverage criteria.\nThere are further coverage criteria, which are used less often:\nBULLET::::- Linear Code Sequence and Jump (LCSAJ) coverage a.k.a. JJ-Path coverage has every LCSAJ/JJ-path been executed?\nBULLET::::- Path coverageHas every possible route through a given part of the code been executed?\nBULLET::::- Entry/exit coverageHas every possible call and return of the function been executed?\nBULLET::::- Loop coverageHas every possible loop been executed zero times, once, and more than once?\nBULLET::::- State coverageHas each state in a finite-state machine been reached and explored?\nBULLET::::- Data-flow coverageHas each variable definition and its usage been reached and explored?"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-22512989": 1, "wikipedia-2965801": 1, "wikipedia-357881": 3, "wikipedia-528249": 1, "wikipedia-1584125": 1, "wikipedia-13825312": 1, "wikipedia-7030": 3, "wikipedia-39289": 1, "wikipedia-21789602": 1, "wikipedia-178362": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-22512989": 1, "wikipedia-2965801": 1, "wikipedia-357881": 3, "wikipedia-528249": 1, "wikipedia-1584125": 2, "wikipedia-13825312": 1, "wikipedia-7030": 3, "wikipedia-39289": 1, "wikipedia-21789602": 1, "wikipedia-178362": 1}}}

For example, a string of three bits can represent up to eight distinct values as illustrated in Table 1.\nAs the number of bits composing a string increases, the number of possible \"0\" and \"1\" combinations increases exponentially. While a single bit allows only two value-combinations and two bits combined can make four separate values and so on. The amount of possible combinations doubles with each binary digit added as illustrated in Table 2.\nGroupings with a specific number of bits are used to represent varying things and have specific names.\nA \"byte\" is a bit string containing the number of bits needed to represent a character. On most modern computers, this is an eight bit string. Because the definition of a byte is related to the number of bits composing a character, some older computers have used a different bit length for their byte. In many computer architectures, the byte is used to address specific areas of memory. For example, even though 64-bit processors may address memory sixty-four bits at a time, they may still split that memory into eight-bit pieces. This is called byte-addressable memory. Historically, many CPUs read data in some multiple of eight bits. Because the byte size of eight bits is so common, but the definition is not standardized, the term octet is sometimes used to explicitly describe an eight bit sequence.\nA \"nibble\" (sometimes \"nybble\"), is a number composed of four bits. Being a half-byte, the nibble was named as a play on words. A person may need several nibbles for one bite from something; similarly, a nybble is a part of a byte. Because four bits allow for sixteen values, a nibble is sometimes known as a hexadecimal digit."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-148285": 3, "wikipedia-80733": 1, "wikipedia-2572877": 1, "wikipedia-23592304": 1, "wikipedia-300127": 1, "wikipedia-14794": 1, "wikipedia-15046": 1, "wikipedia-2507344": 1, "wikipedia-43026": 1, "wikipedia-48662": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-148285": 3, "wikipedia-80733": 2, "wikipedia-2572877": 1, "wikipedia-23592304": 1, "wikipedia-300127": 1, "wikipedia-14794": 2, "wikipedia-15046": 1, "wikipedia-2507344": 1, "wikipedia-43026": 1, "wikipedia-48662": 2}}}

If the current bit of the multiplier is 1, add the multiplicand into the accumulator; if it is 0, do nothing.\nFor an \"n\"-bit multiplier, this will take \"n\" clock cycles (where each cycle does either a shift or a shift-and-add).\nTo convert this into an algorithm for modular multiplication, with a modulus \"r\", it is necessary to subtract \"r\" conditionally at each stage:\nBULLET::::1. Double the contents of the accumulator.\nBULLET::::2. If the result is greater than or equal to \"r\", subtract \"r\". (Equivalently, subtract \"r\" from the accumulator and store the result back into the accumulator if and only if it is non-negative).\nBULLET::::3.

If the result of the addition is greater than or equal to \"r\", subtract \"r\". If no addition took place, do nothing.\nThis algorithm works. However, it is critically dependent on the speed of addition.\nNon-modular multiplication can make use of carry-save adders, which save time by storing the carries from each digit position and using them later: for example, by computing 111111111111+000000000010 as 111111111121 instead of waiting for the carry to propagate through the whole number to yield the true binary value 1000000000001. That final propagation still has to be done to yield a binary result but this only needs to be done once at the very end of the multiplication.\nUnfortunately the modular multiplication method outlined above needs to know the magnitude of the accumulated value at every step, in order to decide whether to subtract \"r\": for example, if it needs to know whether the value in the accumulator is greater than 1000000000000, the carry-save representation 111111111121 is useless and needs to be converted to its true binary value for the comparison to be made.\nIt therefore seems that one can have \"either\" the speed of carry-save \"or\" modular multiplication, but not both.\nThe principle of the Kochanski algorithm is one of making guesses as to whether or not \"r\" should be subtracted, based on the most significant few bits of the carry-save value in the accumulator. Such a guess will be wrong some of the time, since there is no way of knowing whether latent carries in the less significant digits (which have not been examined) might not invalidate the result of the comparison. Thus:\nBULLET::::- A subtraction may not have been made when one was required. In that case the result in the accumulator is greater than \"r\" (although the algorithm doesn't know it yet), and so after the next shift left, 2\"r\" will need to be subtracted from the accumulator.\nBULLET::::- A subtraction may have been made when one was not required. In that case the result in the accumulator is less than 0 (although the algorithm doesn't know it yet), and so after the next shift left, \"r\" or even 2\"r\" will need to be added back to the accumulator to make it positive again.\nWhat is happening is essentially a race between the errors that result from wrong guesses, which double with every shift left, and the corrections made by adding or subtracting multiples of \"r\" based on a guess of what the errors may be.\nIt turns out that examining the most significant 4 bits of the accumulator is sufficient to keep the errors within bounds and that the only values that need to be added to the accumulator are -2\"r\", -\"r\", 0, +\"r\", and +2\"r\", all of which can be generated instantaneously by simple shifts and negations."], "wikipedia-18584624": ["A redundant binary representation (RBR) is a numeral system that uses more bits than needed to represent a single binary digit so that most numbers have several representations. An RBR is unlike usual binary numeral systems, including two's complement, which use a single bit for each digit. Many of an RBR's properties differ from those of regular binary representation systems. Most importantly, an RBR allows addition without using a typical carry. When compared to non-redundant representation, an RBR makes bitwise logical operation slower, but arithmetic operations are faster when a greater bit width is used. Usually, each digit has its own sign that is not necessarily the same as the sign of the number represented. When digits have signs, that RBR is also a signed-digit representation.\n\nRedundant representations are commonly used inside high-speed arithmetic logic units.\n\nThe addition operation in all RBRs is carry-free, which means that the carry does not have to propagate through the full width of the addition unit. In effect, the addition in all RBRs is a constant-time operation. The addition will always take the same amount of time independently of the bit-width of the operands. This does not imply that the addition is always faster in an RBR than its two's complement equivalent, but that the addition will eventually be faster in an RBR with increasing bit width because the two's complement addition unit's delay is proportional to log(\"n\") (where \"n\" is the bit width).

Consequently, no file could be larger than 2 \u2212 1 bytes (4 GiB \u2212 1). In many implementations, the problem was exacerbated by treating the sizes as signed numbers, which further lowered the limit to 2 \u2212 1 bytes (2 GiB \u2212 1). Files that were too large for 32-bit operating systems to handle came to be known as \"large files\".\nWhile the limit was quite acceptable at a time when hard disks were smaller, the general increase in storage capacity combined with increased server and desktop file usage, especially for database and multimedia files, led to intense pressure for OS vendors to remove the limitation.\nIn 1996, multiple vendors responded by forming an industry initiative known as the Large File Summit, an obvious backronym of \"LFS\". The summit was tasked to define a standardized way to switch to 64-bit numbers to represent file sizes.\nMerely ensuring the sizes were treated as unsigned numbers would only increase the limit from 2 GiB\u22121 to 4 GiB\u22121, which would have been only a stopgap measure given the explosive growth in data storage. Nevertheless, Windows 95B / DOS 7.10 introduced an API extension (most notably an extended file open call) to access files up to the full 4 GiB\u22121 bytes possible on FAT16B and FAT32 volumes. Applications not aware of this extension continue to use the traditional file open call and were thereby still limited to a maximum of 2 GiB\u22121 bytes for backward compatibility.\nThis switch caused deployment issues and required design modifications, the consequences of which can still be seen:\nBULLET::::- The change to 64-bit file sizes frequently required incompatible changes to file system layout, which meant that large-file support sometimes necessitated a file system change. For example, Microsoft Windows' FAT32 file system does not support files larger than 4 GiB\u22121; one has to use NTFS instead. (Some alternative file system implementations support an extension named FAT32+, which supports file sizes up to 256 GiB\u22121 in a mostly backward compatible way, but this extension is not supported in mainstream operating systems so far.)\nBULLET::::- To support binary compatibility with old applications, operating system interfaces had to retain their use of 32-bit file sizes and new interfaces had to be designed specifically for large-file support.\nBULLET::::- To support writing portable code that makes use of LFS where possible, C standard library authors devised mechanisms that, depending on preprocessor constants, transparently redefined the functions to the 64-bit large-file aware ones.\nBULLET::::- Many old interfaces, especially C-based ones, explicitly specified argument types in a way that did not allow straightforward or transparent transition to 64-bit types. For example, the C functions codice_1 and codice_2 operate on file positions of type codice_3, which is typically 32 bits wide on 32-bit platforms, and cannot be made larger without sacrificing backward compatibility.

Further, the exponent is not represented directly, but a bias is added so that the smallest representable exponent is represented as 1, with 0 used for subnormal numbers. For numbers with an exponent in the normal range (the exponent field being not all ones or all zeros), the leading bit of the significand will always be 1. Consequently, a leading 1 can be implied rather than explicitly present in the memory encoding, and under the standard the explicitly represented part of the significand will lie between 0 and 1. This rule is called \"leading bit convention\", \"implicit bit convention\", or \"hidden bit convention\". This rule allows the binary format to have an extra bit of precision. The leading bit convention cannot be used for the subnormal numbers as they have an exponent outside the normal exponent range and scale by the smallest represented exponent as used for the smallest normal numbers.\nThe standard defines five basic formats that are named for their numeric base and the number of bits used in their interchange encoding. There are three binary floating-point basic formats (encoded with 32, 64 or 128 bits) and two decimal floating-point basic formats (encoded with 64 or 128 bits). The binary32 and binary64 formats are the \"single\" and \"double\" formats of IEEE 754-1985 respectively. A conforming implementation must fully implement at least one of the basic formats.\nThe standard also defines \"interchange formats\", which generalize these basic formats. For the binary formats, the leading bit convention is required. The following table summarizes the smallest interchange formats (including the basic ones).\nNote that in the table above, the minimum exponents listed are for normal numbers; the special subnormal number representation allows even smaller numbers to be represented (with some loss of precision). For example, the smallest positive number that can be represented in binary64 is 2; contributions to the \u22121074 figure include the E min value \u22121022 and all but one of the 53 significand bits (2 = 2).\nThe standard specifies extended and extendable precision formats, which are recommended for allowing a greater precision than that provided by the basic formats.

In 2003, 64-bit CPUs were introduced to the (formerly 32-bit) mainstream personal computer market in the form of x86-64 processors and the PowerPC G5, and were introduced in 2012 into the ARM architecture targeting smartphones and tablet computers, first sold on September 20, 2013, in the iPhone 5S powered by the ARMv8-A Apple A7 system on a chip (SoC).\nA 64-bit register can hold any of 2 (over 18 quintillion or 1.8\u00d710) different values.

Thistlethwaite's idea was to divide the problem into subproblems. Where algorithms up to that point divided the problem by looking at the parts of the cube that should remain fixed, he divided it by restricting the type of moves that could be executed. In particular he divided the cube group into the following chain of subgroups:\nNext he prepared tables for each of the right coset spaces formula_6. For each element he found a sequence of moves that took it to the next smaller group. After these preparations he worked as follows. A random cube is in the general cube group formula_7. Next he found this element in the right coset space formula_8. He applied the corresponding process to the cube. This took it to a cube in formula_9. Next he looked up a process that takes the cube to formula_10, next to formula_11 and finally to formula_12.\nAlthough the whole cube group formula_7 is very large (~4.3\u00d710), the right coset spaces formula_14 and formula_11 are much smaller.\nThe coset space formula_16 is the largest and contains only 1082565 elements. The number of moves required by this algorithm is the sum of the largest process in each step.\nInitially, Thistlethwaite showed that any configuration could be solved in at most 85 moves. In January 1980 he improved his strategy to yield a maximum of 80 moves. Later that same year, he reduced the number to 63, and then again to 52. By exhaustively searching the coset spaces it was later found that the worst possible number of moves for each stage was 7, 10, 13, and 15 giving a total of 45 moves at most.\nThistlethwaite's algorithm was improved by Herbert Kociemba in 1992.

Therefore, the goal of image quality assessment research is to design algorithms for objective assessment that are also consistent with subjective assessments. The development of such algorithms has a lot of potential applications. They can be used to monitor image quality in control quality systems, to benchmark image processing systems and algorithms and to optimize imaging systems."], "wikipedia-2534867": ["Objective video quality models are mathematical models that approximate results from subjective quality assessment, in which human observers are asked to rate the quality of a video. In this context, the term \"model\" may refer to a simple statistical model in which several independent variables (e.g. the packet loss rate on a network and the video coding parameters) are fit against results obtained in a subjective quality evaluation test using regression techniques. A model may also be a more complicated algorithm implemented in software or hardware.\n\nBULLET::::- Full Reference Methods (FR): FR models compute the quality difference by comparing the original video signal against the received video signal. Typically, every pixel from the source is compared against the corresponding pixel at the received video, with no knowledge about the encoding or transmission process in between. More elaborate algorithms may choose to combine the pixel-based estimation with other approaches such as described below. FR models are usually the most accurate at the expense of higher computational effort. As they require availability of the original video before transmission or coding, they cannot be used in all situations (e.g., where the quality is measured from a client device).\nBULLET::::- Reduced Reference Methods (RR): RR models extract some features of both videos and compare them to give a quality score. They are used when all the original video is not available, or when it would be practically impossible to do so, e.g. in a transmission with a limited bandwidth. This makes them more efficient than FR models at the expense of lower accuracy.\nBULLET::::- No-Reference Methods (NR): NR models try to assess the quality of a distorted video without any reference to the original signal. Due to the absence of an original signal, they may be less accurate than FR or RR approaches, but are more efficient to compute.\nBULLET::::- Pixel-Based Methods (NR-P): Pixel-based models use a decoded representation of the signal and analyze the quality based on the pixel information. Some of these evaluate specific degradation types only, such as blurring or other coding artifacts.\nBULLET::::- Parametric/Bitstream Methods (NR-B): These models make use of features extracted from the transmission container and/or video bitstream, e.g. MPEG-TS packet headers, motion vectors and quantization parameters. They do not have access to the original signal and require no decoding of the video, which makes them more efficient. In contrast to NR-P models, they have no access to the final decoded signal. However, the picture quality predictions they deliver are not very accurate.\nBULLET::::- Hybrid Methods (Hybrid NR-P-B): Hybrid models combine parameters extracted from the bitstream with a decoded video signal. They are therefore a mix between NR-P and NR-B models.\n\nThe most traditional ways of evaluating quality of digital video processing system (e.g. a video codec) are FR-based. Among the oldest FR metrics are signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which are calculated between every frame of the original and the degraded video signal. PSNR is the most widely used objective image quality metric, and the average PSNR over all frames can be considered a video quality metric. PSNR is also used often during video codec development in order to optimize encoders. However, PSNR values do not correlate well with perceived picture quality due to the complex, highly non-linear behavior of the human visual system.\n\nWith the success of digital video, a large number of more precise FR metrics have been developed. These metrics are inherently more complex than PSNR, and need more computational effort to calculate predictions of video quality. Among those metrics specifically developed for video are VQM and the MOVIE Index.\n\nThe popular Structural Similarity (SSIM) image quality metric is also often used for estimating video quality, which has led to a Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards in 2015. Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) \u2013 also an image quality metric \u2013 is a core element of the Netflix Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF), a tool that combines existing metrics to predict video quality.

ESP is an example of an output agreement game.\nSection::::Game Design Principles.:\"Inversion Problem Games\".\nGiven an image, the ESP Game can be used to determine what objects are in the image, but cannot be used to determine the location of the object in the image. Location information is necessary for training and testing computer vision algorithms, so the data collected by the ESP Game is not sufficient. Thus, to deal with this problem, a new type of microtask game known as inversion problem games were introduced by creator of ESP, von Ahn in 2006. Peekaboom extended upon ESP and had players associate labels with a specific region of an image. In inversion problem games, two players are randomly paired together. One is assigned as the describer and the other is the guesser. The describer is given an input, which the guesser must reproduce given hints from the describer. In Peekaboom, for example, the describer slowly reveals small sections of an image until the guesser correctly guesses the label provided to the describer.\nSection::::Game Design Principles.:\"Input Agreement Games\".\nIn input-agreement games two randomly paired players are each given an input that is hidden from the other player. Player inputs will either match or be different. The goal of these games is for players to tag their input such that the other player can determine whether or not the two inputs match. In 2008, Edith L. M. Law created the input-agreement game called TagATune. In this game, players label sound clips. In TagATune, players describe sound clips and guess if their partner's sound clip is the same as their own given their partner's tags.\nSection::::Game Design Principles.:\"Macrotask Games\".\nMacrotask games, unlike microtask games, contain complex problems that are usually left to experts to solve. In 2008, a macrotask game called Foldit was created by Seth Cooper. The idea was that players would attempt to fold a three-dimensional representation of a protein. This task was a hard problem for computers to automate completely. Locating the biologically relevant native conformation of a protein is a difficult computational challenge given the very large size of the search space.

This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between the bosons and fermions. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa.\nThere are several versions of superstring theory: type I, type IIA, type IIB, and two flavors of heterotic string theory ( and ). The different theories allow different types of strings, and the particles that arise at low energies exhibit different symmetries. For example, the type I theory includes both open strings (which are segments with endpoints) and closed strings (which form closed loops), while types IIA, IIB and heterotic include only closed strings."], "wikipedia-277468": ["A simpler \"one body\" model, the \"central-force problem\", treats one object as the immobile source of a force acting on other. One then seeks to predict the motion of the single remaining mobile object. Such an approximation can give useful results when one object is much more massive than the other (as with a light planet orbiting a heavy star, where the star can be treated as essentially stationary).\n\nHowever, the one-body approximation is usually unnecessary except as a stepping stone. For many forces, including gravitational ones, the general version of the two-body problem can be reduced to a pair of one-body problems, allowing it to be solved completely, and giving a solution simple enough to be used effectively.\n\nBy contrast, the three-body problem (and, more generally, the \"n\"-body problem for \"n\" \u2265 3) cannot be solved in terms of first integrals, except in special cases."], "wikipedia-20406": ["There are several versions of string theory: type I, type IIA, type IIB, and two flavors of heterotic string theory ( and ).

ESP is an example of an output agreement game.\nSection::::Game Design Principles.:\"Inversion Problem Games\".\nGiven an image, the ESP Game can be used to determine what objects are in the image, but cannot be used to determine the location of the object in the image. Location information is necessary for training and testing computer vision algorithms, so the data collected by the ESP Game is not sufficient. Thus, to deal with this problem, a new type of microtask game known as inversion problem games were introduced by creator of ESP, von Ahn in 2006. Peekaboom extended upon ESP and had players associate labels with a specific region of an image. In inversion problem games, two players are randomly paired together. One is assigned as the describer and the other is the guesser. The describer is given an input, which the guesser must reproduce given hints from the describer. In Peekaboom, for example, the describer slowly reveals small sections of an image until the guesser correctly guesses the label provided to the describer.\nSection::::Game Design Principles.:\"Input Agreement Games\".\nIn input-agreement games two randomly paired players are each given an input that is hidden from the other player. Player inputs will either match or be different. The goal of these games is for players to tag their input such that the other player can determine whether or not the two inputs match. In 2008, Edith L. M. Law created the input-agreement game called TagATune. In this game, players label sound clips. In TagATune, players describe sound clips and guess if their partner's sound clip is the same as their own given their partner's tags.\nSection::::Game Design Principles.:\"Macrotask Games\".\nMacrotask games, unlike microtask games, contain complex problems that are usually left to experts to solve. In 2008, a macrotask game called Foldit was created by Seth Cooper. The idea was that players would attempt to fold a three-dimensional representation of a protein. This task was a hard problem for computers to automate completely. Locating the biologically relevant native conformation of a protein is a difficult computational challenge given the very large size of the search space. By gamification and implementation of user friendly versions of algorithms, players are able to perform this complex task without much knowledge of biology."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-644671": 1, "wikipedia-362983": 1, "wikipedia-1180800": 1, "wikipedia-28305": 2, "wikipedia-277468": 1, "wikipedia-2336224": 1, "wikipedia-20406": 2, "wikipedia-18689983": 2, "wikipedia-288044": 1, "wikipedia-1300939": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-644671": 1, "wikipedia-362983": 1, "wikipedia-1180800": 1, "wikipedia-28305": 3, "wikipedia-277468": 2, "wikipedia-2336224": 1, "wikipedia-20406": 3, "wikipedia-18689983": 3, "wikipedia-288044": 1, "wikipedia-1300939": 1}}}

Certain concepts for multidimensional signal processing vary from one dimensional signal processing. For example, The computational complexity for multi-dimensional case is higher as it involves more dimensions. Also, assumptions of causality do not hold good for the multi-dimensional case.\n\nThere is a difference between 1-D and M-D digital filter design problems. In the 1-D case, the filter design and filter implementation issues are distinct and decoupled. The 1-D filter can first be designed and then particular network structure can be determined through the appropriate manipulation of the transfer function. In the case of M-D filter design, the multidimensional polynomials cannot be factored in general. This means that an arbitrary transfer function can generally not be manipulated into a form required by a particular implementation. This makes the design and implementation of M-D filters more complex than the 1-D filters.\n\nAlthough multidimensional difference equations represent a generalization of 1-D difference equations, they are considerably more complex and quite different. A number of important issues associated with multidimensional difference equations, such as the direction of recursion and the ordering relation, are really not an issue in the 1-D case.

Both of these examples use multiple sensors to sample signals and form images based on the manipulation of these multiple signals.\nProcessing in multi-dimension (m-D) requires more complex algorithms, compared to the 1-D case, to handle calculations such as the Fast Fourier Transform due to more degrees of freedom. In some cases, m-D signals and systems can be simplified into single dimension signal processing methods, if the considered systems are separable.\nTypically, multidimensional signal processing is directly associated with digital signal processing because its complexity warrants the use of computer modelling and computation.

The aiming point of the weapon is adjusted, and the process is repeated as necessary. Small caliber automatic weapons, either belt or magazine fed, may include a small amount of tracer ammunition (usually 5% or less) in with regular munitions, to facilitate the process under low-light conditions.\nThe main role of an artillery observer is to assist friendly artillery in accurately attacking a target.

Ryder. Ryder was a member of a group of academics in Oxford, England, the nascent animal rights community, now known as the Oxford Group. One of the group's activities was distributing pamphlets about areas of concern; the pamphlet titled \"Speciesism\" was written to protest against animal experimentation.\n\nRyder argued in the pamphlet that \"[s]ince Darwin, scientists have agreed that there is no 'magical' essential difference between humans and other animals, biologically-speaking. Why then do we make an almost total distinction morally? If all organisms are on one physical continuum, then we should also be on the same moral continuum.\" He wrote that, at that time in the UK, 5,000,000 animals were being used each year in experiments, and that attempting to gain benefits for our own species through the mistreatment of others was \"just 'speciesism' and as such it is a selfish emotional argument rather than a reasoned one\". Ryder used the term again in an essay, \"Experiments on Animals\", in \"Animals, Men and Morals\" (1971), a collection of essays on animal rights edited by philosophy graduate students Stanley and Roslind Godlovitch and John Harris, who were also members of the Oxford Group. Ryder wrote:\n\nIn as much as both \"race\" and \"species\" are vague terms used in the classification of living creatures according, largely, to physical appearance, an analogy can be made between them. Discrimination on grounds of race, although most universally condoned two centuries ago, is now widely condemned. Similarly, it may come to pass that enlightened minds may one day abhor \"speciesism\" as much as they now detest \"racism.\" The illogicality in both forms of prejudice is of an identical sort. If it is accepted as morally wrong to deliberately inflict suffering upon innocent human creatures, then it is only logical to also regard it as wrong to inflict suffering on innocent individuals of other species. ... The time has come to act upon this logic."], "wikipedia-1029178": ["Contextualist solution is not to deny any premise, nor to say that the argument does not follow, but link the truth value of (3) to the context, and say that we can refuse (3) in context\u2014like everyday conversational context\u2014where we have different requirements to say we know.\nThe main tenet of contextualist epistemology, no matter what account of knowledge it is wedded to, is that knowledge attributions are context-sensitive. Then the truth values of out term \"know\" depend on the context in which it is used . We can realize that in the context in which the standards to claim truthfully knowledge are so high\u2014e. e., in skeptical context\u2014if we said something like 'I know that I have hands' then this statement would be false. Nevertheless, if we utter the same proposition in an ordinary context\u2014e.g., in a cafe with friends--, where lower standards are in place , the statement would be truth, even more, its negation would be false. So, only when we participate in philosophical discourses of the skeptical sort, do we seem to lose our knowledge. However, once we leave the skeptical context, we can truthfully say we have knowledge.\nThat is, when we attribute knowledge to someone, the context in which we use the term 'knowledge' determines the standards relative to which \"knowledge\" is being attributed (or denied). If we use it in everyday conversational contexts, the contextualist maintains, most of our claims to \"know\" things are true, despite skeptic's attempts to show we know little or nothing. But if the term 'knowledge' is used when skeptical hypotheses are being discussed, we count as \"knowing\" very little, if anything. Contextualists use this to explain why skeptical arguments can be persuasive, while at the same time protecting the correctness of our ordinary claims to \"know\" things. It is important to note that this theory does not allow that someone can have knowledge at one moment and not the other, for this would hardly be a satisfying epistemological answer. What contextualism entails is that in one context an utterance of a knowledge attribution can be true, and in a context with higher standards for knowledge, the same statement can be false.

The basic concept of link-state routing is that every node constructs a \"map\" of the connectivity to the network, in the form of a graph, showing which nodes are connected to which other nodes. Each node then independently calculates the next best logical \"path\" from it to every possible destination in the network. Each collection of best paths will then form each node's routing table.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the first main stage in the link-state algorithm is to give a map of the network to every node. This is done with several subsidiary steps.\n\nFirst, each node needs to determine what other ports it is connected to, over fully working links; it does this using a \"reachability protocol\" which it runs periodically and separately with each of its directly connected neighbours.\n\nNext, each node periodically (and in case of connectivity changes) sends a short message, the link-state advertisement, which:\nBULLET::::- Identifies the node which is producing it.\nBULLET::::- Identifies all the other nodes (either routers or networks) to which it is directly connected.\nBULLET::::- Includes a 'sequence number', which increases every time the source node makes up a new version of the message\"\"\nThis message is sent to all the nodes on a network. As a necessary precursor, each node in the network remembers, for every one of \"its\" neighbors, the sequence number of the last link-state message which it received from that node. When a link-state advertisement is received at a node, the node looks up the sequence number it has stored for the source of that link-state message: if this message is newer (i.e., has a higher sequence number), it is saved, and a copy is sent in turn to each of that node's neighbors. This procedure rapidly gets a copy of the latest version of each node's link-state advertisement to every node in the network.\n\nFinally, with the complete set of link-state advertisements (one from each node in the network) in hand, each node produces the graph for the map of the network. \nThe algorithm iterates over the collection of link-state advertisements; for each one, it makes links on the map of the network, from the node which sent that message, to all the nodes which that message indicates are neighbors of the sending node.\nNo link is considered to have been correctly reported unless the two ends agree; i.e., if one node reports that it is connected to another, but the other node does not report that it is connected to the first, there is a problem, and the link is not included on the map.\n\nThe link-state message giving information about the neighbors is recomputed, and then flooded throughout the network, whenever there is a change in the connectivity between the node and its neighbors; e.g., when a link fails. Any such change will be detected by the reachability protocol which each node runs with its neighbors.\n\nEach node independently runs an algorithm over the map to determine the shortest path from itself to every other node in the network; generally some variant of Dijkstra's algorithm is used. This is based around a link cost across each path which includes available bandwidth among other things.\nA node maintains two data structures: a tree containing nodes which are \"done\", and a list of \"candidates\". The algorithm starts with both structures empty; it then adds to the first one the node itself. The variant of a Greedy Algorithm then repetitively does the following:\nBULLET::::- All neighbour nodes which are directly connected to the node are just added to the tree (excepting any nodes which are already in either the tree or the candidate list). The rest are added to the second (candidate) list.\nBULLET::::- Each node in the candidate list is compared to each of the nodes already in the tree. The candidate node which is closest to any of the nodes already in the tree is itself moved into the tree and attached to the appropriate neighbor node. When a node is moved from the candidate list into the tree, it is removed from the candidate list and is not considered in subsequent iterations of the algorithm.\nThe above two steps are repeated as long as there are any nodes left in the candidate list. (When there are none, all the nodes in the network will have been added to the tree.) This procedure ends with the tree containing all the nodes in the network, with the node on which the algorithm is running as the \"root\" of the tree. The shortest path from that node to any other node is indicated by the list of nodes one traverses to get from the root of the tree, to the desired node in the tree..!\n\nWith the shortest paths in hand, the next step is to fill in the routing table. For any given destination node, the best path for that destination is the node which is the first step from the root node, down the branch in the shortest-path tree which leads toward the desired destination node. To create the routing table, it is only necessary to walk the tree, remembering the identity of the node at the head of each branch, and filling in the routing table entry for each node one comes across with that identity."], "wikipedia-18116059": ["The starting curve is an ordered set of points or lines and the distance dimension \"\u03b5\"\u00a0\u00a00.\nThe algorithm recursively divides the line.

These probabilities may be determined analytically by solving a system of linear equations. After computing these probabilities for each pixel, the pixel is assigned to the label for which it is most likely to send a random walker. The image is modeled as a graph, in which each pixel corresponds to a node which is connected to neighboring pixels by edges, and the edges are weighted to reflect the similarity between the pixels.

To obtain the optimal solution with minimum computation and time, the problem is solved iteratively where in each iteration the solution moves closer to the optimum solution.

The process starts from trying to fit a linear regression model. If the P-value turns out to be low, then a higher degree polynomial regression, which is usually quadratic, will be implemented. The process of finding a good relationship between input and response variables will be done for each simulation test. In simulation optimization, response surface method can be used to find the best input variables that produce desired outcomes in terms of response variables.\nSection::::Simulation-based optimization methods.:Heuristic methods.\nHeuristic methods change accuracy by speed. Their goal is to find a good solution faster than the traditional methods, when they are too slow or fail in solving the problem. Usually they find local optimal instead of the optimal value; however, the values are considered close enough of the final solution. Examples of this kind of method is tabu search or Genetic algorithm.\nMetamodels enable researchers to obtain reliable approximate model outputs without running expensive and time-consuming computer simulations. Therefore, the process of model optimization can take less computation time and cost.\nSection::::Simulation-based optimization methods.:Stochastic approximation.\nStochastic approximation is used when the function cannot be computed directly, only estimated via noisy observations. In this scenarios, this method (or family of methods) looks for the extrema of these function.\nSection::::Simulation-based optimization methods.:Derivative-free optimization methods.\nDerivative-free optimization is a subject of mathematical optimization.

It combines artificial intelligence, simulation-base algorithms, and functional approach techniques.\nSection::::Limitations.\nSimulation based optimization has some limitations, such as the difficulty of creating a model that imitates the dynamic behavior of a system in a way that is considered good enough for its representation.

(This process will be described in more detail.)\nFunnelsort is similar to merge sort in that some number of subarrays are recursively sorted, after which a merging step combines the subarrays into one sorted array. Merging is performed by a device called a k-merger, which is described in the section below.\nSection::::Algorithm.:k-mergers.\nA k-merger takes formula_12 sorted sequences. Upon one invocation of a k-merger, it outputs the first formula_13 elements of the sorted sequence obtained by merging the k input sequences.\nAt the top level, funnelsort uses a formula_8-merger on formula_8 sequences of length formula_9, and invokes this merger once.\nThe k-merger is built recursively out of formula_17-mergers. It consists of formula_17 input formula_17-mergers formula_20, and a single output formula_17-merger formula_22.\nThe k inputs are separated into formula_17 sets of formula_17 inputs each. Each of these sets is an input to one of the input mergers. The output of each input merger is connected to a buffer, a FIFO queue that can hold formula_25 elements. The buffers are implemented as circular queues.\nThe outputs of the formula_17 buffers are connected to the inputs of the output merger formula_22. Finally, the output of formula_22 is the output of the entire k-merger.\nIn this construction, any input merger only outputs formula_29 items at once, but the buffer it outputs to has double the space. This is done so that an input merger can be called only when its buffer does not have enough items, but that when it is called, it outputs a lot of items at once (namely, formula_29 of them).\nA k-merger works recursively in the following way. To output formula_13 elements, it recursively invokes its output merger formula_29 times. However, before it makes a call to formula_22, it checks all of its buffers, filling each of them that are less than half full. To fill the i-th buffer, it recursively invokes the corresponding input merger formula_34 once. If this cannot be done (due to the merger running out of inputs), this step is skipped. Since this call outputs formula_29 elements, the buffer contains at least formula_29 elements.

As the number of entities increases, the number of interactions between them would increase exponentially, and it would get to a point where it would be impossible to know and understand all of them. Similarly, higher levels of complexity in software increase the risk of unintentionally interfering with interactions and so increases the chance of introducing defects when making changes.

However, social complexity and its emergent properties are central recurring themes throughout the historical development of social thought and the study of social change. The early founders of sociological theory, such as Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies, \u00c9mile Durkheim, Max Weber, Vilfredo Pareto, and Georg Simmel, all examined the exponential growth and increasing interrelatedness of social encounters and exchanges. This emphasis on interconnectivity in social relationships and the emergence of new properties within society is found in theoretical thinking in multiple areas of sociology. As a theoretical tool, social complexity theory serves as a basis for the connection of micro- and macro-level social phenomena, providing a meso-level or middle-range theoretical platform for hypothesis formation. Methodologically, the concept of social complexity is theory-neutral, meaning that it accommodates both local (micro) and global (macro) phenomena in sociological research."], "wikipedia-2915506": ["Integrative complexity is a research psychometric that refers to the degree to which thinking and reasoning involve the recognition and integration of multiple perspectives and possibilities and their interrelated contingencies.\nIntegrative complexity is a measure of the intellectual style used by individuals or groups in processing information, problem-solving, and decision making. Complexity looks at the structure of one's thoughts, while ignoring the contents. It is scorable from almost any verbal materials: written materials, such as books, articles, letters, and transcript; as well as audio-visual material.\nThe measure of integrative complexity has two components: differentiation and integration. Differentiation refers to the perception of different dimensions when considering an issue. Integration refers to the recognition of cognitive connections among differentiated dimensions or perspectives."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-7363": 2, "wikipedia-2814347": 1, "wikipedia-30699737": 1, "wikipedia-2792572": 1, "wikipedia-1462640": 1, "wikipedia-33674235": 1, "wikipedia-22538656": 1, "wikipedia-231202": 1, "wikipedia-984629": 1, "wikipedia-2915506": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-7363": 3, "wikipedia-2814347": 2, "wikipedia-30699737": 2, "wikipedia-2792572": 2, "wikipedia-1462640": 2, "wikipedia-33674235": 2, "wikipedia-22538656": 2, "wikipedia-231202": 1, "wikipedia-984629": 2, "wikipedia-2915506": 2}}}

Nursing practise was first described as a four-stage nursing process by Ida Jean Orlando in 1958. It should not be confused with nursing theories or health informatics. The diagnosis phase was added later.\nThe nursing process uses clinical judgement to strike a balance of epistemology between personal interpretation and research evidence in which critical thinking may play a part to categorize the clients issue and course of action. Nursing offers diverse patterns of knowing. Nursing knowledge has embraced pluralism since the 1970s.\nSection::::Phases.\nThe nursing process is goal-oriented method of caring that provides a framework to nursing care. It involves seven major steps:\nBULLET::::- A\nBULLET::::- D\nBULLET::::- O\nBULLET::::- P\nBULLET::::- I\nBULLET::::- R\nBULLET::::- E\nAccording to some theorists, this seven-steps description of the nursing process is outdated and misrepresents nursing as linear and atomic.\nSection::::Phases.:Assessing phase.\nThe nurse completes an holistic nursing assessment of the needs of the individual/family/community, regardless of the reason for the encounter. The nurse collects subjective data and objective data using a nursing framework, such as Marjory Gordon's functional health patterns.\nSection::::Phases.:Assessing phase.:Models for data collection.\nNursing assessments provide the starting point for determining nursing diagnoses. It is vital that a recognized nursing assessment framework is used in practice to identify the patient's* problems, risks and outcomes for enhancing health. The use of an evidence-based nursing framework such as Gordon's Functional Health Pattern Assessment should guide assessments that support nurses in determination of NANDA-I nursing diagnoses. For accurate determination of nursing diagnoses, a useful, evidence-based assessment framework is best practice.\nSection::::Phases.:Assessing phase.:Models for data collection.:Methods.\nBULLET::::- Client Interview\nBULLET::::- Physical Examination\nBULLET::::- Obtaining a health history (including dietary data)\nBULLET::::- Family history/report\nSection::::Phases.:Diagnosing phase.\nNursing diagnoses represent the nurse's clinical judgment about actual or potential health problems/life process occurring with the individual, family, group or community. The accuracy of the nursing diagnosis is validated when a nurse is able to clearly identify and link to the defining characteristics, related factors and/or risk factors found within the patients assessment. Multiple nursing diagnoses may be made for one client.\nSection::::Phases.:Planning phase.\nIn agreement with the client, the nurse addresses each of the problems identified in the diagnosing phase. When there are multiple nursing diagnoses to be addressed, the nurse prioritizes which diagnoses will receive the most attention first according to their severity and potential for causing more serious harm. The most common terminology for standardized nursing diagnosis is that of the evidence-based terminology developed and refined by NANDA International, the oldest and one of the most researched of all standardized nursing languages. For each problem a measurable goal/outcome is set. For each goal/outcome, the nurse selects nursing interventions that will help achieve the goal/outcome, which are aimed at the related factors (etiologies) not merely at symptoms (defining characteristics). A common method of formulating the expected outcomes is to use the evidence-based Nursing Outcomes Classification to allow for the use of standardized language which improves consistency of terminology, definition and outcome measures. The interventions used in the Nursing Interventions Classification again allow for the use of standardized language which improves consistency of terminology, definition and ability to identify nursing activities, which can also be linked to nursing workload and staffing indices. The result of this phase is a nursing care plan.\nSection::::Phases.:Implementing phase.\nThe nurse implements the nursing care plan, performing the determined interventions that were selected to help meet the goals/outcomes that were established. Delegated tasks and the monitoring of them is included here as well.\nActivities\nBULLET::::- pre-assessment of the client-done before just carrying out implementation to determine if it is relevant\nBULLET::::- determine need for assistance\nBULLET::::- implementation of nursing orders\nBULLET::::- delegating and supervising-determines who to carry out what action\nSection::::Phases.:Evaluating phase.\nThe nurse evaluates the progress toward the goals/outcomes identified in the previous phases. If progress towards the goal is slow, or if regression has occurred, the nurse must change the plan of care accordingly. Conversely, if the goal has been achieved then the care can cease. New problems may be identified at this stage, and thus the process will start all over again.\nSection::::Characteristics.\nThe nursing process is a cyclical and ongoing process that can end at any stage if the problem is solved. The nursing process exists for every problem that the individual/family/community has. The nursing process not only focuses on ways to improve physical needs, but also on social and emotional needs as well.\nThe entire process is recorded or documented in order to inform all members of the health care team."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This is where the first, most general, outline of what is required by the system is documented. This entails rough breakdown of the processes, actors, and data required for the system. These are what comprise the classes of the analysis.\nSection::::Walkthrough.:Description.\nOnce the general outline is completed, the next step is to describe the behavior of the system visible to the potential user of the system. While internal behaviors can be described as well, this is more related to designing a system rather than gathering requirements for it. The benefit of briefly describing internal behaviors would be to clarify with potential users that the system is not missing a vital component externally due to it being completed internally. The overall goal of this step is to provide just enough detail to understand what classes are required for the system. Too much detail can make it difficult to change the system later on.\nSection::::Walkthrough.:Analysis Classes.\nThis step narrows down the class list into those classes that are capable of performing the behavior needed to make the system function successfully. If no classes yet exist for a system, they must be created before this step can be completed. Classes can be created in many ways from many sources. A few examples are: previous\u2014but similar\u2014systems, enterprise models, and data mining. Once classes are created and narrowed down, relationships must be developed between classes, now called analysis classes, which model the task of the system.\nSection::::Walkthrough.:Responsibilities.\nFor each analysis class identified in the previous step, the responsibilities of the class must be detailed clearly. This will ensure that an individual class has a task to complete for which no other class in the system will also perform. The responsibilities of the different classes should not overlap.\nSection::::Walkthrough.:Associations.\nAfter detailing the responsibilities of each analysis class, the relationships between the classes must be clarified next. There are four parts of this step: \n1. Identify the classes to be used. \n2. Identify possible relationships between classes. \n3. For those with relationships, describe the nature of the relationship. \n4. If applicable, identify the multiplicity of the relationship, meaning determine how many of the first class correspond to one object in the second class of the relationship.\nView figure 1 for an example of associations between classes:\nIn this diagram, each box is a class and the lines linking them show which ones have relationships between them.\nSection::::Walkthrough.:Behavior.\nOnce the relationships between classes are understood, the next process is to detail the behavior the classes will exhibit and how they will interact in order to complete the system. This entails determining how the classes communicate and send messages along the timeline of the system process being developed. This is derived from the responsibilities of the classes previously identified. Determining what class the message goes to follows the associations set up in the previous step.\nSection::::Walkthrough.:Describe Attributes.\nThroughout the use case analysis so far, attributes of the classes and objects may have been discovered that are necessary for the classes to complete their tasks. These could be in the form of data variables or functions. Some of these attributes can be derived from the previous steps, while others are general assumptions from common knowledge (e.g. all operational modern-day computers have an operating system, a processor, and input/output devices).\nView figure 2 for an example on described attributes following the figure 1 diagram:\nThe attributes described in the diagram at this point are generally the items that become the data needed for the system/process to function properly.\nSection::::Walkthrough.:Mechanisms.\nThe final step is to identify components that provide a solution to the problem domain.

This systematic way of organizing, and gaining meaningful parts of data as it relates to the research question is called coding. The coding process evolves through an inductive analysis and is not considered to be a linear process, but a cyclical process in which codes emerge throughout the research process. This cyclical process involves going back and forth between phases of data analysis as needed until you are satisfied with the final themes. Researchers conducting thematic analysis should attempt to go beyond surface meanings of the data to make sense of the data and tell an accurate story of what the data means.\nThe coding process is rarely completed the first time. Each time, researchers should strive to refine codes by adding, subtracting, combining or splitting potential codes. Start codes are produced through terminology used by participants during the interview and can be used as a reference point of their experiences during the interview. Dependability increases when the researcher uses concrete codes that are based on dialogue and are descriptive in nature. These codes will facilitate the researcher's ability to locate pieces of data later in the process and identify why they included them. Initial coding sets the stage for detailed analysis later by allowing the researcher to reorganize the data according to the ideas that have been obtained throughout the process. Reflexivity journal entries for new codes serve as a reference point to the participant and their data section, reminding the researcher to understand why and where they will include these start codes in the final analysis. Throughout the coding process, full and equal attention needs to be paid to each data item because it will help in the identification of unnoticed repeated patterns. Coding for as many themes as possible and coding individual aspects of the data may seem irrelevant but can potentially be crucial later in the analysis process.\nCoding also involves the process of data reduction and complication. Reduction of codes is initiated by assigning tags or labels to the data set based on the research question(s). In this stage, condensing large data sets into smaller units permits further analysis of the data by creating useful categories. In-vivo codes are also produced by applying references and terminology from the participants in their interviews. Coding aids in development, transformation and re-conceptualization of the data and helps to find more possibilities for analysis. Researchers should ask questions related to the data and generate theories from the data, extending past what has been previously reported in previous research.\nSection::::Phases.:Phase 2: Generating initial codes.:Data reduction.\nCoding can be thought of as a means of reduction of data or data simplification. Using simple but broad analytic codes it is possible to reduce the data to a more manageable feat. In this stage of data analysis the analyst must focus on the identification of a more simple way of organizing data. using data reductionism researchers should include a process of indexing the data texts which could include: field notes, interview transcripts, or other documents. Data at this stage are reduced to classes or categories in which the researcher is able to identify segments of the data that share a common category or code. Siedel and Kelle (1995) suggest three ways to aid with the process of data reduction and coding: (a) noticing relevant phenomena, (b) collecting examples of the phenomena, and (c) analyzing phenomena to find similarities, differences, patterns and overlying structures. This aspect of data collection is important because during this stage researchers should be attaching codes to the data to allow the researcher to think about the data in different ways. Coding can not be viewed as strictly data reduction, data complication can be used as a way to open up the data to examine further. The below section addresses the process of data complication and its significance to data analysis in qualitative analysis.\nSection::::Phases.:Phase 2: Generating initial codes.:Data complication.\nThe process of creating codes can be described as both data reduction and data complication. Data complication can be described as going beyond the data and asking questions about the data to generate frameworks and theories. The complication of data is used to expand on data to create new questions and interpretation of the data. Researchers should make certain that the coding process does not lose more information than is gained. Tesch (1990) defines data complication as the process of reconceptualizing the data giving new contexts for the data segments. Data complication serves as a means of providing new contexts for the way data is viewed and analyzed.\nCoding is a process of breaking data up through analytical ways and in order to produce questions about the data, providing temporary answers about relationships within and among the data. Decontextualizing and recontextualizing help to reduce and expand the data in new ways with new theories.\nSection::::Phases.:Phase 3: Searching for themes.\nSearching for themes and considering what works and what does not work within themes enables the researcher to begin the analysis of potential codes. In this phase, it is important to begin by examining how codes combine to form over-reaching themes in the data. At this point, researchers have a list of themes and begin to focus on broader patterns in the data, combining coded data with proposed themes. Researchers also begin considering how relationships are formed between codes and themes and between different levels of existing themes. It may be helpful to use visual models to sort codes into the potential themes.\nThemes differ from codes in that themes are phrases or sentences that identifies what the data \"means\". They describe an outcome of coding for analytic reflection. Themes consist of ideas and descriptions within a culture that can be used to explain causal events, statements, and morals derived from the participants' stories. In subsequent phases, it is important to narrow down the potential themes to provide an overreaching theme. Thematic analysis allows for categories or themes to emerge from the data like the following: repeating ideas; indigenous terms, metaphors and analogies; shifts in topic; and similarities and differences of participants' linguistic expression. It is important at this point to address not only what is present in data, but also what is missing from the data. conclusion of this phase should yield many candidate themes collected throughout the data process. It is crucial to avoid discarding themes even if they are initially insignificant as they may be important themes later in the analysis process.\nSection::::Phases.:Phase 4: Reviewing themes.\nThis phase requires the researchers to search for data that supports or refutes the proposed theory. This allows for further expansion on and revision of themes as they develop. At this point, researchers should have a set of potential themes, as this phase is where the reworking of initial themes takes place. Some existing themes may collapse into each other, other themes may need to be condensed into smaller units.\nSpecifically, this phase involves two levels of refining and reviewing themes. Connections between overlapping themes may serve as important sources of information and can alert researchers to the possibility of new patterns and issues in the data. Deviations from coded material can notify the researcher that a code may not actually exist. Both of this acknowledgements should be noted in the researcher's reflexivity journal, also including the absence of themes. Codes serve as a way to relate data to a person's conception of that concept. At this point, the researcher should focus on interesting aspects of the codes and why they fit together.\nSection::::Phases.:Phase 4: Reviewing themes.:Level 1.\nReviewing coded data extracts allows researchers to identify if themes form coherent patterns. If this is the case, researchers should move onto Level 2. If themes do not form clear patterns, consideration of the potentially problematic themes should be considered in addition to determining if data does not fit into the theme. If themes are problematic, it is important to rework the theme and during the process, identification of new themes may emerge. For example, it is problematic when themes do not appear to work or a significant amount of overlap between themes exists. This can result in a weak or unconvincing analysis of the data. If this occurs, data may need to be recognized in order"], "wikipedia-2979782": ["While there are many formats for a lesson plan, most lesson plans contain some or all of these elements, typically in this order:\nBULLET::::- \"Title\" of the lesson\nBULLET::::- \"Time\" required to complete the lesson\nBULLET::::- List of required \"materials\"\nBULLET::::- List of \"objectives\", which may be \"behavioral objectives\" (what the student can \"do\" at lesson completion) or \"knowledge objectives\" (what the student \"knows\" at lesson completion)\nBULLET::::- The \"set\" (or lead-in, or bridge-in) that focuses students on the lesson's skills or concepts\u2014these include showing pictures or models, asking leading questions, or reviewing previous lessons\nBULLET::::- An \"instructional component\" that describes the sequence of events that make up the lesson, including the teacher's instructional input and, where appropriate, guided practice by students to consolidate new skills and ideas\nBULLET::::- \"Independent practice\" that allows students to extend skills or knowledge on their own\nBULLET::::- A \"summary\", where the teacher wraps up the discussion and answers questions\nBULLET::::- An \"evaluation\" component, a test for mastery of the instructed skills or concepts\u2014such as a set of questions to answer or a set of instructions to follow\nBULLET::::- A \"risk assessment\" where the lesson's risks and the steps taken to minimize them are documented\nBULLET::::- An \"analysis\" component the teacher uses to reflect on the lesson itself\u2014such as what worked and what needs improving\nBULLET::::- A \"continuity\" component reviews and reflects on content from the previous lesson\n\nAccording to Herbart, there are eight lesson plan phases that are designed to provide \"many opportunities for teachers to recognize and correct students' misconceptions while extending understanding for future lessons.\" These phases are: Introduction, Foundation, Brain Activation, Body of New Information, Clarification, Practice and Review, Independent Practice, and Closure.\nBULLET::::1.

Exons are the sections of DNA that contain the instruction set for generating a protein; they are interspersed with non-coding regions called introns. The introns are later removed before the protein is made, leaving only the coding exon regions.\nSplicing naturally occurs in pre-mRNA when introns are being removed to form mature-mRNA that consists solely of exons. Starting in the late 1990s, scientists realized they could take advantage of this naturally occurring cellular splicing to downplay genetic mutations into less harmful ones.\nThe mechanism behind exon skipping is a mutation specific antisense oligonucleotide (AON). An antisense oligonucleotide is a synthesized short nucleic acid polymer, typically fifty or fewer base pairs in length that will bind to the mutation site in the pre-messenger RNA, to induce exon skipping. The AON binds to the mutated exon, so that when the gene is then translated from the mature mRNA, it is \u201cskipped\u201d over, thus restoring the disrupted reading frame.

At each position codice_3 the algorithm first checks for equality of the first character in the word being searched, i.e. codice_10. If a match is found, the algorithm tests the other characters in the word being searched by checking successive values of the word position index, codice_11.

This latter test is what is avoided by using a sentinel value. Assuming the array can be extended by one element (without memory allocation or cleanup; this is more realistic for a linked list, as below), this can be rewritten as:\nint find(int arr[], size_t len, int val)\nIn this case each loop iteration only has a single test (for the value), and is guaranteed to terminate, due to the sentinel value.

For phrases like \"a huge difference,\" Wikipedia may provide measurable metrics (e.g., percentages, statistical significance, or historical trends) or contextual explanations to clarify the scale or nature of the difference. However, the exact answer would depend on the specific topic being referenced.", "wikipedia-597564": ["For many sensory modalities, over a wide range of stimulus magnitudes sufficiently far from the upper and lower limits of perception, the 'JND' is a fixed proportion of the reference sensory level, and so the ratio of the JND/reference is roughly constant (that is the JND is a constant proportion/percentage of the reference level). Measured in physical units, we have:\nwhere formula_2 is the original intensity of the particular stimulation, formula_3 is the addition to it required for the change to be perceived (the JND), and \"k\" is a constant. This rule was first discovered by Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795\u20131878), an anatomist and physiologist, in experiments on the thresholds of perception of lifted weights. A theoretical rationale (not universally accepted) was subsequently provided by Gustav Fechner, so the rule is therefore known either as the Weber Law or as the Weber\u2013Fechner law; the constant \"k\" is called the Weber constant. It is true, at least to a good approximation, of many but not all sensory dimensions, for example the brightness of lights, and the intensity and the pitch of sounds. It is not true, however, for the wavelength of light. Stanley Smith Stevens argued that it would hold only for what he called \"prothetic\" sensory continua, where change of input takes the form of increase in intensity or something obviously analogous; it would not hold for \"metathetic\" continua, where change of input produces a qualitative rather than a quantitative change of the percept. Stevens developed his own law, called Stevens' Power Law, that raises the stimulus to a constant power while, like Weber, also multiplying it by a constant factor in order to achieve the perceived stimulus.\nThe JND is a statistical, rather than an exact quantity: from trial to trial, the difference that a given person notices will vary somewhat, and it is therefore necessary to conduct many trials in order to determine the threshold. The JND usually reported is the difference that a person notices on 50% of trials. If a different proportion is used, this should be included in the description\u2014for example one might report the value of the \"75% JND\".\nModern approaches to psychophysics, for example signal detection theory, imply that the observed JND, even in this statistical sense, is not an absolute quantity, but will depend on situational and motivational as well as perceptual factors. For example, when a researcher flashes a very dim light, a participant may report seeing it on some trials but not on others.\nThe JND formula has an objective interpretation (implied at the start of this entry) as the disparity between levels of the presented stimulus that is detected on 50% of occasions by a particular observed response (Torgerson, 1958), rather than what is subjectively \"noticed\" or as a difference in magnitudes of consciously experienced 'sensations'. This 50%-discriminated disparity can be used as a universal unit of measurement of the psychological distance of the level of a feature in an object or situation and an internal standard of comparison in memory, such as the 'template' for a category or the 'norm' of recognition (Booth & Freeman, 1993). The JND-scaled distances from norm can be combined among observed and inferred psychophysical functions to generate diagnostics among hypothesised information-transforming (mental) processes mediating observed quantitative judgments (Richardson & Booth, 1993).\nSection::::Music production applications.\nIn music production, a single change in a property of sound which is below the JND does not affect perception of the sound. For amplitude, the JND for humans is around 1 dB (Middlebrooks & Green, 1991; Mills, 1960).\nThe \"just-noticeable difference (JND)\" (the threshold at which a change is perceived) depends on the tone's frequency content. Below 500 Hz, the JND is about 3 Hz for sine waves, and 1 Hz for complex tones; above 1000 Hz, the JND for sine waves is about 0.6% (about 10 cents).\nThe JND is typically tested by playing two tones in quick succession with the listener asked if there was a difference in their pitches. The JND becomes smaller if the two tones are played simultaneously as the listener is then able to discern beat frequencies. The total number of perceptible pitch steps in the range of human hearing is about 1,400; the total number of notes in the equal-tempered scale, from 16 to 16,000 Hz, is 120."], "wikipedia-1384005": ["Section::::Quantifying absorption.\nMany approaches can potentially quantify radiation absorption, with key examples following.\nBULLET::::- The absorption coefficient along with some closely related derived quantities\nBULLET::::- The attenuation coefficient (NB used infrequently with meaning synonymous with \"absorption coefficient\")\nBULLET::::- The molar attenuation coefficient (also called \"molar absorptivity\"), which is the absorption coefficient divided by molarity (see also Beer\u2013Lambert law)\nBULLET::::- The mass attenuation coefficient (also called \"mass extinction coefficient\"), which is the absorption coefficient divided by density\nBULLET::::- The absorption cross section and scattering cross-section, related closely to the absorption and attenuation coefficients, respectively\nBULLET::::- \"Extinction\" in astronomy, which is equivalent to the attenuation coefficient\nBULLET::::- Other measures of radiation absorption, including penetration depth and skin effect, propagation constant, attenuation constant, phase constant, and complex wavenumber, complex refractive index and extinction coefficient, complex dielectric constant, electrical resistivity and conductivity.\nBULLET::::- Related measures, including absorbance (also called \"optical density\") and optical depth (also called \"optical thickness\")\nAll these quantities measure, at least to some extent, how well a medium absorbs radiation.

We can achieve this linearization via a simple row-major data layout.

The model additionally considered root water uptake as well as a range of pertinent boundary conditions required to ensure wide applicability of the model.\n\nSWMII significantly extended the capabilities and ease of use of UNSAT. The code simulated variably-saturated water flow in two-dimensional transport domains, implemented the van Genuchten soil hydraulic functions (van Genuchten, 1980) and modifications thereof, considered root water uptake by taking advantage of some of the features of the SWATRE model (Feddes et al., 1978), and included scaling factors to enable simulations of flow in heterogeneous soils. The code also allowed the flow region to be composed of nonuniform soils having an arbitrary degree of local anisotropy.\n\nThe SWMS_2D model (\u0160im\u016fnek et al., 1992) considerably extended the capabilities of SWMII by including provisions for solute transport. Solute transport was described using the standard advection-dispersion equation that included linear sorption, first-order degradation in both the liquid and solid phases, and zero-order production in both phases. Several other numerical improvements were at the time also implemented in SWMS_2D. These included solution of the mixed form of the Richards equation as suggested by Celia et al. (1990), thus providing excellent mass balances in the water flow calculations. While SWMII could simulate water flow in either two-dimensional vertical or horizontal planes, SWMS_2D extended the range of applications also to three-dimensional axisymetrical flow domains around a vertical axis of symmetry.

It could handle flow regions delineated by irregular boundaries, as well as three-dimensional regions exhibiting radial symmetry about the vertical axis.

If the walls are connected, then they may be deformed into a loop or circle. Then wall following reduces to walking around a circle from start to finish. To further this idea, notice that by grouping together connected components of the maze walls, the boundaries between these are precisely the solutions, even if there is more than one solution (see figures on the right).\n\nIf the maze is not simply-connected (i.e. if the start or endpoints are in the center of the structure surrounded by passage loops, or the pathways cross over and under each other and such parts of the solution path are surrounded by passage loops), this method will not reach the goal.\n\nAnother concern is that care should be taken to begin wall-following at the entrance to the maze. If the maze is not simply-connected and one begins wall-following at an arbitrary point inside the maze, one could find themselves trapped along a separate wall that loops around on itself and containing no entrances or exits. Should it be the case that wall-following begins late, attempt to mark the position in which wall-following began.

It suggests that decisions are chosen based on the retrieval of relevant knowledge from memory. This knowledge includes information from previous identical and similar situations. The model assumes that, because the memory system is so complex, there never is one precise optimal choice.\n\nMemory integration dictates one's preferences for a given alternative. The PAM model suggests that preferences are formed when individuals retrieve from memory a set of queries regarding the attributes of the alternative choices. These queries are believed to be an automatic, unconscious process. Many individuals think largely in terms of emotions when asked to make a decision, and so the way in which a question is posed as well as the manner in which it is asked impacts the decision-making process. If asked to choose where to go for dinner, one will select a series of possible restaurants, consider each option, and determine the positive attributes of each. The restaurant chosen will be the one with the greatest number of positive attributes.\n\nThis choice depends on the order in which one evaluates the benefits of each option and whether one considers the negative rather than the positive possibilities. The phrasing of a question also affects this query process. For example, \"the car tapped the pole\" versus \"the car crashed into the pole.\" The framing of a question primes different components of the memory system and has the ability to reconstruct our memories. Memory is not an event that occurs in isolation, but is integrated and thus influenced by the goals of the decision-maker, the questions posed, and an infinite amount of internal and external factors."], "wikipedia-265752": ["Decision-making (also spelled decision making and decisionmaking) is regarded as the cognitive process resulting in the selection of a belief or a course of action among several alternative possibilities.

It is therefore a process which can be more or less rational or irrational and can be based on explicit or tacit knowledge and beliefs. Tacit knowledge is often used to fill the gaps in complex decision making processes. Usually both of these types of knowledge, tacit and explicit, are used together in the decision-making process.\nA major part of decision-making involves the analysis of a finite set of alternatives described in terms of evaluative criteria. Then the task might be to rank these alternatives in terms of how attractive they are to the decision-maker(s) when all the criteria are considered simultaneously. Another task might be to find the best alternative or to determine the relative total priority of each alternative (for instance, if alternatives represent projects competing for funds) when all the criteria are considered simultaneously.

The algorithm then backtracks along previously visited vertices, until it finds a vertex connected to yet more uncharted territory. It will then proceed down the new path as it had before, backtracking as it encounters dead-ends, and ending only when the algorithm has backtracked past the original \"root\" vertex from the very first step.\n\nSection::::Graph traversal algorithms.:Breadth-first search.\nA breadth-first search (BFS) is another technique for traversing a finite graph.

By contrast, total-order planning maintains a total ordering between all actions at every stage of planning. Given a problem in which some sequence of actions is required in order to achieve a goal, a partial-order plan specifies all actions that need to be taken, but specifies an ordering between actions only where necessary.\nConsider the following situation: a person must travel from the start to the end of an obstacle course. This obstacle course is composed of a bridge, a see-saw and a swing-set. The bridge must be traversed before the see-saw and swing-set are reachable. Once reachable, the see-saw and swing-set can be traversed in any order, after which the end is reachable. In a partial-order plan, ordering between these obstacles is specified only when necessary. The bridge must be traversed first. Second, either the see-saw or swing-set can be traversed. Third, the remaining obstacle can be traversed. Then the end can be traversed. Partial-order planning relies upon the Principle of Least Commitment for its efficiency. \nSection::::Partial-order plan.\nA partial-order plan or partial plan is a plan which specifies all actions that need to be taken, but only specifies the order between actions when necessary.

In the worst-case scenario, Quicksort makes O(\"n\") comparisons; however, such an occurrence is rare. Quicksort almost invariably makes O(\"n\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"n\") comparisons instead, and even outperforms other algorithms which can guarantee O(\"n\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"n\") behavior.

Similarly, it is unreasonable to assume an adversary for an encoding and decoding system would be able to test every single error pattern in order to find the most effective one.\nTherefore, a computationally bounded adversarial model has been proposed as a compromise between the two.

This method contains code for the parts of the overall algorithm that are invariant. The template ensures that the overarching algorithm is always followed. In the template method, portions of the algorithm that may \"vary\" are implemented by sending self messages that request the execution of additional \"helper\" methods. In the base class, these helper methods are given a default implementation, or none at all (that is, thay may be abstract methods).\n\nSubclasses of the base class \"fill in\" the empty or \"variant\" parts of the \"template\" with specific algorithms that vary from one subclass to another. It is important that subclasses do \"not\" override the template method itself.\n\nAt run-time, the algorithm represented by the template method is executed by sending the template message to an instance of one of the concrete subclasses. Through inheritance, the template method in the base class starts to execute. When the template method sends a message to self requesting one of the helper methods, the message will be received by the concrete sub-instance. If the helper method has been overridden, the overriding implementation in the sub-instance will execute; if it has not been overridden, the inherited implementation in the base class will execute. This mechanism ensures that the overall algorithm follows the same steps every time, while allowing the details of some steps to depend on which instance received the original request to execute the algorithm.\n\nSome of the self messages sent by the template method may be to \"hook methods.\" These methods are implemented in the same base class as the template method, but with empty bodies (i.e., they do nothing).

It will paint over the parts that are normally not visible \u2014 thus solving the visibility problem \u2014 at the cost of having painted invisible areas of distant objects. The ordering used by the algorithm is called a \"'depth order'\", and does not have to respect the numerical distances to the parts of the scene: the essential property of this ordering is, rather, that if one object obscures part of another then the first object is painted after the object that it obscures. Thus, a valid ordering can be described as a topological ordering of a directed acyclic graph representing occlusions between objects.\n\nThe algorithm can fail in some cases, including cyclic overlap or piercing polygons. In the case of cyclic overlap, as shown in the figure to the right, Polygons A, B, and C overlap each other in such a way that it is impossible to determine which polygon is above the others. In this case, the offending polygons must be cut to allow sorting. Newell's algorithm, proposed in 1972, provides a method for cutting such polygons. Numerous methods have also been proposed in the field of computational geometry.\n\nThe case of piercing polygons arises when one polygon intersects another. As with cyclic overlap, this problem may be resolved by cutting the offending polygons.\n\nIn basic implementations, the painter's algorithm can be inefficient. It forces the system to render each point on every polygon in the visible set, even if that polygon is occluded in the finished scene. This means that, for detailed scenes, the painter's algorithm can overly tax the computer hardware.\n\nA reverse painter's algorithm is sometimes used, in which objects nearest to the viewer are painted first \u2014 with the rule that paint must never be applied to parts of the image that are already painted (unless they are partially transparent). In a computer graphic system, this can be very efficient, since it is not necessary to calculate the colors (using lighting, texturing and such) for parts of much distant scene that are hidden by nearby objects. However, the reverse algorithm suffers from many of the same problems as the standard version.\n\nThese and other flaws with the algorithm led to the development of Z-buffer techniques, which can be viewed as a development of the painter's algorithm, by resolving depth conflicts on a pixel-by-pixel basis, reducing the need for a depth-based rendering order. Even in such systems, a variant of the painter's algorithm is sometimes employed. As Z-buffer implementations generally rely on fixed-precision depth-buffer registers implemented in hardware, there is scope for visibility problems due to rounding error. These are overlaps or gaps at joints between polygons. To avoid this, some graphics engine implementations \"overrender\", drawing the affected edges of both polygons in the order given by painter's algorithm. This means that some pixels are actually drawn twice (as in the full painter's algorithm) but this happens on only small parts of the image and has a negligible performance effect."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-26938706": 1, "wikipedia-32537366": 1, "wikipedia-3114382": 1, "wikipedia-7711975": 1, "wikipedia-1631564": 1, "wikipedia-11720031": 1, "wikipedia-31074815": 1, "wikipedia-2368154": 1, "wikipedia-164866": 1, "wikipedia-47028": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-26938706": 2, "wikipedia-32537366": 1, "wikipedia-3114382": 2, "wikipedia-7711975": 1, "wikipedia-1631564": 1, "wikipedia-11720031": 1, "wikipedia-31074815": 1, "wikipedia-2368154": 1, "wikipedia-164866": 2, "wikipedia-47028": 2}}}

Solving this problem with a classical computer algorithm requires computing the permanent of the unitary transform matrix, which may be either impossible or take a prohibitively long time. In 2014, it was proposed that existing technology and standard probabilistic methods of generating single photon states could be used as input into a suitable quantum computable linear optical network and that sampling of the output probability distribution would be demonstrably superior using quantum algorithms. In 2015, investigation predicted the sampling problem had similar complexity for inputs other than Fock state photons and identified a transition in computational complexity from classically simulatable to just as hard as the Boson Sampling Problem, dependent on the size of coherent amplitude inputs.\n\nSection::::Algorithms based on the quantum Fourier transform.:Estimating Gauss sums.\nA Gauss sum is a type of exponential sum.

Classically, formula_4 queries are required, even if we allow bounded-error probabilistic algorithms.\nBohmian Mechanics is a non-local hidden variable interpretation of quantum mechanics. It has been shown that a non-local hidden variable quantum computer could implement a search of an N-item database at most in formula_6 steps. This is slightly faster than the formula_3 steps taken by Grover's algorithm. Neither search method will allow quantum computers to solve NP-Complete problems in polynomial time.\n\nSection::::Algorithms based on amplitude amplification.:Quantum counting.\nQuantum counting solves a generalization of the search problem. It solves the problem of counting the number of marked entries in an unordered list, instead of just detecting if one exists. Specifically, it counts the number of marked entries in an formula_8-element list, with error formula_9 making only formula_10 queries, where formula_11 is the number of marked elements in the list.

We use the arguments (or suffixes) m and n to represent the component number of row decomposition and column decomposition, respectively rather than the subscripts indicating the row and the column of a matrix. Notice that the m and n indicate the number of components resulting from row(horizontal) decomposition and then column (vertical) decomposition, respectively.\nBy combining the components of the same scale or the comparable scales with minimal difference will yield a 2D feature with best physical significance. The components of the first row and the first column are approximately the same or comparable scale although their scales are increasing gradually along the row or column. Therefore, combining the components of the first row and the first column will obtain the first complete 2D component (C2D1). The subsequent process is to perform the same combination technique to the rest of the components, the contribution of the noises are distributed to the separate component according to their scales. As a result, the coherent structures of the components emerge, In this way, the pseudo-BEMD method can be applied to reveal the evolution of spatial structures of data.\nFollowing the convention of 1D EMD, the last component of the complete 2D components is called residue.\nThe decomposition scheme proposed here could be extended to data of any dimensions such as data of a solid with different density or other measurable properties\ngiven as formula_13\nIn which the subscription, n, indicated the number of dimensions. The procedure is identical as stated above: the decomposition starts with the first dimension,and proceeds to the second and third till all the dimensions are exhausted"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-44358953": 3, "wikipedia-32575067": 1, "wikipedia-41074252": 2, "wikipedia-2218035": 1, "wikipedia-52728349": 1, "wikipedia-4196522": 1, "wikipedia-14292311": 1, "wikipedia-29163906": 1, "wikipedia-52541030": 1, "wikipedia-52211120": 2}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-44358953": 3, "wikipedia-32575067": 1, "wikipedia-41074252": 3, "wikipedia-2218035": 1, "wikipedia-52728349": 1, "wikipedia-4196522": 1, "wikipedia-14292311": 1, "wikipedia-29163906": 1, "wikipedia-52541030": 2, "wikipedia-52211120": 3}}}

The whole process can take up to several years. Virtually every person in the organization is involved, whether they are part of the SAP technical support organization (TSO) or the actual end-users of the SAP software.\n\nDesign and initially staff the SAP TSO\nThe first major step of the project preparation phase is to design and initially staff an SAP technical support organization (TSO), which is the organization that is charged with addressing and designing a\n\nCraft solution vision.\nThe second project preparation job is to define a so-called solution vision, i.e. a vision of the future-state of the SAP solution, where it is important to address both business and financial requirements (budgets). The main focus within the vision should be on the company\u2019s core business and how the SAP solution will better enable that core business to be successful. Next to that, the shortcomings of the current systems should be described and short but clear requirements should be provided regarding availability (uptime), security, manageability and scalability of the SAP system.\n\nIdentify high availability and disaster recovery requirements\nThe next step is identifying the high availability requirements and the more serious disaster recovery requirements. This is to plan what to do with later downtime of the SAP system, caused by e.g. hardware failures, application failures or power outages. It should be noted that it is very important to calculate the cost of downtime, so that an organization has a good idea of its actual availability requirements.\n\nStaff TSO\nThe TSO (Technical Support Organisation) is the most important resource for an organization that is implementing SAP, so staffing the TSO is a vital job which can consume a lot of time. In a previous phase, the organization should already have staffed the most vital positions. At this point the organization should staff the bulk of the TSO, i.e. fill the positions that directly support the near-term objectives of the implementation, which are to develop and begin the installation/implementation of the SAP data center. Examples are: data center experts, network infrastructure experts, security specialists and database administration experts.\n\nTraining\nOne of the most vital stages of the implementation process is training. Few people within an organization are SAP experts or even have worked with SAP software. It is therefore important to train the end users but especially the SAP TSO: the people who design and implement the solution. The usual activity is to train a group of key users who in turn train the staff (source: practicalsap.com). The organisation's key users must be involved in the implementation project and testing of the system. Many people within the TSO need all kinds of training.\n\nSetup SAP data center\nThe next step is to set up the SAP data center. This means either building a new data center facility or transforming the current data center into a foundation capable of supporting the SAP solution stack, i.e. all of the technology layers and components (SAP software products) in a productive SAP installation.\n\nPerform installations\nThe following step is to install the required SAP software parts which are called components and technological foundations like a web application server or enterprise portals, to a state ready for business process configuration. The most vital sub steps are to prepare your OS, prepare the database server and then start installing SAP software.\n\nRound out support for SAP\nBefore moving into the functional development phase, the organization should identify and staff the remaining TSO roles, e.g. roles that relate to helpdesk work and other such support providing work.\n\nAddress change management\nThe next challenge for an organization is all about change management / change control, which means to develop a planned approach to the changes the organization faces. The objective here is to maximize the collective efforts of all people involved in the change and to minimize the risk of failure of implementing the changes related to the SAP implementation."], "wikipedia-45316265": ["Instructional rounds include several steps: formation of a network that ideally includes representative members from all those who impact student learning; choosing a problem to be addressed; classroom observation; observation debrief ; detection of the next steps, and regular repetition of this process.\n\nSection::::Description of common practice.:Detection of the next steps.\nThere are different ways of detecting next steps of work.

Before going live with a SAP system, it is vital to do many different kinds of testing, since there is often a large, complex infrastructure of hardware and software involved. Both requirements as well as quality parameters are to be tested. Important types of testing are:\nBULLET::::- Functional testing: to test using functional use cases, i.e. a set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine if a certain business process works\nBULLET::::- Integration testing\nBULLET::::- Regression testing\nAll tests should be preceded by creating solid test plans.\nAgreements will be met. This can be done with SAP's standard application benchmarks, to benchmark the organization's configurations against configurations that have been tested by SAP's hardware technology partners. Again, a test plan should be created at first.\nSection::::Implementation processes.:Final preparation.\nPrepare for cutover\nThe final phase before going live with SAP is often referred to as the cutover phase, which is the process of transitioning from one system to a new one. The organization needs to plan, prepare and execute the cutover, by creating a cutover plan that describes all cutover tasks that have to be performed before the actual go-live. Examples of cutover tasks are:\nBULLET::::- Review and update all systems-related operations procedures like backup policies and system monitoring\nBULLET::::- Assign ownership of SAP's functional processes to individuals\nBULLET::::- Let SAP SE do a GoingLive check, to get their blessing to go live with the system\nBULLET::::- Lock down the system, i.e. do not make any more changes to the SAP system\nSection::::Implementation processes.:Go live & Support.\nAll of the previously described phases all lead towards this final moment: the go-live.

The primary aim is to identify the most effective and efficient solution in technical and economic terms (e.g. the most efficient allocation of resources).\nSection::::Approaches.:Policy process.\nThe policy process approach puts its focal point onto political processes and involved stakeholders; its scope is the broader meso-scale and it interprets problems using a political lens (i.e., the interests and goals of elected officials).

One way of doing this follows a heuristic model called the \"policy cycle\". In its simplest form, the policy cycle, which is often depicted visually as a loop or circle, starts with the identification of the problem, proceeds to an examination of the different policy tools that could be used to respond to that problem, then goes on to the implementation stage, in which one or more policies are put into practice (e.g., a new regulation or subsidy is set in place), and then finally, once the policy has been implemented and run for a certain period, the policy is evaluated.

Repeat this procedure for slot t+1.\nNote that the random event and queue backlogs observed on slot \"t\" act as given constants when selecting the control action for the slot t minimization. Thus, each slot involves a deterministic search for the minimizing control action over the set \"A\". A key feature of this algorithm is that it does not require knowledge of the probability distribution of the random event process.\nSection::::How it works.:Approximate scheduling.\nThe above algorithm involves finding a minimum of a function over an abstract set \"A\". In general cases, the minimum might not exist, or might be difficult to find. Thus, it is useful to assume the algorithm is implemented in an approximate manner as follows: Define \"C\" as a non-negative constant, and assume that for all slots \"t\", the control action formula_16 is chosen in the set \"A\" to satisfy:\nSuch a control action is called a \"C-additive approximation\". The case \"C\" = 0 corresponds to exact minimization of the desired expression on every slot\u00a0\"t\".\nSection::::Performance analysis.\nThis section shows the algorithm results in a time average penalty that is within O(1/V) of optimality, with a corresponding O(V) tradeoff in average queue size.\nSection::::Performance analysis.:Average penalty analysis.\nDefine an \"formula_44-only policy\" to be a stationary and randomized policy for choosing the control action formula_16 based on the observed formula_14 only. That is, an formula_44-only policy specifies, for each possible random event formula_48, a conditional probability distribution for selecting a control action formula_40 given that formula_50. Such a policy makes decisions independent of current queue backlog. Assume there exists an formula_44-only policy formula_52 that satisfies the following:\nThe expectations above are with respect to the random variable formula_14 for slot formula_56 and the random control action formula_16 chosen on slot formula_58 after observing formula_14. Such a policy formula_52 can be shown to exist whenever the desired control problem is feasible and the event space for formula_14 and action space for formula_16 are finite, or when mild closure properties are satisfied.\nLet formula_16 represent the action taken by a C-additive approximation of the drift-plus-penalty algorithm of the previous section, for some non-negative constant C. To simplify terminology, we call this action the \"drift-plus-penalty action\", rather than the \"C-additive approximate drift-plus-penalty action\". Let formula_52 represent the formula_44-only decision:\nAssume the drift-plus-penalty action formula_16 is used on each and every slot. By (Eq. 2), the drift-plus-penalty expression under this formula_16 action satisfies the following for each slot formula_70\nwhere the last inequality follows because action formula_16 comes within an additive constant formula_73 of minimizing the preceding expression over all other actions in the set formula_74 including formula_75 Taking expectations of the above inequality gives:\nNotice that the formula_52 action was never actually implemented. Its existence was used only for comparison purposes to reach the final inequality. Summing the above inequality over the first formula_78 slots gives:\nDividing the above by formula_80 yields the following result, which holds for all slots formula_81\nThus, the time average expected penalty can be made arbitrarily close to the optimal value formula_83 by choosing formula_84 suitably large. It can be shown that all virtual queues are mean rate stable, and so all desired constraints are satisfied.

In order to show that it is enough to show that all of the verification rules work perfectly and without false verification.\n\nSection::::Proof of Correctness.:Correctness of ZCN.\nThe algebraic point of view of ZCN rule is that if in a system of linear equations the right hand side of the equation is zero then almost surely all of the unknowns in that equations are zero. This is due to the fact that the original signal is assumed to be sparse, besides, we also should have the assumption that the non-zero elements of the signals are chosen form a continuous distribution.

If an injective function \"h : OPT(I) \u2192 A(I)\" exists, it follows that |\"OPT(I)\"| \"\u2264\" |\"A(I)\"|.

The first focuses on improving the program\u2019s performance while reducing the resource usage while the latter focuses on ensuring that the program does what it is supposed to do.\n\nIn the context of program correctness, static analysis can discover vulnerabilities during the development phase of the program. These vulnerabilities are easier to correct than the ones found during the testing phase since static analysis leads to the root of the vulnerability.\n\nDue to many forms of static analysis being computationally undecidable, the mechanisms for doing it will not always terminate with the right answer either because they sometimes return a false negative (\"no problems found\" when the code does in fact have problems) or a false positive, or because they never return the wrong answer but sometimes never terminate. Despite their limitations, the first type of mechanism might reduce the number of vulnerabilities, while the second can sometimes give strong assurance of the lack of a certain class of vulnerabilities.\n\nModel checking refers to strict, formal, and automated ways to check if a \"model\" (which in this context means a formal model of a piece of code, though in other contexts it can be a model of a piece of hardware) complies with a given specification. Due to the inherent finite state nature of code, and both the specification and the code being convertible into logical formulae, it is possible to check if the system violates the specification using efficient algorithmic methods."], "wikipedia-393736": ["An argument is deductive when the conclusion is necessary given the premises. That is, the conclusion cannot be false if the premises are true.\nIf a deductive conclusion follows duly from its premises, then it is valid; otherwise, it is invalid (that an argument is invalid is not to say it is false. It may have a true conclusion, just not on account of the premises). An examination of the following examples will show that the relationship between premises and conclusion is such that the truth of the conclusion is already implicit in the premises. Bachelors are unmarried because we \"say\" they are; we have defined them so. Socrates is mortal because we have included him in a set of beings that are mortal. The conclusion for a valid deductive argument is already contained in the premises since its truth is strictly a matter of logical relations. It cannot say more than its premises. Inductive premises, on the other hand, draw their substance from fact and evidence, and the conclusion accordingly makes a factual claim or prediction. Its reliability varies proportionally with the evidence. Induction wants to reveal something \"new\" about the world. One could say that induction wants to say \"more\" than is contained in the premises.\nTo better see the difference between inductive and deductive arguments, consider that it would not make sense to say: \"all rectangles so far examined have four right angles, so the next one I see will have four right angles.\" This would treat logical relations as something factual and discoverable, and thus variable and uncertain. Likewise, speaking deductively we may permissibly say. \"All unicorns can fly; I have a unicorn named Charlie; Charlie can fly.\" This deductive argument is valid because the logical relations hold; we are not interested in their factual soundness.\nInductive reasoning is inherently uncertain. It only deals in the extent to which, given the premises, the conclusion is \"credible\" according to some theory of evidence. Examples include a many-valued logic, Dempster\u2013Shafer theory, or probability theory with rules for inference such as Bayes' rule. Unlike deductive reasoning, it does not rely on universals holding over a closed domain of discourse to draw conclusions, so it can be applicable even in cases of epistemic uncertainty (technical issues with this may arise however; for example, the second axiom of probability is a closed-world assumption).\nAnother crucial difference between these two types of argument is that deductive certainty is impossible in non-axiomatic systems such as reality, leaving inductive reasoning as the primary route to (probabilistic) knowledge of such systems.\nGiven that \"if \"A\" is true then that would cause \"B\", \"C\", and \"D\" to be true\", an example of deduction would be \"\"A\" is true therefore we can deduce that \"B\", \"C\", and \"D\" are true\". An example of induction would be \"\"B\", \"C\", and \"D\" are observed to be true therefore \"A\" might be true\". \"A\" is a reasonable explanation for \"B\", \"C\", and \"D\" being true."], "wikipedia-8198743": ["Competitive analysis is a method invented for analyzing online algorithms, in which the performance of an online algorithm (which must satisfy an unpredictable sequence of requests, completing each request without being able to see the future) is compared to the performance of an optimal \"offline algorithm\" that can view the sequence of requests in advance. An algorithm is \"competitive\" if its \"competitive ratio\"\u2014the ratio between its performance and the offline algorithm's performance\u2014is bounded. Unlike traditional worst-case analysis, where the performance of an algorithm is measured only for \"hard\" inputs, competitive analysis requires that an algorithm perform well both on hard and easy inputs, where \"hard\" and \"easy\" are defined by the performance of the optimal offline algorithm.\n\nIn competitive analysis, one imagines an \"adversary\" that deliberately chooses difficult data, to maximize the ratio of the cost of the algorithm being studied and some optimal algorithm. Adversaries range in power from the \"oblivious adversary\", which has no knowledge of the random choices made by the algorithm pitted against it, to the \"adaptive adversary\" that has full knowledge of how an algorithm works and its internal state at any point during its execution.

He calls this principle \"order-from-disorder.\" As an example he mentions diffusion, which can be modeled as a highly ordered process, but which is caused by random movement of atoms or molecules. If the number of atoms is reduced, the behaviour of a system becomes more and more random. He states that life greatly depends on order and that a na\u00efve physicist may assume that the master code of a living organism has to consist of a large number of atoms.\n\nIn chapter II and III, he summarizes what was known at this time about the hereditary mechanism. Most importantly, he elaborates the important role mutations play in evolution. He concludes that the carrier of hereditary information has to be both small in size and permanent in time, contradicting the na\u00efve physicist's expectation. This contradiction cannot be resolved by classical physics.\n\nIn chapter VI Schr\u00f6dinger states:\nHe knows that this statement is open to misconception and tries to clarify it. The main principle involved with \"order-from-disorder\" is the second law of thermodynamics, according to which entropy only increases in a closed system (such as the universe).

The last three lines on the blackboard are estimates of the density of matter in the universe \"\u03c1\", the radius of the universe \"P\" and the timespan \"t\" of the expansion of the universe respectively (\"L.J.\" on the blackboard indicates \"light years\" in German). It has recently been shown that these estimates contain a systematic numerical error.\n\nThe paper, known as The Friedmann-Einstein universe, is of historic significance because it constituted the first scientific publication in which Einstein embraced the possibility of a cosmos of time-varying radius. In the paper, Einstein adopts Alexander Friedman's 1922 analysis of relativistic models of a universe of time-varying radius and positive curvature, but sets the cosmological constant to zero, declaring it redundant, predicting a universe that expands and contracts over time. (The work is sometimes known as the Friedman-Einstein model of the universe). With the use of Edwin Hubble's observations of a linear redshift/distance relation for the spiral nebulae, Einstein extracts from his model estimates of \"\u03c1\" ~ 10 g/cm, \"P\" ~ 10 light-years and \"t\" ~ 10 years for the density of matter, the radius of the cosmos and the timespan of the cosmic expansion respectively. These values are displayed in the last three lines on the Oxford blackboard (although the units of measurement are not specifically stated for the density estimate, cgs units are implied by the other calculations).\n\nIt has also been noted that the numerical estimates of cosmic parameters in Einstein's 1931 paper \u2013 and on the blackboard \u2013 contain a systematic error. Analysis of the 1931 paper shows that, given the contemporaneous Hubble constant of 500 km sMpc, Einstein's estimates of cosmic density, radius and timespan should have been \"\u03c1\" ~ 10 g/cm, \"P\" ~ 10 light-years and \"t\" ~ 10 years respectively. One line on the blackboard, not included in the published paper, makes the nature of Einstein's error clear. In the fourth line on the blackboard, Einstein obtains a value of 10 cm for the quantity \"D\", defined in the top line of the blackboard as \"D\" = (1/c). (1/P).(dP/dt), i.e., the Hubble constant divided by the speed of light. Simple calculation shows that the contemporaneous value of the Hubble constant in fact implied a value of \"D\" ~ 10 cm (or 10 m) for this quantity. It appears that Einstein stumbled in converting megaparsecs to cm, giving a density of matter that was too high by a factor of a hundred, a cosmic radius that was too low by a factor of ten, and a timespan for the expansion that was too high by a factor of ten. These errors were corrected in a later review of relativistic cosmology written by Einstein in 1945."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-1355398": 1, "wikipedia-42492459": 1, "wikipedia-25103139": 1, "wikipedia-49329005": 1, "wikipedia-12765882": 1, "wikipedia-57533237": 1, "wikipedia-40276": 1, "wikipedia-44759993": 1, "wikipedia-2172352": 1, "wikipedia-23560029": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-1355398": 1, "wikipedia-42492459": 2, "wikipedia-25103139": 1, "wikipedia-49329005": 1, "wikipedia-12765882": 1, "wikipedia-57533237": 1, "wikipedia-40276": 1, "wikipedia-44759993": 1, "wikipedia-2172352": 1, "wikipedia-23560029": 1}}}

This insight is reflected in discussions of the scalability problem in robotics. The internal processing needed for some bad architectures can grow out of proportion to new tasks needed of an agent. One of the primary reasons for scalability problems is that the amount of programming and knowledge engineering that the robot designers have to perform grows very rapidly with the complexity of the robot's tasks. There is mounting evidence that pre-programming cannot be the solution to the scalability problem ... The problem is that programmers introduce too many hidden assumptions in the robot's code.\n\nThe proposed solutions are to have the agent exploit the inherent physics of its environment, to exploit the constraints of its niche, and to have agent morphology based on parsimony and the principle of Redundancy. Redundancy reflects the desire for the error-correction of signals afforded by duplicating like channels. Additionally, it reflects the desire to exploit the associations between sensory modalities.\n\n(See redundant modalities). In terms of design, this implies that redundancy should be introduced with respect not only to one sensory modality but to several.

It can be an offline, finite training dataset (characteristic of a data mining, classification, or regression problem), or an online sequential stream of live training instances. Each training instance is assumed to include some number of \"features\" (also referred to as \"attributes\", or \"independent variables\"), and a single \"endpoint\" of interest (also referred to as the class, \"action\", \"phenotype\", \"prediction\", or \"dependent variable\"). Part of LCS learning can involve feature selection, therefore not all of the features in the training data need be informative. The set of feature values of an instance is commonly referred to as the \"state\". For simplicity let's assume an example problem domain with Boolean/binary features and a Boolean/binary class. For Michigan-style systems, one instance from the environment is trained on each learning cycle (i.e. incremental learning). Pittsburgh-style systems perform batch learning, where rule-sets are evaluated each iteration over much or all of the training data.\nSection::::Methodology.:Elements of a generic LCS algorithm.:Rule/classifier/population.\nA rule is a context dependent relationship between state values and some prediction. Rules typically take the form of an {IF:THEN} expression, (e.g. {\"IF 'condition' THEN 'action'},\" or as a more specific example, \"{IF 'red' AND 'octagon' THEN 'stop-sign'}\"). A critical concept in LCS and rule-based machine learning alike, is that an individual rule is not in itself a model, since the rule is only applicable when its condition is satisfied. Think of a rule as a \"local-model\" of the solution space.\nRules can be represented in many different ways to handle different data types (e.g. binary, discrete-valued, ordinal, continuous-valued). Given binary data LCS traditionally applies a ternary rule representation (i.e. rules can include either a 0, 1, or '#' for each feature in the data). The 'don't care' symbol (i.e. '#') serves as a wild card within a rule's condition allowing rules, and the system as a whole to generalize relationships between features and the target endpoint to be predicted. Consider the following rule (#1###0 ~ 1) (i.e. condition ~ action). This rule can be interpreted as: IF the second feature = 1 AND the sixth feature = 0 THEN the class prediction = 1. We would say that the second and sixth features were specified in this rule, while the others were generalized. This rule, and the corresponding prediction are only applicable to an instance when the condition of the rule is satisfied by the instance. This is more commonly referred to as matching. In Michigan-style LCS, each rule has its own fitness, as well as a number of other rule-parameters associated with it that can describe the number of copies of that rule that exist (i.e. the \"numerosity\"), the age of the rule, its accuracy, or the accuracy of its reward predictions, and other descriptive or experiential statistics. A rule along with its parameters is often referred to as a \"classifier\". In Michigan-style systems, classifiers are contained within a \"population\" [P] that has a user defined maximum number of classifiers. Unlike most stochastic search algorithms (e.g. evolutionary algorithms), LCS populations start out empty (i.e. there is no need to randomly initialize a rule population). Classifiers will instead be initially introduced to the population with a covering mechanism.\nIn any LCS, the trained model is a set of rules/classifiers, rather than any single rule/classifier. In Michigan-style LCS, the entire trained (and optionally, compacted) classifier population forms the prediction model.\nSection::::Methodology.:Elements of a generic LCS algorithm.:Matching.\nOne of the most critical and often time consuming elements of an LCS is the matching process. The first step in an LCS learning cycle takes a single training instance from the environment and passes it to [P] where matching takes place. In step two, every rule in [P] is now compared to the training instance to see which rules match (i.e. are contextually relevant to the current instance). In step three, any matching rules are moved to a \"match set\" [M]. A rule matches a training instance if all feature values specified in the rule condition are equivalent to the corresponding feature value in the training instance. For example, assuming the training instance is (001001 ~ 0), these rules would match: (###0## ~ 0), (00###1 ~ 0), (#01001 ~ 1), but these rules would not (1##### ~ 0), (000##1 ~ 0), (#0#1#0 ~ 1). Notice that in matching, the endpoint/action specified by the rule is not taken into consideration. As a result, the match set may contain classifiers that propose conflicting actions. In the fourth step, since we are performing supervised learning, [M] is divided into a correct set [C] and an incorrect set [I]. A matching rule goes into the correct set if it proposes the correct action (based on the known action of the training instance), otherwise it goes into [I]. In reinforcement learning LCS, an action set [A] would be formed here instead, since the correct action is not known.\nSection::::Methodology.:Elements of a generic LCS algorithm.:Covering.\nAt this point in the learning cycle, if no classifiers made it into either [M] or [C] (as would be the case when the population starts off empty), the covering mechanism is applied (fifth step). Covering is a form of \"online smart population initialization\". Covering randomly generates a rule that matches the current training instance (and in the case of supervised learning, that rule is also generated with the correct action. Assuming the training instance is (001001 ~ 0), covering might generate any of the following rules: (#0#0## ~ 0), (001001 ~ 0), (#010## ~ 0). Covering not only ensures that each learning cycle there is at least one correct, matching rule in [C], but that any rule initialized into the population will match at least one training instance. This prevents LCS from exploring the search space of rules that do not match any training instances.\nSection::::Methodology.:Elements of a generic LCS algorithm.:Parameter updates/credit assignment/learning.\nIn the sixth step, the rule parameters of any rule in [M] are updated to reflect the new experience gained from the current training instance. Depending on the LCS algorithm, a number of updates can take place at this step. For supervised learning, we can simply update the accuracy/error of a rule. Rule accuracy/error is different than model accuracy/error, since it is not calculated over the entire training data, but only over all instances that it matched. Rule accuracy is calculated by dividing the number of times the rule was in a correct set [C] by the number of times it was in a match set [M]. Rule accuracy can be thought of as a 'local accuracy'. Rule fitness is also updated here, and is commonly calculated as a function of rule accuracy. The concept of fitness is taken"], "wikipedia-287911": ["Section::::Essentials.:Identifying a problem: contradictions.\nAltshuller has shown that at the heart of some inventive problems lie contradictions (one of the basic TRIZ concepts) between two or more elements, such as, \"If we want more acceleration, we need a larger engine; but that will increase the cost of the car,\" that is, more of something desirable also brings more of something less desirable, or less of something else also desirable.\nThese are called \"technical contradictions\" by Altshuller. He also defined so-called physical or inherent contradictions: More of one thing and less of the same thing may both be desired in the same system. For instance, a higher temperature may be needed to melt a compound more rapidly, but a lower temperature may be needed to achieve a homogeneous mixture.\nAn \"inventive situation\" which challenges us to be inventive, might involve several such contradictions. Conventional solutions typically \"trade\" one contradictory parameter for another; no special inventiveness is needed for that. Rather, the inventor would develop a creative approach for resolving the contradiction, such as inventing an engine that produces more acceleration without increasing the cost of the engine.\nSection::::Essentials.:Inventive principles and the matrix of contradictions.\nAltshuller screened patents in order to find out what kind of contradictions were resolved or dissolved by the invention and the way this had been achieved. From this he developed a set of 40 inventive principles and later a matrix of contradictions. Rows of the matrix indicate the 39 system features that one typically wants to improve, such as speed, weight, accuracy of measurement and so on. Columns refer to typical undesired results. Each matrix cell points to principles that have been most frequently used in patents in order to resolve the contradiction.\nFor instance, Dolgashev mentions the following contradiction: increasing accuracy of measurement of machined balls while avoiding the use of expensive microscopes and elaborate control equipment. The matrix cell in row \"accuracy of measurement\" and column \"complexity of control\" points to several principles, among them the Copying Principle, which states, \"Use a simple and inexpensive optical copy with a suitable scale instead of an object that is complex, expensive, fragile or inconvenient to operate.\" From this general invention principle, the following idea might solve the problem: Taking a high-resolution image of the machined ball. A screen with a grid might provide the required measurement. As mentioned above, Altshuller abandoned this method of defining and solving \"technical\" contradictions in the mid 1980s and instead used SuField modeling and the 76 inventive standards and a number of other tools included in the algorithm for solving inventive problems, ARIZ.\nSection::::Essentials.:Laws of technical system evolution.\nAltshuller also studied the way technical systems have been developed and improved over time. From this, he discovered several trends (so called Laws of Technical Systems Evolution) that help engineers predict the most likely improvements that can be made to a given product. The most important of these laws involves the ideality of a system.\nSection::::Essentials.:Substance-field analysis.\nOne more technique that is frequently used by inventors involves the analysis of substances, fields and other resources that are currently not being used and that can be found within the system or nearby. TRIZ uses non-standard definitions for substances and fields. Altshuller developed methods to analyze resources; several of his invention principles involve the use of different substances and fields that help resolve contradictions and increase ideality of a technical system. For instance, videotext systems used television signals to transfer data, by taking advantage of the small time segments between TV frames in the signals.\nSuField analysis produces a structural model of the initial technological system, exposes its characteristics, and with the help of special laws, transforms the model of the problem. Through this transformation the structure of the solution that eliminates the shortcomings of the initial problem is revealed. SuField analysis is a special language of formulas with which it is possible to easily describe any technological system in terms of a specific (structural) model. A model produced in this manner is transformed according to special laws and regularities, thereby revealing the structural solution of the problem.\nSection::::Essentials.:ARIZ - algorithm of inventive problems solving.\nARIZ (Russian acronym of \u0430\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043c \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447 - \u0410\u0420\u0418\u0417) (algorithm of inventive problems solving) is a list of about 85 step-by-step procedures to solve complicated invention problems, where other tools of TRIZ alone (Sufield analysis, 40 inventive principles, etc.) are not sufficient.\nVarious TRIZ software (see Invention Machine's Goldfire, ideation international, Guided Innovation Toolkit, TriSolver, Innovation Suite, TRIZ GB) are based on this algorithm.\nStarting with an updated matrix of contradictions, semantic analysis, subcategories of inventive principles and lists of scientific effects, some new interactive applications are other attempts to simplify the problem formulation phase and the transition from a generic problem to a whole set of specific solutions.

Wright begins by acknowledging that all men, from savage to statesmen, will practice and preach what they hold to be true without regard for their potential ignorance. In other words, men believe that what they think is true, is indeed true solely based on the fact that they are the ones believing it. Wright cites ignorance being the greatest contributor to this logical fallacy. From here, Wright explains her conception of knowledge by explaining, \u201c[knowledge is] what there is for us to know, the means we possess for acquiring such knowledge as is of possible attainment\u2026and to seek in our knowledge the test of our opinions\u201d.\nIn general, Wright posits that the knowledge we accumulate takes two distinct forms: knowledge that is taught and knowledge that is accumulated through experience. The knowledge that is taught to us is not necessarily known. To her, a more appropriate word for this type of information would be belief. This is in contrast to the form of knowledge that we know from our direct experience. Wright says that this kind of knowledge is more accurate because it comes from our own experience; therefore, it is more familiar to us. Wright summarizes by saying that, \u201cKnowledge signifies things known\u201d .\nBULLET::::- Religion\nBULLET::::- Morals\nIn the following two lectures, Wright examines her conception of knowledge in relation to religion and morality. As stated in Lectures I-III, Wright posits that knowledge implies that things are known; therefore, for any subject to have truth, it must be built on empirical foundations. Wright sees religion, as a subject, lacking on these factual foundations.\nTo provide clarity to her readers, Wright attempts to outline what she deems an appropriate subject, or science, containing truth. In the beginning, Wright acknowledges that there must be facts that are known through our experience and direct observation. With these empirical foundations, Wright explains that we have our premises from which we can build an appropriate science. Without these factual premises, the science would be built on false foundations. Wright compares this to building a castle in the air.\nReligion, to Wright, is a science built on false foundations. With much disagreement among people as to the appropriate practices of religion, the falsehood of religion should be evident. If religion were built on empirical foundations, Wright suggests the truth should be evident and there would be no disagreements therefore. Furthermore, Wright explains that the mere fact that the knowledge gained through religion is primarily belief, as opposed to experiential knowledge, exposes religion's falsehood.\nBULLET::::- Opinions\nBULLET::::- On existing evils and their remedy\nWright begins the last two lectures by critiquing the role that opinions have played in our history. She begins by suggesting that an appropriate and mature understanding of opinions could have prevented many of the problems that were being faced during her time. Again, Wright cites ignorance as the greatest contributor to error.\nAnger, Wright suggests, is an unwarranted, but often felt emotion in response to differing opinions. To solve this problem, Wright explains that an individual receiving the opinion must simply inquire as to what facts the opinion was derived.

It was the key, for example, to Karatsuba's fast multiplication method, the quicksort and mergesort algorithms, the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication, and fast Fourier transforms.\nIn all these examples, the D&C approach led to an improvement in the asymptotic cost of the solution.\nFor example, if (a) the base cases have constant-bounded size, the work of splitting the problem and combining the partial solutions is proportional to the problem's size \"n\", and (b) there is a bounded number \"p\" of subproblems of size ~ \"n\"/\"p\" at each stage, then the cost of the divide-and-conquer algorithm will be O(\"n\"\u202flog\"n\")."], "wikipedia-59104434": ["Allocating unused classrooms.\nIn California, the law says that public school classrooms should be shared fairly among all public school pupils, including those in charter schools.

A new algorithm allocates classrooms to schools using a non-trivial implementation of the \"randomized leximin mechanism.\" Unfortunately it was not deployed in practice, but it was tested using computer simulations based on real school data. While the problem is computationally-hard, simulations show that the implementation scales gracefully in terms of running time: even when there are 300 charter schools, it terminates in a few minutes on average. Moreover, while theoretically the algorithm guarantees only 1/4 of the maximum number of allocated classrooms, in the simulations it satisfies on average at least 98% of the maximum number of charter schools that can possibly be satisfied, and allocates on average at least 98% of the maximum number of classrooms that can possibly be allocated.\nResolving international conflicts.\nThe adjusted winner procedure is a protocol for simultaneously resolving several issues under conflict, such that the agreement is envy-free, equitable, and Pareto efficient. It has been commercialized through the FairOutcomes website. While there are no account of it actually being used to resolve disputes, there are several counterfactual studies checking what would have been the results of using this procedure to solve international disputes:\nBULLET::::- For the Camp David Accords, the authors construct approximate numeric valuation functions for Israel and Egypt, based on the relative importance of each issue for each country. They then run the AW protocol. The theoretical results are very similar to the actual agreement, which leads the authors to conclude that the agreement is as fair as it could be.\nBULLET::::- For the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the author constructs the valuation functions based on a survey of expert opinions, and describes the agreement that would result from running the AW protocol with these valuations.\nBULLET::::- For the Spratly Islands dispute, the authors construct a two-phase procedure for settling the dispute, and present its (hypothetic) outcome.\nFair Bargaining.\nFlood analyzed several cases of bargaining between a buyer and a seller on the price of purchasing a good (e.g. a car). He found that the \"split-the-difference\" principle was acceptable by both participants. The same cooperative principle was found in more abstract non-cooperative games. However, in some cases, bidders in an auction did not find a cooperative solution.\nFair Load-Shedding.\nOlabambo et al develop heuristic algorithms for fair allocation of electricity disconnections in developing countries. They test the fairness and welfare of their algorithms on electricity usage data from Texas, which they adapt to the situation in Nigeria.\nFair cake-cutting.\nWalsh developed several algorithms for online fair cake-cutting. He tested them using a computerized simulation: valuation functions for each agent were generated by dividing the cake into random segments, and assigning a random value to each segment, normalizing the total value of the cake.

He tested his mechanism using simulations. He generated piecewise-constant valuation functions, whose constants were selected at random from the uniform distribution. He also tried Gaussian distributions and got similar results.\nFair item assignment.\nDickerson et al use simulations to check under what conditions an envy-free assignment of discrete items is likely to exist. They generate instances by sampling the value of each item to each agent from two probability distributions: uniform and \"correlated\". In the correlated sampling, they first sample an intrinsic value for each good, and then assign a random value to each agent drawn from a truncated nonnegative normal distribution around that intrinsic value. Their simulations show that, when the number of goods is larger than the number of agents by a logarithmic factor, envy-free allocations exist with high probability.\nSegal-Halevi et al use simulations from similar distributions to show that, in many cases, there exist allocations that are \"necessarily fair\" based on a certain convexity assumption on the agents' preferences."], "wikipedia-4993539": ["SDPs are in fact a special case of cone programming and can be efficiently solved by interior point methods."], "wikipedia-42676762": ["Section::::Procedure.\nThe problem we are trying to solve is: given a formula_6 Hermitian matrix formula_7 and a unit vector formula_8, find the solution vector formula_9 satisfying formula_10.

Problems of sufficient simplicity are solved directly. \nFor example, to sort a given list of \"n\" natural numbers, split it into two lists of about \"n\"/2 numbers each, sort each of them in turn, and interleave both results appropriately to obtain the sorted version of the given list (see the picture). This approach is known as the merge sort algorithm.\nThe name \"divide and conquer\" is sometimes applied to algorithms that reduce each problem to only one sub-problem, such as the binary search algorithm for finding a record in a sorted list (or its analog in numerical computing, the bisection algorithm for root finding). These algorithms can be implemented more efficiently than general divide-and-conquer algorithms; in particular, if they use tail recursion, they can be converted into simple loops. Under this broad definition, however, every algorithm that uses recursion or loops could be regarded as a \"divide-and-conquer algorithm\". Therefore, some authors consider that the name \"divide and conquer\" should be used only when each problem may generate two or more subproblems. The name decrease and conquer has been proposed instead for the single-subproblem class.\nAn important application of divide and conquer is in optimization, where if the search space is reduced (\"pruned\") by a constant factor at each step, the overall algorithm has the same asymptotic complexity as the pruning step, with the constant depending on the pruning factor (by summing the geometric series); this is known as prune and search."], "wikipedia-21706433": ["In mathematical optimization, neighborhood search is a technique that tries to find good or near-optimal solutions to a combinatorial optimisation problem by repeatedly transforming a current solution into a different solution in the neighborhood of the current solution.

For a very large-scale neighborhood search, the neighborhood is large and possibly exponentially sized.\nThe resulting algorithms can outperform algorithms using small neighborhoods because the local improvements are larger. If neighborhood searched is limited to just one or a very small number of changes from the current solution, then it can be difficult to escape from local minima, even with additional meta-heuristic techniques such as Simulated Annealing or Tabu search.

Some database structures are specially constructed to make search algorithms faster or more efficient, such as a search tree, hash map, or a database index.\n\nSearch algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching. Linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion. Binary, or half interval searches, repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. Comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order. Digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures that use numerical keys. Finally, hashing directly maps keys to records based on a hash function. Searches outside a linear search require that the data be sorted in some way.\n\nAlgorithms for searching virtual spaces are used in the constraint satisfaction problem, where the goal is to find a set of value assignments to certain variables that will satisfy specific mathematical equations and inequations / equalities. They are also used when the goal is to find a variable assignment that will maximize or minimize a certain function of those variables. Algorithms for these problems include the basic brute-force search (also called \"na\u00efve\" or \"uninformed\" search), and a variety of heuristics that try to exploit partial knowledge about the structure of this space, such as linear relaxation, constraint generation, and constraint propagation.\n\nAn important subclass are the local search methods, that view the elements of the search space as the vertices of a graph, with edges defined by a set of heuristics applicable to the case; and scan the space by moving from item to item along the edges, for example according to the steepest descent or best-first criterion, or in a stochastic search. This category includes a great variety of general metaheuristic methods, such as simulated annealing, tabu search, A-teams, and genetic programming, that combine arbitrary heuristics in specific ways.\n\nThis class also includes various tree search algorithms, that view the elements as vertices of a tree, and traverse that tree in some special order. Examples of the latter include the exhaustive methods such as depth-first search and breadth-first search, as well as various heuristic-based search tree pruning methods such as backtracking and branch and bound.\n\nAnother important sub-class consists of algorithms for exploring the game tree of multiple-player games, such as chess or backgammon, whose nodes consist of all possible game situations that could result from the current situation. The goal in these problems is to find the move that provides the best chance of a win, taking into account all possible moves of the opponent(s). Similar problems occur when humans or machines have to make successive decisions whose outcomes are not entirely under one's control, such as in robot guidance or in marketing, financial, or military strategy planning. This kind of problem \u2014 combinatorial search \u2014 has been extensively studied in the context of artificial intelligence. Examples of algorithms for this class are the minimax algorithm, alpha\u2013beta pruning, * Informational search and the A* algorithm.\n\nAn important and extensively studied subclass are the graph algorithms, in particular graph traversal algorithms, for finding specific sub-structures in a given graph \u2014 such as subgraphs, paths, circuits, and so on. Examples include Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, the nearest neighbour algorithm, and Prim's algorithm.\n\nAnother important subclass of this category are the string searching algorithms, that search for patterns within strings. Two famous examples are the Boyer\u2013Moore and Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithms, and several algorithms based on the suffix tree data structure.\n\nIn 1953, American statistician Jack Kiefer devised Fibonacci search which can be used to find the maximum of a unimodal function and has many other applications in computer science.\n\nThere are also search methods designed for quantum computers, like Grover's algorithm, that are theoretically faster than linear or brute-force search even without the help of data structures or heuristics."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-14706356": 3, "wikipedia-82368": 1, "wikipedia-16918844": 1, "wikipedia-16918921": 1, "wikipedia-39323412": 1, "wikipedia-50828755": 1, "wikipedia-13958057": 1, "wikipedia-28249": 1, "wikipedia-42922637": 1, "wikipedia-507221": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-14706356": 3, "wikipedia-82368": 1, "wikipedia-16918844": 1, "wikipedia-16918921": 1, "wikipedia-39323412": 1, "wikipedia-50828755": 1, "wikipedia-13958057": 1, "wikipedia-28249": 2, "wikipedia-42922637": 1, "wikipedia-507221": 1}}}

All advantages and disadvantages to the status quo (resulting from inherency) and of the plan (resulting from solvency) are evaluated under significance. A common equivocation is to confuse \"significance\" with the word \"significantly\" that appears in many resolutions. Significance is derived from calculating between advantages and disadvantages, whereas significant policy changes are determined by how much the policy itself changed (rather than how good or bad the effects are).\nBULLET::::- Harms: Harms are a way of quantifying the problems or short-comings of the status quo. Since they prove the \"why not\" of continuing with the status quo, harms are closely related to, but not the same as, Significance.\nBULLET::::- Inherency: The actual situation and causes of the status quo.

In modern usage, most paradigms and regions do not consider topicality to be a \"stock issue\" \"per se\"; instead, it being a procedural one brought up by the negative.\nBULLET::::- Solvency: The mechanics of the plan itself are defined in solvency. What does it cause and why? Here the harms are often demonstrated to be solved by the plan, or the link to new advantages are shown. Without solvency, a plan is useless. Thus, the affirmative loses a debate without solvency, no matter how well it described problems of the status quo.\nBULLET::::- Justification: Do the case and the plan justify the resolution?

This algorithm assumes that the user is not interested in the values of formula_9 itself, but rather the result of applying some operator formula_12 onto x, formula_13.\nFirst, the algorithm represents the vector formula_8 as a quantum state of the form:\nNext, Hamiltonian simulation techniques are used to apply the unitary operator formula_16 to formula_17 for a superposition of different times formula_18. The ability to decompose formula_17 into the eigenbasis of formula_7 and to find the corresponding eigenvalues formula_21 is facilitated by the use of quantum phase estimation.\nThe state of the system after this decomposition is approximately:\nwhere formula_23 is the eigenvector basis of formula_7, and formula_25.\nWe would then like to perform the linear map taking formula_26 to formula_27, where formula_28 is a normalizing constant. The linear mapping operation is not unitary and thus will require a number of repetitions as it has some probability of failing. After it succeeds, we uncompute the formula_26 register and are left with a state proportional to:\nWhere formula_31 is a quantum-mechanical representation of the desired solution vector\u00a0\"x\". To read out all components of \"x\" would require the procedure be repeated at least \"N\" times. However, it is often the case that one is not interested in formula_32 itself, but rather some expectation value of a linear operator \"M\" acting on\u00a0\"x\". By mapping \"M\" to a quantum-mechanical operator and performing the quantum measurement corresponding to \"M\", we obtain an estimate of the expectation value formula_13. This allows for a wide variety of features of the vector \"x\" to be extracted including normalization, weights in different parts of the state space, and moments without actually computing all the values of the solution vector\u00a0\"x\".\n\nSection::::Explanation of the algorithm.:Initialization.\nFirstly, the algorithm requires that the matrix formula_7 be Hermitian so that it can be converted into a unitary operator. In the case where formula_7 is not Hermitian, define \nAs formula_28 is Hermitian, the algorithm can now be used to solve formula_38 to obtain formula_39.\nSecondly, The algorithm requires an efficient procedure to prepare formula_17, the quantum representation of b. It is assumed that there exists some linear operator formula_41 that can take some arbitrary quantum state formula_42 to formula_17 efficiently or that this algorithm is a subroutine in a larger algorithm and is given formula_17 as input. Any error in the preparation of state formula_17 is ignored.\nFinally, the algorithm assumes that the state formula_46 can be prepared efficiently. Where\nfor some large formula_48. The coefficients of formula_46 are chosen to minimize a certain quadratic loss function which induces error in the formula_50 subroutine described below.\n\nSection::::Explanation of the algorithm.:Hamiltonian simulation.\nHamiltonian simulation is used to transform the Hermitian matrix formula_7 into a unitary operator, which can then be applied at will. This is possible if \"A\" is \"s\"-sparse and efficiently row computable, meaning it has at most \"s\" nonzero entries per row and given a row index these entries can be computed in time\u00a0O(\"s\"). Under these assumptions, quantum Hamiltonian simulation allows formula_16 to be simulated in time formula_53.\n\nSection::::Explanation of the algorithm.:formula_50 subroutine.\nThe key subroutine to the algorithm, denoted formula_50, is defined as follows and incorporates a phase estimation subroutine:\n1. Prepare formula_56 on register \"C\"\n2. Apply the conditional Hamiltonian evolution (sum)\n3. Apply the Fourier transform to the register\u00a0\"C\".

Reverse steps 1\u20133, uncomputing any garbage produced along the way.\nThe phase estimation procedure in steps 1-3 allows for the estimation of eigenvalues of \"A\" up to error formula_60.\nThe ancilla register in step 4 is necessary to construct a final state with inverted eigenvalues corresponding to the diagonalized inverse of \"A\". In this register, the functions \"f\", \"g\", are called filter functions. The states 'nothing', 'well' and 'ill' are used to instruct the loop body on how to proceed; 'nothing' indicates that the desired matrix inversion has not yet taken place, 'well' indicates that the inversion has taken place and the loop should halt, and 'ill' indicates that part of formula_17 is in the ill-conditioned subspace of \"A\" and the algorithm will not be able to produce the desired inversion.

For simplicity let us focus on Michigan-style architecture with supervised learning. See the illustrations on the right laying out the sequential steps involved in this type of generic LCS.\n\nOne of the most critical and often time consuming elements of an LCS is the matching process. The first step in an LCS learning cycle takes a single training instance from the environment and passes it to [P] where matching takes place. In step two, every rule in [P] is now compared to the training instance to see which rules match (i.e. are contextually relevant to the current instance). In step three, any matching rules are moved to a \"match set\" [M]. A rule matches a training instance if all feature values specified in the rule condition are equivalent to the corresponding feature value in the training instance. For example, assuming the training instance is (001001 ~ 0), these rules would match: (###0## ~ 0), (00###1 ~ 0), (#01001 ~ 1), but these rules would not (1##### ~ 0), (000##1 ~ 0), (#0#1#0 ~ 1). Notice that in matching, the endpoint/action specified by the rule is not taken into consideration. As a result, the match set may contain classifiers that propose conflicting actions. In the fourth step, since we are performing supervised learning, [M] is divided into a correct set [C] and an incorrect set [I]. A matching rule goes into the correct set if it proposes the correct action (based on the known action of the training instance), otherwise it goes into [I]. In reinforcement learning LCS, an action set [A] would be formed here instead, since the correct action is not known.\n\nAt this point in the learning cycle, if no classifiers made it into either [M] or [C] (as would be the case when the population starts off empty), the covering mechanism is applied (fifth step). Covering is a form of \"online smart population initialization\". Covering randomly generates a rule that matches the current training instance (and in the case of supervised learning, that rule is also generated with the correct action. Assuming the training instance is (001001 ~ 0), covering might generate any of the following rules: (#0#0## ~ 0), (001001 ~ 0), (#010## ~ 0). Covering not only ensures that each learning cycle there is at least one correct, matching rule in [C], but that any rule initialized into the population will match at least one training instance. This prevents LCS from exploring the search space of rules that do not match any training instances.\n\nIn the sixth step, the rule parameters of any rule in [M] are updated to reflect the new experience gained from the current training instance. Depending on the LCS algorithm, a number of updates can take place at this step. For supervised learning, we can simply update the accuracy/error of a rule. Rule accuracy/error is different than model accuracy/error, since it is not calculated over the entire training data, but only over all instances that it matched. Rule accuracy is calculated by dividing the number of times the rule was in a correct set [C] by the number of times it was in a match set [M]. Rule accuracy can be thought of as a 'local accuracy'. Rule fitness is also updated here, and is commonly calculated as a function of rule accuracy."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

This algorithm assumes that the user is not interested in the values of formula_9 itself, but rather the result of applying some operator formula_12 onto x, formula_13.\nFirst, the algorithm represents the vector formula_8 as a quantum state of the form:\nNext, Hamiltonian simulation techniques are used to apply the unitary operator formula_16 to formula_17 for a superposition of different times formula_18. The ability to decompose formula_17 into the eigenbasis of formula_7 and to find the corresponding eigenvalues formula_21 is facilitated by the use of quantum phase estimation.\nThe state of the system after this decomposition is approximately:\nwhere formula_23 is the eigenvector basis of formula_7, and formula_25.\nWe would then like to perform the linear map taking formula_26 to formula_27, where formula_28 is a normalizing constant.

To read out all components of \"x\" would require the procedure be repeated at least \"N\" times. However, it is often the case that one is not interested in formula_32 itself, but rather some expectation value of a linear operator \"M\" acting on \"x\". By mapping \"M\" to a quantum-mechanical operator and performing the quantum measurement corresponding to \"M\", we obtain an estimate of the expectation value formula_13. This allows for a wide variety of features of the vector \"x\" to be extracted including normalization, weights in different parts of the state space, and moments without actually computing all the values of the solution vector \"x\".\nSection::::Explanation of the algorithm.\nSection::::Explanation of the algorithm.:Initialization.\nFirstly, the algorithm requires that the matrix formula_7 be Hermitian so that it can be converted into a unitary operator. In the case where formula_7 is not Hermitian, define \nAs formula_28 is Hermitian, the algorithm can now be used to solve formula_38 to obtain formula_39.\nSecondly, The algorithm requires an efficient procedure to prepare formula_17, the quantum representation of b. It is assumed that there exists some linear operator formula_41 that can take some arbitrary quantum state formula_42 to formula_17 efficiently or that this algorithm is a subroutine in a larger algorithm and is given formula_17 as input. Any error in the preparation of state formula_17 is ignored.\nFinally, the algorithm assumes that the state formula_46 can be prepared efficiently. Where\nfor some large formula_48. The coefficients of formula_46 are chosen to minimize a certain quadratic loss function which induces error in the formula_50 subroutine described below.\nSection::::Explanation of the algorithm.:Hamiltonian simulation.\nHamiltonian simulation is used to transform the Hermitian matrix formula_7 into a unitary operator, which can then be applied at will. This is possible if \"A\" is \"s\"-sparse and efficiently row computable, meaning it has at most \"s\" nonzero entries per row and given a row index these entries can be computed in time O(\"s\"). Under these assumptions, quantum Hamiltonian simulation allows formula_16 to be simulated in time formula_53.\nSection::::Explanation of the algorithm.:formula_50 subroutine.\nThe key subroutine to the algorithm, denoted formula_50, is defined as follows and incorporates a phase estimation subroutine:\n1. Prepare formula_56 on register \"C\"\n2. Apply the conditional Hamiltonian evolution (sum)\n3. Apply the Fourier transform to the register \"C\". Denote the resulting basis states with formula_57 for \"k\" = 0, ..., \"T\" \u2212 1. Define formula_58.\n4. Adjoin a three-dimensional register \"S\" in the state\n5. Reverse steps 1\u20133, uncomputing any garbage produced along the way.\nThe phase estimation procedure in steps 1-3 allows for the estimation of eigenvalues of \"A\" up to error formula_60.\nThe ancilla register in step 4 is necessary to construct a final state with inverted eigenvalues corresponding to the diagonalized inverse of \"A\". In this register, the functions \"f\", \"g\", are called filter functions. The states 'nothing', 'well' and 'ill' are used to instruct the loop body on how to proceed; 'nothing' indicates that the desired matrix inversion has not yet taken place, 'well' indicates that the inversion has taken place and the loop should halt, and 'ill' indicates that part of formula_17 is in the ill-conditioned subspace of \"A\" and the algorithm will not be able to produce the desired inversion. Producing a state proportional to the inverse of \"A\" requires 'well' to be measured, after which the overall state of the system collapses to the desired state by the extended Born rule.\nSection::::Explanation of the algorithm.:Main loop.\nThe body of the algorithm follows the amplitude amplification procedure: starting with formula_62, the following operation is repeatedly applied:\nwhere\nand\nAfter each repetition, formula_66 is measured and will produce a value of 'nothing', 'well', or 'ill' as described above. This loop is repeated until formula_66 is measured, which occurs with a probability formula_68. Rather than repeating formula_69 times to minimize error, amplitude amplification is used to achieve the same error resilience using only formula_70 repetitions.\nSection::::Explanation of the algorithm.:Scalar measurement.\nAfter successfully measuring 'well' on formula_66 the system will be in a state proportional to:\nFinally, we perform the quantum-mechanical operator corresponding to M and obtain an estimate of the value of formula_13."], "wikipedia-5229194": ["BULLET::::1.

It can be an offline, finite training dataset (characteristic of a data mining, classification, or regression problem), or an online sequential stream of live training instances. Each training instance is assumed to include some number of \"features\" (also referred to as \"attributes\", or \"independent variables\"), and a single \"endpoint\" of interest (also referred to as the class, \"action\", \"phenotype\", \"prediction\", or \"dependent variable\"). Part of LCS learning can involve feature selection, therefore not all of the features in the training data need be informative. The set of feature values of an instance is commonly referred to as the \"state\". For simplicity let's assume an example problem domain with Boolean/binary features and a Boolean/binary class. For Michigan-style systems, one instance from the environment is trained on each learning cycle (i.e. incremental learning). Pittsburgh-style systems perform batch learning, where rule-sets are evaluated each iteration over much or all of the training data.\nSection::::Methodology.:Elements of a generic LCS algorithm.:Rule/classifier/population.\nA rule is a context dependent relationship between state values and some prediction. Rules typically take the form of an {IF:THEN} expression, (e.g. {\"IF 'condition' THEN 'action'},\" or as a more specific example, \"{IF 'red' AND 'octagon' THEN 'stop-sign'}\"). A critical concept in LCS and rule-based machine learning alike, is that an individual rule is not in itself a model, since the rule is only applicable when its condition is satisfied. Think of a rule as a \"local-model\" of the solution space.\nRules can be represented in many different ways to handle different data types (e.g. binary, discrete-valued, ordinal, continuous-valued). Given binary data LCS traditionally applies a ternary rule representation (i.e. rules can include either a 0, 1, or '#' for each feature in the data). The 'don't care' symbol (i.e. '#') serves as a wild card within a rule's condition allowing rules, and the system as a whole to generalize relationships between features and the target endpoint to be predicted. Consider the following rule (#1###0 ~ 1) (i.e. condition ~ action). This rule can be interpreted as: IF the second feature = 1 AND the sixth feature = 0 THEN the class prediction = 1. We would say that the second and sixth features were specified in this rule, while the others were generalized. This rule, and the corresponding prediction are only applicable to an instance when the condition of the rule is satisfied by the instance. This is more commonly referred to as matching. In Michigan-style LCS, each rule has its own fitness, as well as a number of other rule-parameters associated with it that can describe the number of copies of that rule that exist (i.e. the \"numerosity\"), the age of the rule, its accuracy, or the accuracy of its reward predictions, and other descriptive or experiential statistics. A rule along with its parameters is often referred to as a \"classifier\". In Michigan-style systems, classifiers are contained within a \"population\" [P] that has a user defined maximum number of classifiers. Unlike most stochastic search algorithms (e.g. evolutionary algorithms), LCS populations start out empty (i.e. there is no need to randomly initialize a rule population). Classifiers will instead be initially introduced to the population with a covering mechanism.\nIn any LCS, the trained model is a set of rules/classifiers, rather than any single rule/classifier. In Michigan-style LCS, the entire trained (and optionally, compacted) classifier population forms the prediction model.\nSection::::Methodology.:Elements of a generic LCS algorithm.:Matching.\nOne of the most critical and often time consuming elements of an LCS is the matching process. The first step in an LCS learning cycle takes a single training instance from the environment and passes it to [P] where matching takes place.

In step three, any matching rules are moved to a \"match set\" [M]. A rule matches a training instance if all feature values specified in the rule condition are equivalent to the corresponding feature value in the training instance. For example, assuming the training instance is (001001 ~ 0), these rules would match: (###0## ~ 0), (00###1 ~ 0), (#01001 ~ 1), but these rules would not (1##### ~ 0), (000##1 ~ 0), (#0#1#0 ~ 1). Notice that in matching, the endpoint/action specified by the rule is not taken into consideration. As a result, the match set may contain classifiers that propose conflicting actions. In the fourth step, since we are performing supervised learning, [M] is divided into a correct set [C] and an incorrect set [I]. A matching rule goes into the correct set if it proposes the correct action (based on the known action of the training instance), otherwise it goes into [I]. In reinforcement learning LCS, an action set [A] would be formed here instead, since the correct action is not known.\nSection::::Methodology.:Elements of a generic LCS algorithm.:Covering.\nAt this point in the learning cycle, if no classifiers made it into either [M] or [C] (as would be the case when the population starts off empty), the covering mechanism is applied (fifth step).

To obtain the average-case complexity, given an input distribution, the expected time of an algorithm is evaluated, whereas for the almost always complexity estimate, it is evaluated that the algorithm admits a given complexity estimate that almost surely holds.\nIn probabilistic analysis of probabilistic (randomized) algorithms, the distributions or averaging for all possible choices in randomized steps are also taken into an account, in addition to the input distributions."], "wikipedia-405944": ["Time complexity\nIn computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to differ by at most a constant factor.\nSince an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input. Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases\u2014that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity. Therefore, the time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation, typically formula_1\nformula_2 formula_3 formula_4 etc., where is the input size in units of bits needed to represent the input.\nAlgorithmic complexities are classified according to the type of function appearing in the big O notation. For example, an algorithm with time complexity formula_5 is a \"linear time algorithm\" and an algorithm with time complexity formula_6 for some constant formula_7 is a \"polynomial time algorithm\"."], "wikipedia-22553927": ["In the absence of empirical algorithmics, analyzing the complexity of an algorithm can involve various theoretical methods applicable to various situations in which the algorithm may be used. Memory and cache considerations are often significant factors to be considered in the theoretical choice of a complex algorithm, or the approach to its optimization, for a given purpose. Performance profiling is a dynamic program analysis technique typically used for finding and analyzing bottlenecks in an entire application's code or for analyzing an entire application to identify poorly performing code. A profiler can reveal the code most relevant to an application's performance issues.\nA profiler may help to determine when to choose one algorithm over another in a particular situation. When an individual algorithm is profiled, as with complexity analysis, memory and cache considerations are often more significant than instruction counts or clock cycles; however, the profiler's findings can be considered in light of how the algorithm accesses data rather than the number of instructions it uses."], "wikipedia-7543": ["The \"time required\" by a deterministic Turing machine \"M\" on input \"x\" is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer (\"yes\" or \"no\").

From each stratum, three random regions were chosen for the pilot project. For those strata underrepresented by the manual picks, a fourth region was chosen, resulting in a total of 30 regions. For all strata, a \"backup\" region was designated for use in the event of unforeseen technical problems."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-49780017": 1, "wikipedia-1615196": 1, "wikipedia-3071612": 1, "wikipedia-9676678": 1, "wikipedia-30931454": 1, "wikipedia-10456890": 1, "wikipedia-3115869": 1, "wikipedia-2465352": 1, "wikipedia-2140955": 1, "wikipedia-97168": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-49780017": 1, "wikipedia-1615196": 1, "wikipedia-3071612": 1, "wikipedia-9676678": 1, "wikipedia-30931454": 1, "wikipedia-10456890": 1, "wikipedia-3115869": 1, "wikipedia-2465352": 1, "wikipedia-2140955": 2, "wikipedia-97168": 1}}}

Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is either the set of the natural numbers (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first \"n\" natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length \"n\"). The position of an element in a sequence is its \"rank\" or \"index\"; it is the natural number from which the element is the image. It depends on the context or a specific convention, if the first element has index 0 or 1. When a symbol has been chosen for denoting a sequence, the \"n\"th element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with \"n\" as subscript; for example, the \"n\"th element of the Fibonacci sequence is generally denoted \"F\".\nFor example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter 'M' first and 'Y' last. This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y). Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence. Sequences can be \"finite\", as in these examples, or \"infinite\", such as the sequence of all even positive integers (2, 4, 6, ...). In computing and computer science, finite sequences are sometimes called strings, words or lists, the different names commonly corresponding to different ways to represent them in computer memory; infinite sequences are called streams. The empty sequence ( ) is included in most notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context.\nSection::::Examples and notation.\nA sequence can be thought of as a list of elements with a particular order. Sequences are useful in a number of mathematical disciplines for studying functions, spaces, and other mathematical structures using the convergence properties of sequences. In particular, sequences are the basis for series, which are important in differential equations and analysis. Sequences are also of interest in their own right and can be studied as patterns or puzzles, such as in the study of prime numbers.\nThere are a number of ways to denote a sequence, some of which are more useful for specific types of sequences. One way to specify a sequence is to list the elements. For example, the first four odd numbers form the sequence (1, 3, 5, 7). This notation can be used for infinite sequences as well. For instance, the infinite sequence of positive odd integers can be written (1, 3, 5, 7, ...). Listing is most useful for infinite sequences with a pattern that can be easily discerned from the first few elements. Other ways to denote a sequence are discussed after the examples.\nSection::::Examples and notation.:Indexing.\nOther notations can be useful for sequences whose pattern cannot be easily guessed, or for sequences that do not have a pattern such as the digits of . One such notation is to write down a general formula for computing the \"n\"th term as a function of \"n\", enclose it in parentheses, and include a subscript indicating the range of values that \"n\" can take. For example, in this notation the sequence of even numbers could be written as formula_1. The sequence of squares could be written as formula_2. The variable \"n\" is called an index, and the set of values that it can take is called the index set.\nIt is often useful to combine this notation with the technique of treating the elements of a sequence as variables. This yields expressions like formula_3, which denotes a sequence whose \"n\"th element is given by the variable formula_4. For example:\nNote that we can consider multiple sequences at the same time by using different variables; e.g. formula_6 could be a different sequence than formula_3. We can even consider a sequence of sequences: formula_8 denotes a sequence whose \"m\"th term is the sequence formula_9.\nAn alternative to writing the domain of a sequence in the subscript is to indicate the range of values that the index can take by listing its highest and lowest legal values. For example, the notation formula_10 denotes the ten-term sequence of squares formula_11. The limits formula_12 and formula_13 are allowed, but they do not represent valid values for the index, only the supremum or infimum of such values, respectively. For example, the sequence formula_14 is the same as the sequence formula_3, and does not contain an additional term \"at infinity\". The sequence formula_16 is a bi-infinite sequence, and can also be written as formula_17.\nIn cases where the set of indexing numbers is understood, the subscripts and superscripts are often left off. That is, one simply writes formula_18 for an arbitrary sequence. Often, the index \"k\" is understood to run from 1 to \u221e. However, sequences are frequently indexed starting from zero, as in\nIn some cases the elements of the sequence are related naturally to a sequence of integers whose pattern can be easily inferred. In these cases the index set may be implied by a listing of the first few abstract elements. For instance, the sequence of squares of odd numbers could be denoted in any of the following ways.\nBULLET::::- formula_20\nBULLET::::- formula_21\nBULLET::::- formula_22\nBULLET::::- formula_23\nBULLET::::- formula_24\nMoreover, the subscripts and superscripts could have been left off in the third, fourth, and fifth notations, if the indexing set was understood to be the natural numbers. Note that in the second and third bullets, there is a well-defined sequence formula_25, but it is not the same as the sequence denoted by the expression."], "wikipedia-433875": ["Suppose we are given a covariant left exact functor \"F\" : A \u2192 B between two abelian categories A and B.

Simon exhibited a quantum algorithm, usually called Simon's algorithm, that solves the problem exponentially faster than any deterministic or probabilistic classical algorithm, requiring exponentially less computation time (or more precisely, queries) than the best classical probabilistic algorithm.\nThis problem yields an oracle separation between the complexity classes BPP and BQP, unlike the separation provided by the Deutsch\u2013Jozsa algorithm, which separates P and EQP. \nSimon's algorithm was also the inspiration for Shor's algorithm.

The organisation needs to understand the possible market dynamics in order to design marketing and production plans.\n\nSection::::Topics in systems dynamics.:Causal loop diagrams.\nIn the system dynamics methodology, a problem or a system (e.g., ecosystem, political system or mechanical system) may be represented as a causal loop diagram. A causal loop diagram is a simple map of a system with all its constituent components and their interactions. By capturing interactions and consequently the feedback loops (see figure below), a causal loop diagram reveals the structure of a system. By understanding the structure of a system, it becomes possible to ascertain a system\u2019s behavior over a certain time period.\nThe causal loop diagram of the new product introduction may look as follows:\nThere are two feedback loops in this diagram. The positive reinforcement (labeled R) loop on the right indicates that the more people have already adopted the new product, the stronger the word-of-mouth impact. There will be more references to the product, more demonstrations, and more reviews. This positive feedback should generate sales that continue to grow.\nThe second feedback loop on the left is negative reinforcement (or \"balancing\" and hence labeled B). Clearly, growth cannot continue forever, because as more and more people adopt, there remain fewer and fewer potential adopters.\nBoth feedback loops act simultaneously, but at different times they may have different strengths. Thus one might expect growing sales in the initial years, and then declining sales in the later years. However, in general a causal loop diagram does not specify the structure of a system sufficiently to permit determination of its behavior from the visual representation alone.\n\nSection::::Topics in systems dynamics.:Stock and flow diagrams.\nCausal loop diagrams aid in visualizing a system\u2019s structure and behavior, and analyzing the system qualitatively. To perform a more detailed quantitative analysis, a causal loop diagram is transformed to a stock and flow diagram. A stock and flow model helps in studying and analyzing the system in a quantitative way; such models are usually built and simulated using computer software.\nA stock is the term for any entity that accumulates or depletes over time. A flow is the rate of change in a stock.\nIn our example, there are two stocks: Potential adopters and Adopters. There is one flow: New adopters. For every new adopter, the stock of potential adopters declines by one, and the stock of adopters increases by one.\n\nSection::::Topics in systems dynamics.:Equations.\nThe real power of system dynamics is utilised through simulation. Although it is possible to perform the modeling in a spreadsheet, there are a variety of software packages that have been optimised for this.\nThe steps involved in a simulation are:\nBULLET::::- Define the problem boundary\nBULLET::::- Identify the most important stocks and flows that change these stock levels\nBULLET::::- Identify sources of information that impact the flows\nBULLET::::- Identify the main feedback loops\nBULLET::::- Draw a causal loop diagram that links the stocks, flows and sources of information\nBULLET::::- Write the equations that determine the flows\nBULLET::::- Estimate the parameters and initial conditions.

This produces M in terms of ft, and is given by the equation: \nMomentum is one of the most important basic definitions in Fluid Mechanics. The conservation of momentum is one of the three fundamental physical principles in both Fluid Mechanics and [Open-channel flow | open channel flow] (the other two are mass conservation and energy conservation). This principle leads to the momentum equation set in three dimensions (x, y and z). With different assumptions, these momentum equations can be simplified to several widely applied forms:\nWith Newton\u2019s second law, Newtonian fluids assumption and Stokes hypothesis, the original fluid momentum equations are derived as the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. These equations are classic in Fluid Mechanics, but the nonlinearity in these partial differential equations make them difficult to solve mathematically. As a result, analytical solutions for the Navier\u2013Stokes equations still remain a tough research topic.\nFor high Reynolds number flow, the effects of viscosity are negligible. In these cases, with the inviscid assumption, Navier\u2013Stokes equations can be derived as Euler equations. Though they are still nonlinear partial differential equations, the elimination of viscous terms simplifies the problem.\nIn some applications, when viscosity, rotationality and compressibility of the fluid can be neglected, the Navier\u2013Stokes equations can be further simplified to the Laplace equation form, which is referred as potential flow.\nIn computational fluid dynamics, solving the partial differential momentum equations mentioned above with discretized algebraic equations is the most important procedure to study flow characteristics in different applications.\nMomentum also allows us to describe the characteristics of flow when energy is not conserved. HEC-RAS, a widely used computer model developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers for calculating water surface profiles, considers that when flow passes through critical depth, the basic assumption of gradually varied flow required for the Energy Equation is not applicable. Locations where flow may make such a transition include: significant changes in slope, channel geometry (e.g. bridge sections), grade control structures, and the confluence of water bodies. In these instances, HEC-RAS will use a form of the momentum equation to solve for the water surface elevation at an unknown location.\nIn addition, momentum flux is one of the parameters to estimate fluid impact on offshore structures. Analysis of momentum flux in coastal regions can provide advisable infrastructure layout planning to minimize the potential hazards from extreme events such as storm surge, hurricane and tsunami (e.g. (Park et al. 2013), (Yeh 2006), (Guard et al. 2005) and (Chanson et al. 2002))."], "wikipedia-40995216": ["In physics and mathematics, the spacetime triangle diagram (STTD) technique, also known as the Smirnov method of incomplete separation of variables, is the direct space-time domain method for electromagnetic and scalar wave motion."], "wikipedia-48395": ["Navier\u2013Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest.

Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input. Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases\u2014that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity.

In a similar manner, finding the minimal value in an array sorted in ascending order; it is the first element.

Once all of the leading coefficients (the leftmost nonzero entry in each row) are 1, and every column containing a leading coefficient has zeros elsewhere, the matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form. This final form is unique; in other words, it is independent of the sequence of row operations used.\n\nThe process of row reduction makes use of elementary row operations, and can be divided into two parts. The first part (sometimes called forward elimination) reduces a given system to 'row echelon form,' from which one can tell whether there are no solutions, a unique solution, or infinitely many solutions. The second part (sometimes called back substitution) continues to use row operations until the solution is found; in other words, it puts the matrix into 'reduced' row echelon form.\n\nThere are three types of elementary row operations which may be performed on the rows of a matrix: BULLET::::1. Swap the positions of two rows. BULLET::::2. Multiply a row by a non-zero scalar. BULLET::::3. Add to one row a scalar multiple of another. If the matrix is associated to a system of linear equations, then these operations do not change the solution set. Therefore, if one's goal is to solve a system of linear equations, then using these row operations could make the problem easier.\n\nFor example, the following matrix is in row echelon form, and its leading coefficients are shown in red: It is in echelon form because the zero row is at the bottom, and the leading coefficient of the second row (in the third column), is to the right of the leading coefficient of the first row (in the second column). A matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form if furthermore all of the leading coefficients are equal to 1 (which can be achieved by using the elementary row operation of type 2), and in every column containing a leading coefficient, all of the other entries in that column are zero (which can be achieved by using elementary row operations of type 3)."], "wikipedia-53357095": ["For each item, we create 1 loaf of bread (or other food).\nInitially, each agent goes to the loaf of his favorite item and starts eating it.

This fact is the key point that gives rise to an efficient algorithm - we can solve the linear system.\nIt is natural to ask how large is the dimension of the solution? Is there any upper bound on the dimension? Having an upper bound is very important in constructing an efficient list decoding algorithm because one can simply output all the codewords for any given decoding problem.\nActually it indeed has an upper bound as below lemma argues.\nThis lemma shows us the upper bound of the dimension for the solution space.\nFinally, based on the above analysis, we have below theorem\nWhen formula_144, we notice that this reduces to a unique decoding algorithm with up to a fraction formula_145 of errors. In other words, we can treat unique decoding algorithm as a specialty of list decoding algorithm. The quantity is about formula_146 for the parameter choices that achieve a list decoding radius of formula_81.\nTheorem 1 tells us exactly how large the error radius would be.\nNow we finally get the solution subspace. However, there is still one problem standing. The list size in the worst case is formula_148. But the actual list of close-by codewords is only a small set within that subspace. So we need some process to prune the subspace to narrow it down. This prune process takes formula_85 time in the worst case. Unfortunately it is not known how to improve the running time because we do not know how to improve the bound of the list size for folded Reed-Solomon code.\nThings get better if we change the code by carefully choosing a subset of all possible degree formula_150 polynomials as messages, the list size shows to be much smaller while only losing a little bit in the rate. We will talk about this briefly in next step.\nSection::::Linear-algebraic list decoding algorithm.:Step 3: The prune step.\nBy converting the problem of decoding a folded Reed\u2013Solomon code into two linear systems, one linear system that is used for the interpolation step and another linear system to find the candidate solution subspace, the complexity of the decoding problem is successfully reduced to quadratic. However, in the worst case, the bound of list size of the output is pretty bad.\nIt was mentioned in Step 2 that if one carefully chooses only a subset of all possible degree formula_150 polynomials as messages, the list size can be much reduced. Here we will expand our discussion.\nTo achieve this goal, the idea is to limit the coefficient vector formula_152 to a special subset formula_153, which satisfies below two conditions:\nThis is to make sure that the rate will be at most reduced by factor of formula_156.\nThe bound for the list size at worst case is formula_148, and it can be reduced to a relative small bound formula_163 by using subspace-evasive subsets.\nDuring this step, as it has to check each element of the solution subspace that we get from Step 2, it takes formula_85 time in the worst case (formula_159 is the dimension of the solution subspace).\nDvir and Lovett improved the result based on the work of Guruswami, which can reduce the list size to a constant.\nHere is only presented the idea that is used to prune the solution subspace.

For example, in the following sequence of row operations (where multiple elementary operations might be done at each step), the third and fourth matrices are the ones in row echelon form, and the final matrix is the unique reduced row echelon form.\nUsing row operations to convert a matrix into reduced row echelon form is sometimes called Gauss\u2013Jordan elimination. Some authors use the term Gaussian elimination to refer to the process until it has reached its upper triangular, or (unreduced) row echelon form. For computational reasons, when solving systems of linear equations, it is sometimes preferable to stop row operations before the matrix is completely reduced.\nSection::::Definitions and example of algorithm.\nThe process of row reduction makes use of elementary row operations, and can be divided into two parts. The first part (sometimes called forward elimination) reduces a given system to \"row echelon form\", from which one can tell whether there are no solutions, a unique solution, or infinitely many solutions. The second part (sometimes called back substitution) continues to use row operations until the solution is found; in other words, it puts the matrix into \"reduced\" row echelon form.\nAnother point of view, which turns out to be very useful to analyze the algorithm, is that row reduction produces a matrix decomposition of the original matrix. The elementary row operations may be viewed as the multiplication on the left of the original matrix by elementary matrices. Alternatively, a sequence of elementary operations that reduces a single row may be viewed as multiplication by a Frobenius matrix. Then the first part of the algorithm computes an LU decomposition, while the second part writes the original matrix as the product of a uniquely determined invertible matrix and a uniquely determined reduced row echelon matrix.\nSection::::Definitions and example of algorithm.:Row operations.\nThere are three types of elementary row operations which may be performed on the rows of a matrix:\nBULLET::::1.

Therefore, if one's goal is to solve a system of linear equations, then using these row operations could make the problem easier.\nSection::::Definitions and example of algorithm.:Echelon form.\nFor each row in a matrix, if the row does not consist of only zeros, then the leftmost nonzero entry is called the \"leading coefficient\" (or \"pivot\") of that row. So if two leading coefficients are in the same column, then a row operation of type 3 could be used to make one of those coefficients zero. Then by using the row swapping operation, one can always order the rows so that for every non-zero row, the leading coefficient is to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above. If this is the case, then matrix is said to be in row echelon form. So the lower left part of the matrix contains only zeros, and all of the zero rows are below the non-zero rows. The word \"echelon\" is used here because one can roughly think of the rows being ranked by their size, with the largest being at the top and the smallest being at the bottom.\nFor example, the following matrix is in row echelon form, and its leading coefficients are shown in red:\nIt is in echelon form because the zero row is at the bottom, and the leading coefficient of the second row (in the third column), is to the right of the leading coefficient of the first row (in the second column).\nA matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form if furthermore all of the leading coefficients are equal to 1 (which can be achieved by using the elementary row operation of type 2), and in every column containing a leading coefficient, all of the other entries in that column are zero (which can be achieved by using elementary row operations of type 3).\nSection::::Definitions and example of algorithm.:Example of the algorithm.\nSuppose the goal is to find and describe the set of solutions to the following system of linear equations:\nThe table below is the row reduction process applied simultaneously to the system of equations and its associated augmented matrix. In practice, one does not usually deal with the systems in terms of equations, but instead makes use of the augmented matrix, which is more suitable for computer manipulations. The row reduction procedure may be summarized as follows: eliminate from all equations below , and then eliminate from all equations below . This will put the system into triangular form. Then, using back-substitution, each unknown can be solved for.\nThe second column describes which row operations have just been performed. So for the first step, the is eliminated from by adding to .

In 1882, wrote the book titled \"Linear Algebra\". Lord Kelvin's aetheric atom theory (1860s) led Peter Guthrie Tait, in 1885, to publish a topological table of knots with up to ten crossings known as the Tait conjectures. In 1893, Heinrich M. Weber gave the clear definition of an abstract field. Tensor calculus was developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro between 1887\u201396, presented in 1892 under the title \"absolute differential calculus\", and the contemporary usage of \"tensor\" was stated by Woldemar Voigt in 1898. In 1895, Henri Poincar\u00e9 published \"Analysis Situs\". In 1897, Charles Proteus Steinmetz would publish , with the assistance of Ernst J. Berg.\nSection::::Symbolic stage.:High division operators and functions.:From formula mathematics to tensors.\nIn 1895 Giuseppe Peano issued his \"Formulario mathematico\", an effort to digest mathematics into terse text based on special symbols. He would provide a definition of a vector space and linear map. He would also introduce the intersection sign, the union sign, the membership sign (is an element of), and existential quantifier (there exists). Peano would pass to Bertrand Russell his work in 1900 at a Paris conference; it so impressed Russell that Russell too was taken with the drive to render mathematics more concisely. The result was Principia Mathematica written with Alfred North Whitehead. This treatise marks a watershed in modern literature where symbol became dominant. Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita popularized the tensor index notation around 1900.\nSection::::Symbolic stage.:Mathematical logic and abstraction.\nAt the beginning of this period, Felix Klein's \"Erlangen program\" identified the underlying theme of various geometries, defining each of them as the study of properties invariant under a given group of symmetries. This level of abstraction revealed connections between geometry and abstract algebra. Georg Cantor would introduce the aleph symbol for cardinal numbers of transfinite sets. His notation for the cardinal numbers was the Hebrew letter formula_16 (aleph) with a natural number subscript; for the ordinals he employed the Greek letter \u03c9 (omega). This notation is still in use today in ordinal notation of a finite sequence of symbols from a finite alphabet which names an ordinal number according to some scheme which gives meaning to the language. His theory created a great deal of controversy. Cantor would, in his study of Fourier series, consider point sets in Euclidean space.\nAfter the turn of the 20th century, Josiah Willard Gibbs would in physical chemistry introduce middle dot for dot product and the multiplication sign for cross products. He would also supply notation for the scalar and vector products, which was introduced in \"Vector Analysis\". In 1904, Ernst Zermelo promotes axiom of choice and his proof of the well-ordering theorem. Bertrand Russell would shortly afterward introduce logical disjunction (OR) in 1906. Also in 1906, Poincar\u00e9 would publish \"On the Dynamics of the Electron\" and Maurice Fr\u00e9chet introduced metric space. Later, Gerhard Kowalewski and Cuthbert Edmund Cullis would successively introduce matrices notation, parenthetical matrix and box matrix notation respectively. After 1907, mathematicians studied knots from the point of view of the knot group and invariants from homology theory. In 1908, Joseph Wedderburn's structure theorems were formulated for finite-dimensional algebras over a field. Also in 1908, Ernst Zermelo proposed \"definite\" property and the first axiomatic set theory, Zermelo set theory. In 1910 Ernst Steinitz published the influential paper \"Algebraic Theory of Fields\". In 1911, Steinmetz would publish \"Theory and Calculation of Transient Electric Phenomena and Oscillations\".\nAlbert Einstein, in 1916, introduced the Einstein notation which summed over a set of indexed terms in a formula, thus exerting notational brevity. Arnold Sommerfeld would create the contour integral sign in 1917. Also in 1917, Dimitry Mirimanoff proposes axiom of regularity. In 1919, Theodor Kaluza would solve general relativity equations using five dimensions, the results would have electromagnetic equations emerge. This would be published in 1921 in \"Zum Unit\u00e4tsproblem der Physik\". In 1922, Abraham Fraenkel and Thoralf Skolem independently proposed replacing the axiom schema of specification with the axiom schema of replacement. Also in 1922, Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory was developed. In 1923, Steinmetz would publish \"Four Lectures on Relativity and Space\". Around 1924, Jan Arnoldus Schouten would develop the modern notation and formalism for the Ricci calculus framework during the absolute differential calculus applications to general relativity and differential geometry in the early twentieth century. In 1925, Enrico Fermi would describe a system comprising many identical particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle, afterwards developing a diffusion equation (Fermi age equation). In 1926, Oskar Klein would develop the Kaluza\u2013Klein theory. In 1928, Emil Artin abstracted ring theory with Artinian rings. In 1933, Andrey Kolmogorov introduces the \"Kolmogorov axioms\". In 1937, Bruno de Finetti deduced the \"operational subjective\" concept.\nSection::::Symbolic stage.:Mathematical logic and abstraction.:Mathematical symbolism.\nMathematical abstraction began as a process of extracting the underlying essence of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena. Two abstract areas of modern mathematics are category theory and model theory. Bertrand Russell, said, \"\"Ordinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what physics really asserts, since the words of everyday life are not sufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say as little as the physicist means to say\"\". Though, one can substituted mathematics for real world objects, and wander off through equation after equation, and can build a concept structure which has no relation to reality.\nSymbolic logic studies the purely formal properties of strings of symbols. The interest in this area springs from two sources. First, the notation used in symbolic logic can be seen as representing the words used in philosophical logic. Second, the rules for manipulating symbols found in symbolic logic can be implemented on a computing machine. Symbolic logic is usually divided into two subfields, propositional logic and predicate logic. Other logics of interest include temporal logic, modal logic and fuzzy logic. The area of symbolic logic called propositional logic, also called \"propositional calculus\", studies the properties of sentences formed from constants and logical operators. The corresponding logical operations are known, respectively, as conjunction, disjunction, material conditional, biconditional, and negation. These operators are denoted as keywords and by symbolic notation.\nSome of the introduced mathematical logic notation during this time included the set of symbols used in Boolean algebra. This was created by George Boole in 1854. Boole himself did not see logic as a branch of mathematics, but it has come to be encompassed anyway. Symbols found in Boolean algebra include formula_17 (AND), formula_18 (OR), and formula_19 (\"not\"). With these symbols, and letters to represent different truth values, one can make logical statements such as formula_20, that is \"(\"a\" is true OR \"a\" is \"not\" true) is true\", meaning it is true that \"a\" is either true or not true (i.e. false). Boolean algebra has many practical uses as it is, but it also was the start of what would be a large set of symbols to be used in logic. Predicate logic, originally called \"predicate calculus\", expands on propositional logic by the introduction of variables and by sentences containing variables, called predicates. In addition, predicate logic allows quantifiers. With these logic symbols and additional quantifiers from predicate logic, valid proofs can be made that are irrationally artificial, but syntactical.\nSection::::Symbolic stage.:G\u00f6del incompleteness notation.\nWhile proving his incompleteness theorems, Kurt G\u00f6del created an alternative to the symbols normally used in logic. He used G\u00f6del numbers, which were numbers that represented operations with set numbers, and variables with the prime numbers greater than 10. With G\u00f6del numbers, logic statements can be broken down into a number sequence. G\u00f6del then took this one step farther, taking the \"n\" prime numbers and putting them to the power of the numbers in the sequence. These numbers were then multiplied together to get the final product, giving every logic statement its own number.\nSection::::Symbolic stage.:Contemporary notation and topics.\nSection::::Symbolic stage.:Contemporary notation and topics.:Early 20th-century notation.\nAbstraction of notation is an ongoing process and the historical development of many mathematical topics exhibits a progression from the concrete to the abstract. Various set notations would be developed for fundamental object sets. Around 1924, David Hilbert and Richard Courant published \"Methods of mathematical physics. Partial differential equations\". In 1926, Oskar Klein and Walter Gordon proposed"], "wikipedia-1982652": ["Typographical conventions in mathematical formulae provide uniformity across mathematical texts and help the readers of those texts to grasp new concepts quickly.\nMathematical notation includes letters from various alphabets, as well as special mathematical symbols. Letters in various fonts often have specific, fixed meanings in particular areas of mathematics. A mathematical article or a theorem typically starts from the definitions of the introduced symbols, such as: \"Let \"G\" = (\"V\",\u00a0\"E\") be a graph with the vertex set \"V\" and edge set \"E\"...\". Theoretically it is admissible to write \"Let \"X\" = (\"a\", \"q\") be a graph with the vertex set \"a\" and edge set \"q\"...\"; however, this would decrease readability, since the reader has to consciously memorize these unusual notations in a limited context.\nUsage of subscripts and superscripts is also an important convention. In the early days of computers with limited graphical capabilities for text, subscripts and superscripts were represented with the help of additional notation. In particular, \"n\" could be written as n^2 or n**2 (the latter borrowed from FORTRAN) and \"n\" could be written as n_2.\nVarious international authorities, including IUPAC, NIST and ISO have produced similar recommendations with regard to typesetting variables and other mathematical symbols (whether in equations or otherwise).\nIn general, anything that represents a variable (for example, \"h\" for a patient's height) should be set in italic, and everything else should be set in roman type. This applies equally to characters from the Latin/English alphabet (a, b, c, ...; A, B, C, ...) as to letters from any other alphabet, most notably Greek (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, ...; \u0391, \u0392, \u0393, ...). Any operator, such as cos (representing cosine) or \u2211 (representing summation), should therefore be set roman. Note that each element must be set depending upon its own merits, including subscripts and superscripts. Thus, \"h\" would be suitable for the initial height, while \"h\" would represent one instance from a set of heights (\"h\", \"h\", \"h\", ...). Notice that numbers (1, 2, 3, \"etc.\") are not variables, and so are always set roman. Likewise, in some special cases symbols are used to represent general constants, such as \u03c0 used to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and such general constants can be set in roman. (This does not apply to parameters which are merely chosen to not vary.) \nFor vectors, matrices and tensors, it is recommended to set the variable itself in boldface (excluding any associated subscripts or superscripts). Hence, u would be suitable for the initial velocity, while u\" would represent one instance from a set of velocities (u, u, u\", ...). Italic is still used for variables, both for lowercase and for uppercase symbols (Latin, Greek, or otherwise). The only general situation where italic is not used for bolded symbols is for vector operators, such as \u2207 (nabla), set bold and roman.\nThe rules of mathematical typography differ from country to country; thus, American mathematical journals and books will tend to use slightly different conventions from those of European journals.\nOne advantage of mathematical notation is its modularity\u2014it is possible to write extremely complicated formulae involving multiple levels of super- or subscripting, and multiple levels of fraction bars. However, it is considered poor style to set up a formula in such a way as to leave more than a certain number of levels; for example, in non-math publications might be rewritten as Incidentally, the above formula demonstrates the American rule that italic type is used for all letters representing variables and parameters except uppercase Greek letters, which are in upright type. Upright type is also standard for digits and punctuation; currently, the ISO-mandated style of using upright for constants (such as e, i) is not widespread. Bold Latin capital letters usually represent matrices, and bold lowercase letters are often used for vectors. The names of well-known functions, such as sin \"x\" (the trigonometric function sine) and exp \"x\" (the constant \"e\" raised to the power of \"x\") are written in lowercase upright letters (and often, as shown here, without parentheses around the argument).\nCertain important constructs are sometimes referred to by blackboard bold letters. For example, some authors denote the set of natural numbers by formula_3. Other authors prefer to use bold Latin for these symbols. (In context of math, font variations such as bold/non-bold may encode an arbitrary relation between symbols; using specialized symbols for formula_3 etc. allows the author more freedom of expressing such relations.)"], "wikipedia-1042164": ["BULLET::::- proper: If, for some notion of substructure, objects are substructures of themselves (that is, the relationship is reflexive), then the qualification \"proper\" requires the objects to be different. For example, a \"proper\" subset of a set \"S\" is a subset of \"S\" that is different from \"S\", and a \"proper\" divisor of a number \"n\" is a divisor of \"n\" that is different from \"n\". This overloaded word is also non-jargon for a proper morphism.\nBULLET::::- regular : A function is called \"regular\" if it satisfies satisfactory continuity and differentiability properties, which are often context-dependent. These properties might include possessing a specified number of derivatives, with the function and its derivatives exhibiting some \"nice\" property (see \"nice\" above), such as H\u00f6lder continuity. Informally, this term is sometimes used synonymously with \"smooth\", below. These imprecise uses of the word \"regular\" are not to be confused with the notion of a regular topological space, which is rigorously defined.\nBULLET::::- resp.: (Respectively) A convention to shorten parallel expositions. \"A (resp. B) [has some relationship to] X (resp. Y)\" means that A [has some relationship to] X and also that B [has (the same) relationship to] Y. For example, squares (resp. triangles) have 4 sides (resp. 3 sides); or compact (resp. Lindel\u00f6f) spaces are ones where every open cover has a finite (resp. countable) open subcover.\nBULLET::::- sharp: Often, a mathematical theorem will establish constraints on the behavior of some object; for example, a function will be shown to have an upper or lower bound. The constraint is \"sharp\" (sometimes \"optimal\") if it cannot be made more restrictive without failing in some cases. For example, for arbitrary nonnegative real numbers \"x\", the exponential function \"e\", where \"e\" = 2.7182818..., gives an upper bound on the values of the quadratic function \"x\". This is not sharp; the gap between the functions is everywhere at least 1. Among the exponential functions of the form \u03b1, setting \u03b1 = \"e\" = 2.0870652... results in a sharp upper bound; the slightly smaller choice \u03b1 = 2 fails to produce an upper bound, since then \u03b1 = 8  3. In applied fields the word \"tight\" is often used with the same meaning.\nBULLET::::- smooth: \"Smoothness\" is a concept which mathematics has endowed with many meanings, from simple differentiability to infinite differentiability to analyticity, and still others which are more complicated. Each such usage attempts to invoke the physically intuitive notion of smoothness.\nBULLET::::- strong, stronger: A theorem is said to be \"strong\" if it deduces restrictive results from general hypotheses. One celebrated example is Donaldson's theorem, which puts tight restraints on what would otherwise appear to be a large class of manifolds. This (informal) usage reflects the opinion of the mathematical community: not only should such a theorem be strong in the descriptive sense (below) but it should also be definitive in its area. A theorem, result, or condition is further called \"stronger\" than another one if a proof of the second can be easily obtained from the first but not conversely. An example is the sequence of theorems: Fermat's little theorem, Euler's theorem, Lagrange's theorem, each of which is stronger than the last; another is that a sharp upper bound (see \"sharp\" above) is a stronger result than a non-sharp one. Finally, the adjective \"strong\" or the adverb \"strongly\" may be added to a mathematical notion to indicate a related stronger notion; for example, a strong antichain is an antichain satisfying certain additional conditions, and likewise a strongly regular graph is a regular graph meeting stronger conditions. When used in this way, the stronger notion (such as \"strong antichain\") is a technical term with a precisely defined meaning; the nature of the extra conditions cannot be derived from the definition of the weaker notion (such as \"antichain\").\nBULLET::::- sufficiently large, suitably small, sufficiently close: In the context of limits, these terms refer to some (unspecified, even unknown) point at which a phenomenon prevails as the limit is approached. A statement such as that predicate \"P\" holds for sufficiently large values, can be expressed in more formal notation by \u2203\"x\" : \u2200\"y\" \u2265 \"x\" : \"P\"(\"y\"). See also \"eventually\".\nBULLET::::- upstairs, downstairs: A descriptive term referring to notation in which two objects are written one above the other; the upper one is \"upstairs\" and the lower, \"downstairs\". For example, in a fiber bundle, the total space is often said to be \"upstairs\", with the base space \"downstairs\". In a fraction, the numerator is occasionally referred to as \"upstairs\" and the denominator \"downstairs\", as in \"bringing a term upstairs\".\nBULLET::::- up to, modulo, mod out by: An extension to mathematical discourse of the notions of modular arithmetic. A statement is true \"up to\" a condition if the establishment of that condition is the only impediment to the truth of the statement. Also used when working with members of equivalence classes, esp. in category theory, where the equivalence relation is (categorical) isomorphism; for example, \"The tensor product in a weak monoidal category is associative and unital up to a natural isomorphism.\"\nBULLET::::- vanish: To assume the value 0. For example, \"The function sin(\"x\") vanishes for those values of \"x\" that are integer multiples of \u03c0.\" This can also apply to limits: see Vanish at infinity.\nBULLET::::- weak, weaker: The converse of strong.\nBULLET::::- well-defined: Accurately and precisely described or specified. For example, sometimes a definition relies on a choice of some object; the result of the definition must then be independent of this choice."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The notation can also include symbols for parts of the conventional discourse between mathematicians, when viewing mathematics as a language.\nModern mathematics needs to be precise, because ambiguous notations do not allow formal proofs. Suppose that we have statements, denoted by some formal sequence of symbols, about some objects (for example, numbers, shapes, patterns). Until the statements can be shown to be valid, their meaning is not yet resolved. While reasoning, we might let the symbols refer to those denoted objects, perhaps in a model. The semantics of that object has a heuristic side and a deductive side. In either case, we might want to know the properties of that object, which we might then list in an intensional definition.\nThose properties might then be expressed by some well-known and agreed-upon symbols from a table of mathematical symbols.

Mathematical notation comprises the symbols used to write mathematical equations and formulas. Notation generally implies a set of well-defined representations of quantities and symbols operators. The history includes Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals, letters from the Roman, Greek, Hebrew, and German alphabets, and a host of symbols invented by mathematicians over the past several centuries.\nThe development of mathematical notation can be divided in stages. The \"rhetorical\" stage is where calculations are performed by words and no symbols are used. The \"syncopated\" stage is where frequently used operations and quantities are represented by symbolic syntactical abbreviations. From ancient times through the post-classical age, bursts of mathematical creativity were often followed by centuries of stagnation. As the early modern age opened and the worldwide spread of knowledge began, written examples of mathematical developments came to light. The \"symbolic\" stage is where comprehensive systems of notation supersede rhetoric. Beginning in Italy in the 16th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an increasing pace that continues through the present day. This symbolic system was in use by medieval Indian mathematicians and in Europe since the middle of the 17th century, and has continued to develop in the contemporary era.\nThe area of study known as the history of mathematics is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in mathematics and, the focus here, the investigation into the mathematical methods and notation of the past."], "wikipedia-147460": ["In mathematics, and in other disciplines involving formal languages, including mathematical logic and computer science, a free variable is a notation (symbol) that specifies places in an expression where substitution may take place and is not a parameter of this or any container expression.

The idea is related to a placeholder (a symbol that will later be replaced by some literal string), or a wildcard character that stands for an unspecified symbol.\nIn computer programming, the term free variable refers to variables used in a function that are neither local variables nor parameters of that function. The term non-local variable is often a synonym in this context.\nA bound variable is a variable that was previously \"free\", but has been \"bound\" to a specific value or set of values called domain of discourse or universe.

This language consists of a substrate of some natural language (for example English) using technical terms and grammatical conventions that are peculiar to mathematical discourse (see Mathematical jargon), supplemented by a highly specialized symbolic notation for mathematical formulas.\nLike natural languages in general, discourse using the language of mathematics can employ a scala of registers. Research articles in academic journals are sources for detailed theoretical discussions about ideas concerning mathematics and its implications for society.\nSection::::What is a language?\nHere are some definitions of language:\nBULLET::::- \"a systematic means of communicating by the use of sounds or conventional symbols\"\nBULLET::::- \"a system of words used in a particular discipline\"\nBULLET::::- \"a system of abstract codes which represent antecedent events and concepts\"\nBULLET::::- \"the code we all use to express ourselves and communicate to others\" - Speech & Language Therapy Glossary of Terms\nBULLET::::- \"a set (finite or infinite) of sentences, each finite in length and constructed out of a finite set of elements\" - Noam Chomsky.\nThese definitions describe language in terms of the following components:\nBULLET::::- A vocabulary of symbols or words\nBULLET::::- A grammar consisting of rules of how these symbols may be used\nBULLET::::- A 'syntax' or propositional structure, which places the symbols in linear structures.\nBULLET::::- A 'Discourse' or 'narrative,' consisting of strings of syntactic propositions\nBULLET::::- A community of people who use and understand these symbols\nBULLET::::- A range of meanings that can be communicated with these symbols\nEach of these components is also found in the language of mathematics.\nSection::::The vocabulary of mathematics.\nMathematical notation has assimilated symbols from many different alphabets and typefaces. It also includes symbols that are specific to mathematics, such as\nMathematical notation is central to the power of modern mathematics. Though the algebra of Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b did not use such symbols, it solved equations using many more rules than are used today with symbolic notation, and had great difficulty working with multiple variables (which using symbolic notation can simply be called formula_2, etc.). Sometimes formulas cannot be understood without a written or spoken explanation, but often they are sufficient by themselves, and sometimes they are difficult to read aloud or information is lost in the translation to words, as when several parenthetical factors are involved or when a complex structure like a matrix is manipulated.\nLike any other profession, mathematics also has its own brand of technical terminology. In some cases, a word in general usage has a different and specific meaning within mathematics\u2014examples are group, ring, field, category, term, and factor. For more examples, see .\nIn other cases, specialist terms have been created which do not exist outside of mathematics\u2014examples are tensor, fractal, functor. Mathematical statements have their own moderately complex taxonomy, being divided into axioms, conjectures, theorems, lemmas and corollaries. And there are stock phrases in mathematics, used with specific meanings, such as \"\", \"\" and \"\"without loss of generality\"\". Such phrases are known as mathematical jargon.\nThe vocabulary of mathematics also has visual elements. Diagrams are used informally on blackboards, as well as more formally in published work. When used appropriately, diagrams display schematic information more easily. Diagrams also help visually and aid intuitive calculations. Sometimes, as in a visual proof, a diagram even serves as complete justification for a proposition. A system of diagram conventions may evolve into a mathematical notation \u2013 for example, the Penrose graphical notation for tensor products.\nSection::::The grammar of mathematics.\nThe mathematical notation used for formulas has its own grammar, not dependent on a specific natural language, but shared internationally by mathematicians regardless of their mother tongues. This includes the conventions that the formulas are written predominantly left to right, even when the writing system of the substrate language is right-to-left, and that the Latin alphabet is commonly used for simple variables and parameters. A formula such as\nis understood by Chinese and Syrian mathematicians alike.\nSuch mathematical formulas can be a part of speech in a natural-language phrase, or even assume the role of a full-fledged sentence. For example, the formula above, an inequation, can be considered a sentence or an independent clause in which the greater than or equal to symbol has the role of a symbolic verb. In careful speech, this can be made clear by pronouncing \"\u2265\" as \"is greater than or equal to\", but in an informal context mathematicians may shorten this to \"greater or equal\" and yet handle this grammatically like a verb. A good example is the book title \"Why does ?\"; here, the equals sign has the role of an infinitive.\nMathematical formulas can be \"vocalized\" (spoken aloud). The vocalization system for formulas has to be learned, and is dependent on the underlying natural language. For example, when using English, the expression \"\"\u0192\"(\"x\")\" is conventionally pronounced \"eff of eks\", where the insertion of the preposition \"of\" is not suggested by the notation per se. The expression \"formula_4\", on the other hand, is commonly vocalized like \"dee-why-dee-eks\", with complete omission of the fraction bar, in other contexts often pronounced \"over\". The book title \"Why does ?\" is said aloud as \"Why does ee equal em see-squared?\".\nCharacteristic for mathematical discourse \u2013 both formal and informal \u2013 is the use of the inclusive first person plural \"we\" to mean: \"the audience (or reader) together with the speaker (or author)\".\nSection::::The grammar of mathematics.:Typographical conventions.\nAs is the case for spoken mathematical language, in written or printed mathematical discourse, mathematical expressions containing a symbolic verb, like formula_5, are generally treated as clauses (dependent or independent) in sentences or as complete sentences and are punctuated as such by mathematicians and theoretical physicists. In particular, this is true for \"both\" inline and displayed expressions. In contrast, writers in other natural sciences disciplines may try to avoid using equations within sentences and may treat displayed expressions in the same way as figures or schemes.\nAs an example, a mathematician might write: \nIn this statement, \"formula_6\" (in which formula_6 is read as \"ay en\" or perhaps, more formally, as \"the sequence ay en\") and \"formula_7\" are treated as nouns, while \"formula_8\" (read: the limit of formula_18 as \"n\" tends to infinity equals 'big A'), \"formula_9\", and \"formula_20\" are read as independent clauses, and \"formula_12\" is read as \"the equation formula_22 equals formula_18 plus formula_24\". Moreover, the sentence ends after the displayed equation, as indicated by the period after \"formula_20\". In terms of typesetting conventions, broadly speaking, standard mathematical functions such as and operations such as as well as punctuation symbols including the various brackets are set in while Latin alphabet variables are set in . Matrices, vectors, and other objects made up of components are set in . (There is some disagreement as to whether the standard constants (e.g., , \u03c0, i = (\u20131)) or the \"d\" in should be italicized. Upper case Greek letters are almost always set in roman, while lower case ones are often italicized.) There are also a number of conventions for the part of the alphabet from which variable names are chosen. For example, , , , , , are usually reserved for integers, and are often used for complex numbers, while , , , \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are used for real numbers. The letters , , are frequently used for unknowns to be found or as arguments of a function, while , , are used for coefficients and , , are mostly used as names of functions. These conventions are not hard rules. Instead these suggestions are met to enhance readability and to provide an intuition for of what kind a given object is, so that one has neither to remember, nor to check the introduction of the mathematical object.\nDefinitions are signaled by words like \"we call\", \"we say\", or \"we mean\" or by statements like \"An [\"object\"] is [\"word to be defined\"] if [\"condition\"]\" (for example, \"A set is closed if it contains all of its limit points.\"). As a special convention, the word \"if\" in such a definition should be interpreted as \"if and only if\".\nTheorems have generally a title or label in bold type, and possibly identify the originator (for example, \"\"). This is immediately followed by the statement of the theorem, usually set in italics. The proof of a theorem is usually clearly delimited, starting with the word \"Proof\" while the end of the proof is indicated by a halmos (\"\u220e\") or another symbol, or by the letters Q.E.D..\nSection::::The language community of mathematics.\nMathematics is used by mathematicians, who form a global community composed of speakers of many languages. It is also used by students of mathematics. As mathematics is a part of primary education in almost all countries, almost all educated people have some exposure to pure mathematics.

Therefore, many notations in mathematics are qualified as abuse of notation in some context and are formally correct in other contexts; as many notations were introduced a long time before any formalization of the theory in which they are used, the qualification of abuse of notation is strongly time dependent.

The formalism of how indices are used varies according to the subject. In particular, there are different methods for referring to the elements of a list, a vector, or a matrix, depending on whether one is writing a formal mathematical paper for publication, or when one is writing a computer program.\n\nIt is frequently helpful in mathematics to refer to the elements of an array using subscripts. The subscripts can be integers or variables. The array takes the form of tensors in general, since these can be treated as multi-dimensional arrays. Special (and more familiar) cases are vectors (1d arrays) and matrices (2d arrays).\n\nMore than one index is used to describe arrays of numbers, in two or more dimensions, such as the elements of a matrix, (see also image to right);\nThe entry of a matrix A is written using two indices, say \"i\" and \"j\", with or without commas to separate the indices: \"a\" or \"a\", where the first subscript is the row number and the second is the column number.\n\nIn several programming languages, index notation is a way of addressing elements of an array. This method is used since it is closest to how it is implemented in assembly language whereby the address of the first element is used as a base, and a multiple (the index) of the element size is used to address inside the array.\n\nThings become more interesting when we consider arrays with more than one index, for example, a two-dimensional table. We have three possibilities:\nBULLET::::- make the two-dimensional array one-dimensional by computing a single index from the two\nBULLET::::- consider a one-dimensional array where each element is another one-dimensional array, i.e. an array of arrays\nBULLET::::- use additional storage to hold the array of addresses of each row of the original array, and store the rows of the original array as separate one-dimensional arrays\n\nIn C, all three methods can be used. When the first method is used, the programmer decides how the elements of the array are laid out in the computer's memory, and provides the formulas to compute the location of each element. The second method is used when the number of elements in each row is the same and known at the time the program is written. The programmer declares the array to have, say, three columns by writing e.g. . One then refers to a particular element of the array by writing . The compiler computes the total number of memory cells occupied by each row, uses the first index to find the address of the desired row, and then uses the second index to find the address of the desired element in the row. When the third method is used, the programmer declares the table to be an array of pointers, like in . When the programmer subsequently specifies a particular element , the compiler generates instructions to look up the address of the row specified by the first index, and use this address as the base when computing the address of the element specified by the second index."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.\nA problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying their computational complexity, i.e., the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other measures of complexity are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do. The P versus NP problem, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, is dedicated to the field of computational complexity.\nClosely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources.

Dijkstra's algorithm initially marks the distance (from the starting point) to every other intersection on the map with \"infinity\". This is done not to imply that there is an infinite distance, but to note that those intersections have not been visited yet. Some variants of this method leave the intersections' distances \"unlabeled\". Now select the \"current intersection\" at each iteration. For the first iteration, the current intersection will be the starting point, and the distance to it (the intersection's label) will be \"zero\". For subsequent iterations (after the first), the current intersection will be a \"closest unvisited intersection\" to the starting point (this will be easy to find).\nFrom the current intersection, \"update\" the distance to every unvisited intersection that is directly connected to it. This is done by determining the \"sum\" of the distance between an unvisited intersection and the value of the current intersection and then relabeling the unvisited intersection with this value (the sum) if it is less than the unvisited intersection's current value. In effect, the intersection is relabeled if the path to it through the current intersection is shorter than the previously known paths. To facilitate shortest path identification, in pencil, mark the road with an arrow pointing to the relabeled intersection if you label/relabel it, and erase all others pointing to it. After you have updated the distances to each neighboring intersection, mark the current intersection as \"visited\" and select an unvisited intersection with minimal distance (from the starting point) \u2013 or the lowest label\u2014as the current intersection. Intersections marked as visited are labeled with the shortest path from the starting point to it and will not be revisited or returned to.\nContinue this process of updating the neighboring intersections with the shortest distances, marking the current intersection as visited, and moving onto a closest unvisited intersection until you have marked the destination as visited. Once you have marked the destination as visited (as is the case with any visited intersection), you have determined the shortest path to it from the starting point and can \"trace your way back following the arrows in reverse\". In the algorithm's implementations, this is usually done (after the algorithm has reached the destination node) by following the nodes' parents from the destination node up to the starting node; that's why we also keep track of each node's parent."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Typically, programmers are interested in algorithms that scale efficiently to large input sizes, and merge sort is preferred over bubble sort for lists of length encountered in most data-intensive programs.\nSome examples of Big O notation applied to algorithms' asymptotic time complexity include:"], "wikipedia-2675766": ["BULLET::::- Big O notation, indicating the order of growth of some quantity as a function of \"n\" or the limiting behavior of a function, e.g. in Computational complexity theory"], "wikipedia-15560095": ["The maximal number of \"top-nodes\" for a given reservation is 2.log n.\nBULLET::::- to check if an amount of resource is available during a specific period of time : O(log n)\nBULLET::::- to reserve an amount of resource for a specific period of time : O(log n)\nBULLET::::- to delete a previous reservation : O(log n)\nBULLET::::- to move the calendar forward : O(log n + M.log n)\nwhere M is the number of reservations that are active during the added calendar periods."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-44578": 2, "wikipedia-22284600": 1, "wikipedia-2811119": 1, "wikipedia-27701374": 1, "wikipedia-4067031": 1, "wikipedia-28442": 2, "wikipedia-145128": 2, "wikipedia-2675766": 1, "wikipedia-561585": 1, "wikipedia-15560095": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-44578": 3, "wikipedia-22284600": 1, "wikipedia-2811119": 1, "wikipedia-27701374": 1, "wikipedia-4067031": 1, "wikipedia-28442": 3, "wikipedia-145128": 3, "wikipedia-2675766": 2, "wikipedia-561585": 1, "wikipedia-15560095": 2}}}

The boundary circle of a disk splits the set of roots of \"p\"(\"x\") in two parts, hence the name of the method. To a given disk one computes approximate factors following the analytical theory and refines them using Newton's method.

For simplicity let us focus on Michigan-style architecture with supervised learning. See the illustrations on the right laying out the sequential steps involved in this type of generic LCS.\n\nOne of the most critical and often time consuming elements of an LCS is the matching process. The first step in an LCS learning cycle takes a single training instance from the environment and passes it to [P] where matching takes place. In step two, every rule in [P] is now compared to the training instance to see which rules match (i.e. are contextually relevant to the current instance). In step three, any matching rules are moved to a \"match set\" [M]. A rule matches a training instance if all feature values specified in the rule condition are equivalent to the corresponding feature value in the training instance. For example, assuming the training instance is (001001 ~ 0), these rules would match: (###0## ~ 0), (00###1 ~ 0), (#01001 ~ 1), but these rules would not (1##### ~ 0), (000##1 ~ 0), (#0#1#0 ~ 1). Notice that in matching, the endpoint/action specified by the rule is not taken into consideration. As a result, the match set may contain classifiers that propose conflicting actions. In the fourth step, since we are performing supervised learning, [M] is divided into a correct set [C] and an incorrect set [I]. A matching rule goes into the correct set if it proposes the correct action (based on the known action of the training instance), otherwise it goes into [I]. In reinforcement learning LCS, an action set [A] would be formed here instead, since the correct action is not known.\n\nAt this point in the learning cycle, if no classifiers made it into either [M] or [C] (as would be the case when the population starts off empty), the covering mechanism is applied (fifth step). Covering is a form of \"online smart population initialization\". Covering randomly generates a rule that matches the current training instance (and in the case of supervised learning, that rule is also generated with the correct action. Assuming the training instance is (001001 ~ 0), covering might generate any of the following rules: (#0#0## ~ 0), (001001 ~ 0), (#010## ~ 0).

It can be an offline, finite training dataset (characteristic of a data mining, classification, or regression problem), or an online sequential stream of live training instances. Each training instance is assumed to include some number of \"features\" (also referred to as \"attributes\", or \"independent variables\"), and a single \"endpoint\" of interest (also referred to as the class, \"action\", \"phenotype\", \"prediction\", or \"dependent variable\"). Part of LCS learning can involve feature selection, therefore not all of the features in the training data need be informative. The set of feature values of an instance is commonly referred to as the \"state\". For simplicity let's assume an example problem domain with Boolean/binary features and a Boolean/binary class. For Michigan-style systems, one instance from the environment is trained on each learning cycle (i.e. incremental learning). Pittsburgh-style systems perform batch learning, where rule-sets are evaluated each iteration over much or all of the training data.\nSection::::Methodology.:Elements of a generic LCS algorithm.:Rule/classifier/population.\nA rule is a context dependent relationship between state values and some prediction. Rules typically take the form of an {IF:THEN} expression, (e.g. {\"IF 'condition' THEN 'action'},\" or as a more specific example, \"{IF 'red' AND 'octagon' THEN 'stop-sign'}\"). A critical concept in LCS and rule-based machine learning alike, is that an individual rule is not in itself a model, since the rule is only applicable when its condition is satisfied. Think of a rule as a \"local-model\" of the solution space.\nRules can be represented in many different ways to handle different data types (e.g. binary, discrete-valued, ordinal, continuous-valued). Given binary data LCS traditionally applies a ternary rule representation (i.e. rules can include either a 0, 1, or '#' for each feature in the data). The 'don't care' symbol (i.e. '#') serves as a wild card within a rule's condition allowing rules, and the system as a whole to generalize relationships between features and the target endpoint to be predicted. Consider the following rule (#1###0 ~ 1) (i.e. condition ~ action). This rule can be interpreted as: IF the second feature = 1 AND the sixth feature = 0 THEN the class prediction = 1. We would say that the second and sixth features were specified in this rule, while the others were generalized. This rule, and the corresponding prediction are only applicable to an instance when the condition of the rule is satisfied by the instance. This is more commonly referred to as matching. In Michigan-style LCS, each rule has its own fitness, as well as a number of other rule-parameters associated with it that can describe the number of copies of that rule that exist (i.e. the \"numerosity\"), the age of the rule, its accuracy, or the accuracy of its reward predictions, and other descriptive or experiential statistics. A rule along with its parameters is often referred to as a \"classifier\". In Michigan-style systems, classifiers are contained within a \"population\" [P] that has a user defined maximum number of classifiers. Unlike most stochastic search algorithms (e.g. evolutionary algorithms), LCS populations start out empty (i.e. there is no need to randomly initialize a rule population). Classifiers will instead be initially introduced to the population with a covering mechanism.\nIn any LCS, the trained model is a set of rules/classifiers, rather than any single rule/classifier. In Michigan-style LCS, the entire trained (and optionally, compacted) classifier population forms the prediction model.\nSection::::Methodology.:Elements of a generic LCS algorithm.:Matching.\nOne of the most critical and often time consuming elements of an LCS is the matching process. The first step in an LCS learning cycle takes a single training instance from the environment and passes it to [P] where matching takes place. In step two, every rule in [P] is now compared to the training instance to see which rules match (i.e. are contextually relevant to the current instance). In step three, any matching rules are moved to a \"match set\" [M]. A rule matches a training instance if all feature values specified in the rule condition are equivalent to the corresponding feature value in the training instance. For example, assuming the training instance is (001001 ~ 0), these rules would match: (###0## ~ 0), (00###1 ~ 0), (#01001 ~ 1), but these rules would not (1##### ~ 0), (000##1 ~ 0), (#0#1#0 ~ 1). Notice that in matching, the endpoint/action specified by the rule is not taken into consideration. As a result, the match set may contain classifiers that propose conflicting actions. In the fourth step, since we are performing supervised learning, [M] is divided into a correct set [C] and an incorrect set [I]. A matching rule goes into the correct set if it proposes the correct action (based on the known action of the training instance), otherwise it goes into [I]. In reinforcement learning LCS, an action set [A] would be formed here instead, since the correct action is not known.\nSection::::Methodology.:Elements of a generic LCS algorithm.:Covering.\nAt this point in the learning cycle, if no classifiers made it into either [M] or [C] (as would be the case when the population starts off empty), the covering mechanism is applied (fifth step). Covering is a form of \"online smart population initialization\". Covering randomly generates a rule that matches the current training instance (and in the case of supervised learning, that rule is also generated with the correct action. Assuming the training instance is (001001 ~ 0), covering might generate any of the following rules: (#0#0## ~ 0), (001001 ~ 0), (#010## ~ 0). Covering not only ensures that each learning cycle there is at least one correct, matching rule in [C], but that any rule initialized into the population will match at least one training instance. This prevents LCS from exploring the search space of rules that do not match any training instances.\nSection::::Methodology.:Elements of a generic LCS algorithm.:Parameter updates/credit assignment/learning.\nIn the sixth step, the rule parameters of any rule in [M] are updated to reflect the new experience gained from the current training instance. Depending on the LCS algorithm, a number of updates can take place at this step. For supervised learning, we can simply update the accuracy/error of a rule. Rule accuracy/error is different than model accuracy/error, since it is not calculated over the entire training data, but only over all instances that it matched.

The approach can be applied to many types of problems, and recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science.\nMost computer programming languages support recursion by allowing a function to call itself from within its own code. Some functional programming languages do not define any looping constructs but rely solely on recursion to repeatedly call code. Computability theory proves that these recursive-only languages are Turing complete; they are as computationally powerful as Turing complete imperative languages, meaning they can solve the same kinds of problems as imperative languages even without iterative control structures such as and .\nSection::::Recursive functions and algorithms.\nA common computer programming tactic is to divide a problem into sub-problems of the same type as the original, solve those sub-problems, and combine the results. This is often referred to as the divide-and-conquer method; when combined with a lookup table that stores the results of solving sub-problems (to avoid solving them repeatedly and incurring extra computation time), it can be referred to as dynamic programming or memoization.\nA recursive function definition has one or more \"base cases\", meaning input(s) for which the function produces a result trivially (without recurring), and one or more \"recursive cases\", meaning input(s) for which the program recurs (calls itself). For example, the factorial function can be defined recursively by the equations and, for all , . Neither equation by itself constitutes a complete definition; the first is the base case, and the second is the recursive case. Because the base case breaks the chain of recursion, it is sometimes also called the \"terminating case\".\nThe job of the recursive cases can be seen as breaking down complex inputs into simpler ones. In a properly designed recursive function, with each recursive call, the input problem must be simplified in such a way that eventually the base case must be reached. (Functions that are not intended to terminate under normal circumstances\u2014for example, some system and server processes\u2014are an exception to this.) Neglecting to write a base case, or testing for it incorrectly, can cause an infinite loop.\nFor some functions (such as one that computes the series for ) there is not an obvious base case implied by the input data; for these one may add a parameter (such as the number of terms to be added, in our series example) to provide a 'stopping criterion' that establishes the base case. Such an example is more naturally treated by co-recursion, where successive terms in the output are the partial sums; this can be converted to a recursion by using the indexing parameter to say \"compute the \"n\"th term (\"n\"th partial sum)\"."], "wikipedia-12555671": ["In numerical mathematics, relaxation methods are iterative methods for solving systems of equations, including nonlinear systems.\nRelaxation methods were developed for solving large sparse linear systems, which arose as finite-difference discretizations of differential equations.

They have also been developed for solving nonlinear systems of equations.\nRelaxation methods are important especially in the solution of linear systems used to model elliptic partial differential equations, such as Laplace's equation and its generalization, Poisson's equation. These equations describe boundary-value problems, in which the solution-function's values are specified on boundary of a domain; the problem is to compute a solution also on its interior.

In supervised learning, an algorithm is given samples that are labeled in some useful way. For example, the samples might be descriptions of mushrooms, and the labels could be whether or not the mushrooms are edible. The algorithm takes these previously labeled samples and uses them to induce a classifier. This classifier is a function that assigns labels to samples, including samples that have not been seen previously by the algorithm. The goal of the supervised learning algorithm is to optimise some measure of performance such as minimising the number of mistakes made on new samples.\nIn addition to performance bounds, computational learning theory studies the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results:\n- Positive resultsShowing that a certain class of functions is learnable in polynomial time.\n- Negative resultsShowing that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\nNegative results often rely on commonly believed, but yet unproven assumptions, such as:\n- Computational complexity \u2013 P \u2260 NP (the P versus NP problem);\n- Cryptographic \u2013 One-way functions exist.\nThere are several different approaches to computational learning theory. These differences are based on making assumptions about the inference principles used to generalize from limited data. This includes different definitions of probability (see frequency probability, Bayesian probability) and different assumptions on the generation of samples. The different approaches include:\n- Exact learning, proposed by Dana Angluin;\n- Probably approximately correct learning (PAC learning), proposed by Leslie Valiant;\n- VC theory, proposed by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis;\n- Bayesian inference;\n- Algorithmic learning theory, from the work of E. Mark Gold;\n- Online machine learning, from the work of Nick Littlestone.\nComputational learning theory has led to several practical algorithms. For example, PAC theory inspired boosting, VC theory led to support vector machines, and Bayesian inference led to belief networks (by Judea Pearl)."], "wikipedia-6901703": ["Algorithm characterizations are attempts to formalize the word algorithm. Algorithm does not have a generally accepted formal definition. Researchers are actively working on this problem. This article will present some of the \"characterizations\" of the notion of \"algorithm\" in more detail.\n\nOver the last 200 years the definition of algorithm has become more complicated and detailed as researchers have tried to pin down the term. Indeed, there may be more than one type of \"algorithm\". But most agree that algorithm has something to do with defining generalized processes for the creation of \"output\" integers from other \"input\" integers \u2013 \"input parameters\" arbitrary and infinite in extent, or limited in extent but still variable\u2014by the manipulation of distinguishable symbols (counting numbers) with finite collections of rules that a person can perform with paper and pencil.\n\nThe most common number-manipulation schemes\u2014both in formal mathematics and in routine life\u2014are: (1) the recursive functions calculated by a person with paper and pencil, and (2) the Turing machine or its Turing equivalents\u2014the primitive register machine or \"counter machine\" model, the Random Access Machine model (RAM), the Random access stored program machine model (RASP) and its functional equivalent \"the computer\".\n\nThe proofs that every \"recursive function\" we can \"calculate by hand\" we can \"compute by machine\" and vice versa\u2014note the usage of the words \"calculate\" versus \"compute\"\u2014is remarkable. But this equivalence together with the \"thesis\" (unproven assertion) that this includes \"every\" calculation/computation indicates why so much emphasis has been placed upon the use of Turing-equivalent machines in the definition of specific algorithms, and why the definition of \"algorithm\" itself often refers back to \"the Turing machine\". This is discussed in more detail under Stephen Kleene's characterization.\n\nThere is more consensus on the \"characterization\" of the notion of \"simple algorithm\". All algorithms need to be specified in a formal language, and the \"simplicity notion\" arises from the simplicity of the language. The Chomsky (1956) hierarchy is a containment hierarchy of classes of formal grammars that generate formal languages. It is used for classifying of programming languages and abstract machines.\n\nFrom the \"Chomsky hierarchy\" perspective, if the algorithm can be specified on a simpler language (than unrestricted), it can be characterized by this kind of language, else it is a typical \"unrestricted algorithm\"."], "wikipedia-16300571": ["The field of computational creativity concerns itself with theoretical and practical issues in the study of creativity.

Stephen Thaler has suggested a new category he calls \"V-\" or \"Visceral creativity\" wherein significance is invented to raw sensory inputs to a Creativity Machine architecture, with the \"gateway\" nets perturbed to produce alternative interpretations, and downstream nets shifting such interpretations to fit the overarching context. An important variety of such V-creativity is consciousness itself, wherein meaning is reflexively invented to activation turnover within the brain.\n\nBoden also distinguishes between the creativity that arises from an exploration within an established conceptual space, and the creativity that arises from a deliberate transformation or transcendence of this space. She labels the former as \"exploratory creativity\" and the latter as \"transformational creativity\", seeing the latter as a form of creativity far more radical, challenging, and rarer than the former.\n\nThe criterion that creative products should be novel and useful means that creative computational systems are typically structured into two phases, generation and evaluation. In the first phase, novel (to the system itself, thus P-Creative) constructs are generated; unoriginal constructs that are already known to the system are filtered at this stage. This body of potentially creative constructs are then evaluated, to determine which are meaningful and useful and which are not. This two-phase structure conforms to the Geneplore model of Finke, Ward and Smith, which is a psychological model of creative generation based on empirical observation of human creativity.\n\nA great deal, perhaps all, of human creativity can be understood as a novel combination of pre-existing ideas or objects .

In supervised learning, an algorithm is given samples that are labeled in some useful way. For example, the samples might be descriptions of mushrooms, and the labels could be whether or not the mushrooms are edible. The algorithm takes these previously labeled samples and uses them to induce a classifier. This classifier is a function that assigns labels to samples, including samples that have not been seen previously by the algorithm. The goal of the supervised learning algorithm is to optimise some measure of performance such as minimising the number of mistakes made on new samples.\nIn addition to performance bounds, computational learning theory studies the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In\ncomputational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time\ncomplexity results:\nBULLET::::- Positive resultsShowing that a certain class of functions is learnable in polynomial time.\nBULLET::::- Negative resultsShowing that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\nNegative results often rely on commonly believed, but yet unproven assumptions, such as:\nBULLET::::- Computational complexity \u2013 P \u2260 NP (the P versus NP problem);\nBULLET::::- Cryptographic \u2013 One-way functions exist.\nThere are several different approaches to computational learning theory. These differences are based on making assumptions about the\ninference principles used to generalize from limited data. This includes different definitions of probability (see frequency probability, Bayesian probability) and different assumptions on the generation of samples. The different approaches include:\nBULLET::::- Exact learning, proposed by Dana Angluin;\nBULLET::::- Probably approximately correct learning (PAC learning), proposed by Leslie Valiant;\nBULLET::::- VC theory, proposed by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis;\nBULLET::::- Bayesian inference;\nBULLET::::- Algorithmic learning theory, from the work of E. Mark Gold;\nBULLET::::- Online machine learning, from the work of Nick Littlestone.\nComputational learning theory has led to several practical algorithms. For example, PAC theory inspired boosting, VC theory led to support vector machines, and Bayesian inference led to belief networks (by Judea Pearl)."], "wikipedia-6901703": ["Algorithm characterizations are attempts to formalize the word algorithm. Algorithm does not have a generally accepted formal definition. Researchers are actively working on this problem. This article will present some of the \"characterizations\" of the notion of \"algorithm\" in more detail.\n\nSection::::The problem of definition.\nOver the last 200 years the definition of algorithm has become more complicated and detailed as researchers have tried to pin down the term. Indeed, there may be more than one type of \"algorithm\". But most agree that algorithm has something to do with defining generalized processes for the creation of \"output\" integers from other \"input\" integers \u2013 \"input parameters\" arbitrary and infinite in extent, or limited in extent but still variable\u2014by the manipulation of distinguishable symbols (counting numbers) with finite collections of rules that a person can perform with paper and pencil.\n\nThe most common number-manipulation schemes\u2014both in formal mathematics and in routine life\u2014are: (1) the recursive functions calculated by a person with paper and pencil, and (2) the Turing machine or its Turing equivalents\u2014the primitive register machine or \"counter machine\" model, the Random Access Machine model (RAM), the Random access stored program machine model (RASP) and its functional equivalent \"the computer\".\n\nWhen we are doing \"arithmetic\" we are really calculating by the use of \"recursive functions\" in the shorthand algorithms we learned in grade-school, for example, adding and subtracting.\n\nThe proofs that every \"recursive function\" we can \"calculate by hand\" we can \"compute by machine\" and vice versa\u2014note the usage of the words \"calculate\" versus \"compute\"\u2014is remarkable. But this equivalence together with the \"thesis\" (unproven assertion) that this includes \"every\" calculation/computation indicates why so much emphasis has been placed upon the use of Turing-equivalent machines in the definition of specific algorithms, and why the definition of \"algorithm\" itself often refers back to \"the Turing machine\". This is discussed in more detail under Stephen Kleene's characterization.\n\nThe following are summaries of the more famous characterizations (Kleene, Markov, Knuth) together with those that introduce novel elements\u2014elements that further expand the definition or contribute to a more precise definition.\n\nSection::::Chomsky hierarchy.\nThere is more consensus on the \"characterization\" of the notion of \"simple algorithm\".\nAll algorithms need to be specified in a formal language, and the \"simplicity notion\" arises from the simplicity of the language. The Chomsky (1956) hierarchy is a containment hierarchy of classes of formal grammars that generate formal languages. It is used for classifying of programming languages and abstract machines.\nFrom the \"Chomsky hierarchy\" perspective, if the algorithm can be specified on a simpler language (than unrestricted), it can be characterized by this kind of language, else it is a typical \"unrestricted algorithm\".\nExamples: a \"general purpose\" macro language, like M4 is unrestricted (Turing complete), but the C preprocessor macro language is not, so any algorithm expressed in \"C preprocessor\" is a \"simple algorithm\".\nSee also Relationships between complexity classes.\n\nSection::::Features of a Good Algorithm.\nThe following are the features of a good algorithm.\n1. Precision: a good algorithm must have a certain outlined steps. The steps should be exact enough, and not varying.\n2. Uniqueness: each step taken in the algorithm should give a definite result as stated by the writer of the algorithm. The results should not fluctuate by any means.\n3. Feasibility: the algorithm should be possible and practicable in real life. It should not be abstract or imaginary.\n4. Input: a good algorithm must be able to accept a set of defined input.\n5. Output: a good algorithm should be able to produce results as output, preferably solutions.\n6. Finiteness: the algorithm should have a stop after a certain number of instructions.\n7. Generality: the algorithm must apply to a set of defined inputs.\n\nSection::::1943, 1952 Stephen Kleene's characterization.\nThis section is longer and more detailed than the others because of its importance to the topic: Kleene was the first to propose that \"all\" calculations/computations\u2014of \"every\" sort, the \"totality\" of\u2014can \"equivalently\" be (i) \"calculated\" by use of five \"primitive recursive operators\" plus one special operator called the mu-operator, or be (ii) \"computed\" by the actions of a Turing machine or an equivalent model.\n\nFurthermore, he opined that either of these would stand as a definition of algorithm.\n\nA reader first confronting the words that follow may well be confused, so a brief explanation is in order. \"Calculation\" means done by hand, \"computation\" means done by Turing machine (or equivalent). (Sometimes an author slips and interchanges the words). A \"function\" can be thought of as an \"input-output box\" into which a person puts natural numbers called \"arguments\" or \"parameters\" (but only the counting numbers including 0\u2014the nonnegative integers) and gets out a single nonnegative integer (conventionally called \"the answer\"). Think of the \"function-box\" as a little man either calculating by hand using \"general recursion\" or computing by Turing machine (or an equivalent machine).\n\n\"Effectively calculable/computable\" is more generic and means \"calculable/computable by \"some\" procedure, method, technique ... whatever...\". \"General recursive\" was Kleene's way of writing what today is called just \"recursion\"; however, \"primitive recursion\"\u2014calculation by use of the five recursive operators\u2014is a lesser form of recursion that lacks access to the sixth, additional, mu-operator that is needed only in rare instances. Thus most of life goes on requiring only the \"primitive recursive functions.\"\n\nSection::::1943, 1952 Stephen Kleene's characterization.:1943 \"Thesis I\", 1952 \"Church's Thesis\".\nIn 1943 Kleene proposed what has come to be known as Church's thesis:\nIn a nutshell: to calculate \"any\" function the only operations a person needs (technically, formally) are the 6 primitive operators of \"general\" recursion (nowadays called the operators of the mu recursive functions).\nKleene's first statement of this was under the section title \"12. Algorithmic theories\". He would later amplify it in his text (1952) as follows:\nThis is not as daunting as it may sound \u2013 \"general\" recursion is just a way of making our everyday arithmetic operations from the five \"operators\" of the primitive recursive functions together with the additional mu-operator as needed. Indeed, Kleene gives 13 examples of primitive recursive functions and Boolos\u2013Burgess\u2013Jeffrey add some more, most of which will be familiar to the reader\u2014e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, exponentiation, the CASE function, concatenation, etc., etc.; for a list see Some common primitive recursive functions.\nWhy general-recursive functions rather than primitive-recursive functions?\nKleene et al. (cf \u00a755 General recursive functions p.\u00a0270 in Kleene 1952) had to add a sixth recursion operator called the minimization-operator (written as \u03bc-operator or mu-operator) because Ackermann (1925) produced a hugely growing function\u2014the Ackermann function\u2014and R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter (1935) produced a general method of creating recursive functions using Cantor's diagonal argument, neither of which could be described by the 5 primitive-recursive-function operators. With respect to the Ackermann function:\nBut the need for the mu-operator is a rarity. As indicated above by Kleene's list of common calculations, a person goes about their life happily computing primitive recursive functions without fear of encountering the monster numbers created by Ackermann's function (e.g. super-exp"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-353748": 2, "wikipedia-402688": 2, "wikipedia-7543": 2, "wikipedia-24095830": 2, "wikipedia-26476831": 1, "wikipedia-387537": 2, "wikipedia-46573763": 1, "wikipedia-6901703": 2, "wikipedia-16300571": 1, "wikipedia-20847621": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-353748": 3, "wikipedia-402688": 3, "wikipedia-7543": 3, "wikipedia-24095830": 3, "wikipedia-26476831": 1, "wikipedia-387537": 3, "wikipedia-46573763": 1, "wikipedia-6901703": 3, "wikipedia-16300571": 2, "wikipedia-20847621": 1}}}

The name \"master theorem\" was popularized by the widely used algorithms textbook \"Introduction to Algorithms\" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. \nNot all recurrence relations can be solved with the use of this theorem; its generalizations include the Akra\u2013Bazzi method.\nSection::::Introduction.\nConsider a problem that can be solved using a recursive algorithm such as the following:\nThe above algorithm divides the problem into a number of subproblems recursively, each subproblem being of size . Its solution tree has a node for each recursive call, with the children of that node being the other calls made from that call. The leaves of the tree are the base cases of the recursion, the subproblems (of size less than \"k\") that do not recurse. The above example would have child nodes at each non-leaf node. Each node does an amount of work that corresponds to the size of the sub problem passed to that instance of the recursive call and given by formula_1. The total amount of work done by the entire algorithm is the sum of the work performed by all the nodes in the tree. \nThe runtime of an algorithm such as the 'p' above on an input of size 'n', usually denoted formula_2, can be expressed by the recurrence relation\nwhere formula_4 is the time to create the subproblems and combine their results in the above procedure. This equation can be successively substituted into itself and expanded to obtain an expression for the total amount of work done.\nThe master theorem allows many recurrence relations of this form to be converted to \u0398-notation directly, without doing an expansion of the recursive relation.\nSection::::Generic form.\nThe master theorem often yields asymptotically tight bounds to some recurrences from divide and conquer algorithms that partition an input into smaller subproblems of equal sizes, solve the subproblems recursively, and then combine the subproblem solutions to give a solution to the original problem. The time for such an algorithm can be expressed by adding the work that they perform at the top level of their recursion (to divide the problems into subproblems and then combine the subproblem solutions) together with the time made in the recursive calls of the algorithm.

That is, an formula_44-only policy specifies, for each possible random event formula_48, a conditional probability distribution for selecting a control action formula_40 given that formula_50. Such a policy makes decisions independent of current queue backlog. Assume there exists an formula_44-only policy formula_52 that satisfies the following:\nThe expectations above are with respect to the random variable formula_14 for slot formula_56 and the random control action formula_16 chosen on slot formula_58 after observing formula_14. Such a policy formula_52 can be shown to exist whenever the desired control problem is feasible and the event space for formula_14 and action space for formula_16 are finite, or when mild closure properties are satisfied.\nLet formula_16 represent the action taken by a C-additive approximation of the drift-plus-penalty algorithm of the previous section, for some non-negative constant C. To simplify terminology, we call this action the \"drift-plus-penalty action\", rather than the \"C-additive approximate drift-plus-penalty action\". Let formula_52 represent the formula_44-only decision:\nAssume the drift-plus-penalty action formula_16 is used on each and every slot. By (Eq. 2), the drift-plus-penalty expression under this formula_16 action satisfies the following for each slot formula_70\nwhere the last inequality follows because action formula_16 comes within an additive constant formula_73 of minimizing the preceding expression over all other actions in the set formula_74 including formula_75 Taking expectations of the above inequality gives:\nNotice that the formula_52 action was never actually implemented.

It can be shown that all virtual queues are mean rate stable, and so all desired constraints are satisfied. The parameter formula_84 affects the size of the queues, which determines the speed at which the time average constraint functions converge to a non-positive number.

Usually, this involves determining a function that relates the length of an algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its time complexity) or the number of storage locations it uses (its space complexity). An algorithm is said to be efficient when this function's values are small, or grow slowly compared to a growth in the size of the input. Different inputs of the same length may cause the algorithm to have different behavior, so best, worst and average case descriptions might all be of practical interest. When not otherwise specified, the function describing the performance of an algorithm is usually an upper bound, determined from the worst case inputs to the algorithm.\nThe term \"analysis of algorithms\" was coined by Donald Knuth. Algorithm analysis is an important part of a broader computational complexity theory, which provides theoretical estimates for the resources needed by any algorithm which solves a given computational problem. These estimates provide an insight into reasonable directions of search for efficient algorithms.\nIn theoretical analysis of algorithms it is common to estimate their complexity in the asymptotic sense, i.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. Big O notation, Big-omega notation and Big-theta notation are used to this end. For instance, binary search is said to run in a number of steps proportional to the logarithm of the length of the sorted list being searched, or in O(log(n)), colloquially \"in logarithmic time\".

Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to differ by at most a constant factor.\nSince an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input. Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases\u2014that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity.
