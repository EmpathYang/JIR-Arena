Due to this complexity, only a few tools are currently available in NDN measurements.

To the best of our knowledge, NDN has a few measurement tools [2, 7, 11, 22] that cover some aspects. Many of them focus on essential properties such as reachability (e.g. ndnping [22]) and the number of available paths (Contrace [also called CCNinfo] [1, 2], ccnx-trace [17], and NDN-trace [7]).

The HopLimit is an Interest field to limit the number of hops the Interest is allowed to be for- warded [21]. To figure out the hop count of a chunk, the client needs to send out an Interest that starts with HopLimit one. If no data is received, it increments the HopLimit value to two and sends out the same interest until a data packet comes back. This approach has two issues. First, the client must send Interests to cover all hops until an Interest reaches the router that contains the data chunk. Most Interests are wasted without any Data chunks returned. These Interests introduce overhead not only into the bandwidth but also the PIT. Second, the measurement with HopLimit will be time- consuming. Interest has to wait until it times out when no Data comes back. No better way to speed up the measurement process without affecting the caching states. To this end, we use measured RTT at the client as the indicator of hops. When RTT does not work, we apply k-means [10] to estimate hop counts for chunks. We simulate the measurement process using ndnSIM [ 12] on Rocketfuel topology 7018 [18]. The real topology contains delays and queuing size for each link, perfect for validating our method. We do not introduce other traffic in the network, as the point of this simulation is not for figuring out the effect of cross traffic. The simulation contains just one client and one server to exchange messages. They are randomly assigned to two nodes on the topol- ogy.

Additionally, when HNPS is applied to prepositional verb structures the result favors the speaker.

Versions intended for cyclists may have a selection of allen (hex) keys, a selection of wrenches, screwdrivers, a spoke key, and a chain-breaker.\nModels like the Wenger SwissGrip, Wenger Pocketgrip, Al Mar 4x4, SOG ToolClip, Snap-on and CRKT Zilla-Tool are similar in style.\nIn 1983 Tim Leatherman sold his first \"Pocket Survival Tool\", larger and more robust than a pocket-knife-based tool, and incorporating a set of needle-nosed pliers in a balisong-style mechanism.

Cyclists may carry a folding tool with multiple screwdriver bits or wrenches to allow adjustment of bicycle fasteners during a ride, or for repairing a broken chain. For sport fishermen, a specialized multitool may combine common functions such as cutting fishing line, crimping weights, removing hooks or opening split rings.

We are more interested in the correctness of our method when encountering cross traffic, as it is more common. To introduce cross traffic, we attach the traffic generator at router eight and three in the linear topology. Cross traffic could happen at any router, but we believe putting traffic on either the server-side and the client-side could help us understand its effect separately. In our simulation, we only turn on one cross traffic at a time. To let cache replacement happen more often, we set the CS size to 100. The traffic generator produces sufficient traffic to overload the router. In our simulation, most mechanisms are not sensitive to cross traffic. They may leave more data chunks at the server-side, and thus they have taller interquartile range, but that does not affect the correctness of detection. The only exception is LCD. However, we can still use the method to identify the LCD mechanism. Figure 4b demonstrates that LCD cannot move forward to lower hops after hop nine (client node is the first hop) in the presence of cross traffic at router eight. LCD initializes the forwarding tag to one when a cached chunk is pulled out. If the Data chunk is evicted, the router is unable to attach such a tag, and the next-hop cannot receive a chunk that contains a caching signal. When the cross traffic happens at router three, the plot becomes a Violin shape when chunks reach the third router (Figure 4a). We can see that samples are not stuck at hop four, but round 8, 9, and 10 contain samples with deviations. In this case, the competition happens close to the client. The delay between the client and the router is small, and thus duplicate Interests get a chance to reach the router before eviction happens. In contrast, the delay between the client and the router eight is much larger. When Interests arrive, cross traffic has evicted all the chunks in the CS."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

A 2014 study of end stage cancer patients found that non-Latino white patients were significantly more likely to have a DNR order (45%) than black (25%) and Latino (20%) patients. The correlation between preferences against life-prolonging care and the increased likelihood of advance care planning is consistent across ethnic groups.\n\nEthical dilemmas occur when a patient with a DNR attempts suicide and the necessary treatment involves ventilation or CPR. In these cases it has been argued that the principle of beneficence takes precedence over patient autonomy and the DNR can be revoked by the physician. Another dilemma occurs when a medical error happens to a patient with a DNR. If the error is reversible only with CPR or ventilation there is no consensus if resuscitation should take place or not.\n\nThere are also ethical concerns around how patients reach the decision to agree to a DNR order.

One might think of these as merely challenges of implementation, but since the process component is integral to the scenario experience, they can also be viewed as weaknesses of the methodology itself. Limited safeguards exist against political derailing, agenda control, myopia and limited imagination when conducting scenario planning exercises within real organizations. But, to varying extents, all forecasting techniques will suffer from such organizational limitations. The benchmark to use is not perfection, especially when faced with high uncertainty and complexity, or even strict adherence to such normative precepts as procedural invariance and logical consistency, but whether the technique performs better than its rivals.

In this paper, we present the first active measurement scheme to detect caching decisions. Our method lets the client send out a small number of Interests to request Data packets under the target name prefix. After repeating the measurements several rounds, the client can collect necessary data chunk information to produce profiles. The profile contains the hop counts distribution and the distribution changes across rounds to identify a caching decision uniquely. We show that our method can estimate the probability value for static probabilistic caching mechanisms, and it is robust to cross traffic. This paper produces profiles for some common available caching decision mechanisms. Other mechanisms, such as the explicit cooperative caching decisions and caching decisions based on betweenness centrality of the caching node, may be deployed in NDN networks.

Every time a router sees a Data packet, it must decide whether to cache the packet, hoping that there will be a later Interest for the same content.\n\nCaching can decrease consumers\u2019 access latency. Caching can also reduce loads on the producers of data. Because duplicate or later requests for the same content can be satisfied from caches in routers, producers are less likely to be overwhelmed when their content is popular.\n\nIn-network caching systems\u2019 performance depends on many factors, such as content popularity, the routing of content request packets, when routers decide to cache, when the cache is full, and, how routers decide which content to replace with new content. Furthermore, experiments suggest that different caching approaches may better serve different applications. A number of different NDN caching policies have been developed (see section 3). Since a caching policy can be applied to a specific name prefix, ISPs have the potential to provide differentiated caching services or other novel caching-related content services.

In such an implementation, every time a cache-line is used, the age of all other cache-lines changes. LRU is actually a family of caching algorithms with members including 2Q by Theodore Johnson and Dennis Shasha, and LRU/K by Pat O'Neil, Betty O'Neil and Gerhard Weikum.\n\nSection::::Policies.:Time aware least recently used (TLRU).\nThe Time aware Least Recently Used (TLRU) is a variant of LRU designed for the situation where the stored contents in cache have a valid life time.

Due to the inherent caching capability of nodes in Information-centric networking ICN, the ICN can be viewed as a loosely connect network of caches, which has unique requirements of Caching policies. Unlike proxy servers, in Information-centric networking the cache is a network level solution. Therefore, it has rapidly changing cache states and higher request arrival rates; moreover, smaller cache sizes further impose different kind of requirements on the content eviction policies.

In LFRU, the cache is divided into two partitions called privileged and unprivileged partitions. The privileged partition can be defined as a protected partition. If content is highly popular, it is pushed into the privileged partition. Replacement of the privileged partition is done as follows: LFRU evicts content from the unprivileged partition, pushes content from privileged partition to unprivileged partition, and finally inserts new content into the privileged partition. In the above procedure the LRU is used for the privileged partition and an approximated LFU (ALFU) scheme is used for the unprivileged partition, hence the abbreviation LFRU. The basic idea is to filter out the locally popular contents with ALFU scheme and push the popular contents to one of the privileged partition."], "wikipedia-8910427": ["Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) is a page replacement algorithm with better performance than LRU (least recently used). This is accomplished by keeping track of both frequently used and recently used pages plus a recent eviction history for both. The algorithm was developed at the IBM Almaden Research Center. In 2006, IBM was granted a patent for the adaptive replacement cache policy.\n\nBasic LRU maintains an ordered list (the cache directory) of resource entries in the cache, with the sort order based on the time of most recent access. New entries are added at the top of the list, after the bottom entry has been evicted. Cache hits move to the top, pushing all other entries down.\n\nARC improves the basic LRU strategy by splitting the cache directory into two lists, T1 and T2, for recently and frequently referenced entries. In turn, each of these is extended with a \"ghost\" list (B1 or B2), which is attached to the bottom of the two lists. These \"ghost\" lists act as scorecards by keeping track of the history of recently evicted cache entries, and the algorithm uses \"ghost\" hits to adapt to recent change in resource usage. Note that the \"ghost\" lists only contain metadata (keys for the entries) and not the resource data itself, i.e. as an entry is evicted into a \"ghost\" list its data is discarded. The combined cache directory is organised in four LRU lists:\nBULLET::::1. T1, for recent cache entries.\nBULLET::::2. T2, for frequent entries, referenced at least twice.\nBULLET::::3.

Page replacement happens when a requested page is not in memory (page fault) and a free page cannot be used to satisfy the allocation, either because there are none, or because the number of free pages is lower than some threshold.\nWhen the page that was selected for replacement and paged out is referenced again it has to be paged in (read in from disk), and this involves waiting for I/O completion. This determines the \"quality\" of the page replacement algorithm: the less time waiting for page-ins, the better the algorithm. A page replacement algorithm looks at the limited information about accesses to the pages provided by hardware, and tries to guess which pages should be replaced to minimize the total number of page misses, while balancing this with the costs (primary storage and processor time) of the algorithm itself.\nReplacement algorithms can be \"local\" or \"global.\" When a process incurs a page fault, a local page replacement algorithm selects for replacement some page that belongs to that same process (or a group of processes sharing a memory partition). A global replacement algorithm is free to select any page in memory.\nThere are a variety of page replacement algorithms:\nThe theoretically optimal page replacement algorithm (also known as OPT, clairvoyant replacement algorithm, or B\u00e9l\u00e1dy's optimal page replacement policy) is an algorithm that works as follows: when a page needs to be swapped in, the operating system swaps out the page whose next use will occur farthest in the future.\nLRU is a marking algorithm while FIFO is not a marking algorithm.

This determines the \"quality\" of the page replacement algorithm: the less time waiting for page-ins, the better the algorithm. A page replacement algorithm looks at the limited information about accesses to the pages provided by hardware, and tries to guess which pages should be replaced to minimize the total number of page misses, while balancing this with the costs (primary storage and processor time) of the algorithm itself.\n\nThe theoretically optimal page replacement algorithm (also known as OPT, clairvoyant replacement algorithm, or B\u00e9l\u00e1dy's optimal page replacement policy) is an algorithm that works as follows: when a page needs to be swapped in, the operating system swaps out the page whose next use will occur farthest in the future.

Since it is generally impossible to predict how far in the future information will be needed, this is generally not implementable in practice. The practical minimum can be calculated only after experimentation, and one can compare the effectiveness of the actually chosen cache algorithm.\n\nSection::::Policies.:First in first out (FIFO).\nUsing this algorithm the cache behaves in the same way as a FIFO queue.

Due to the inherent caching capability of nodes in Information-centric networking ICN, the ICN can be viewed as a loosely connect network of caches, which has unique requirements of Caching policies. Unlike proxy servers, in Information-centric networking the cache is a network level solution. Therefore, it has rapidly changing cache states and higher request arrival rates; moreover, smaller cache sizes further impose different kind of requirements on the content eviction policies. In particular, eviction policies for Information-centric networking should be fast and lightweight. Various cache replication and eviction schemes for different Information-centric networking architectures and applications are proposed.\n\nThe Time aware Least Recently Used (TLRU) is a variant of LRU designed for the situation where the stored contents in cache have a valid life time. The algorithm is suitable in network cache applications, such as Information-centric networking (ICN), Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and distributed networks in general. TLRU introduces a new term: TTU (Time to Use). TTU is a time stamp of a content/page which stipulates the usability time for the content based on the locality of the content and the content publisher announcement. Owing to this locality based time stamp, TTU provides more control to the local administrator to regulate in network storage.\n\nIn the TLRU algorithm, when a piece of content arrives, a cache node calculates the local TTU value based on the TTU value assigned by the content publisher. The local TTU value is calculated by using a locally defined function. Once the local TTU value is calculated the replacement of content is performed on a subset of the total content stored in cache node. The TLRU ensures that less popular and small life content should be replaced with the incoming content.\n\nThe Least Frequent Recently Used (LFRU) cache replacement scheme combines the benefits of LFU and LRU schemes. LFRU is suitable for \u2018in network\u2019 cache applications, such as Information-centric networking (ICN), Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and distributed networks in general. In LFRU, the cache is divided into two partitions called privileged and unprivileged partitions. The privileged partition can be defined as a protected partition. If content is highly popular, it is pushed into the privileged partition. Replacement of the privileged partition is done as follows: LFRU evicts content from the unprivileged partition, pushes content from privileged partition to unprivileged partition, and finally inserts new content into the privileged partition. In the above procedure the LRU is used for the privileged partition and an approximated LFU (ALFU) scheme is used for the unprivileged partition, hence the abbreviation LFRU.\n\nThe basic idea is to filter out the locally popular contents with ALFU scheme and push the popular contents to one of the privileged partition."], "wikipedia-52025020": ["Section::::Direct Mapped Cache.:To place a block in the cache.\nBULLET::::- The set is determined by the index bits derived from the address of the memory block.\nBULLET::::- The memory block is placed in the set identified and the tag is stored in the tag field associated with the set.\nBULLET::::- If the cache line is previously occupied, then the new data replaces the memory block in the cache.\nSection::::Fully Associative Cache.:To place a block in the cache.\nBULLET::::- The cache line is selected based on the valid bit associated with it.

LRU is actually a family of caching algorithms with members including 2Q by Theodore Johnson and Dennis Shasha, and LRU/K by Pat O'Neil, Betty O'Neil and Gerhard Weikum.\n\nThe access sequence for the below example is A B C D E D F.\nIn the above example once A B C D gets installed in the blocks with sequence numbers (Increment 1 for each new Access) and when E is accessed, it is a miss and it needs to be installed in one of the blocks. According to the LRU Algorithm, since A has the lowest Rank(A(0)), E will replace A.\n\nSection::::Policies.:Most recently used (MRU).\nDiscards, in contrast to LRU, the most recently used items first. In findings presented at the 11th VLDB conference, Chou and DeWitt noted that \"When a file is being repeatedly scanned in a [Looping Sequential] reference pattern, MRU is the best replacement algorithm.\" Subsequently, other researchers presenting at the 22nd VLDB conference noted that for random access patterns and repeated scans over large datasets (sometimes known as cyclic access patterns) MRU cache algorithms have more hits than LRU due to their tendency to retain older data. MRU algorithms are most useful in situations where the older an item is, the more likely it is to be accessed.\n\nThe access sequence for the below example is A B C D E C D B.\nHere, A B C D are placed in the cache as there is still space available. At the 5th access E, we see that the block which held D is now replaced with E as this block was used most recently. Another access to C and at the next access to D, C is replaced as it was the block accessed just before D and so on.\n\nSection::::Policies.:Pseudo-LRU (PLRU).\nFor CPU caches with large associativity (generally 4 ways), the implementation cost of LRU becomes prohibitive. In many CPU caches, a scheme that almost always discards one of the least recently used items is sufficient, so many CPU designers choose a PLRU algorithm which only needs one bit per cache item to work.\n\nPLRU typically has a slightly worse miss ratio, has a slightly better latency, uses slightly less power than LRU and lower overheads compared to LRU.\n\nThe following example shows how Bits work as a binary tree of 1-bit pointers that point to the less recently used subtree. Following the pointer chain to the leaf node identifies the replacement candidate. Upon an access all pointers in the chain from the accessed way's leaf node to the root node are set to point to subtree that does not contain the accessed way.\n\nThe access sequence is A B C D E.\nThe principle here is simple to understand if we only look at the arrow pointers. When there is an access to a value say 'A' and the we cannot find it in the cache then load it from memory and place it at the block where the arrows are pointing go from top to bottom and when you place that block make the arrows point away from that block go from bottom to top. In the above example we see how 'A' was placed followed by 'B', 'C and 'D'. Then as the cache became full 'E' replaced 'A' as that was where the arrows were pointing at that time. On the next access, the block where 'B' is being held will be replaced.\n\nSection::::Policies.:Random replacement ("], "wikipedia-58038703": ["In computing, cache algorithms (also frequently called cache replacement algorithms or cache replacement policies) are optimizing instructionsor algorithmsthat a computer program or a hardware-maintained structure can follow in order to manage a cache of information stored on the computer.

TLRU introduces a new term: TTU (Time to Use). TTU is a time stamp of a content/page which stipulates the usability time for the content based on the locality of the content and the content publisher announcement. Owing to this locality based time stamp, TTU provides more control to the local administrator to regulate in network storage.\nIn the TLRU algorithm, when a piece of content arrives, a cache node calculates the local TTU value based on the TTU value assigned by the content publisher. The local TTU value is calculated by using a locally defined function. Once the local TTU value is calculated the replacement of content is performed on a subset of the total content stored in cache node. The TLRU ensures that less popular and small life content should be replaced with the incoming content.\nSection::::Policies.:Least frequent recently used (LFRU).\nThe Least Frequent Recently Used (LFRU) cache replacement scheme combines the benefits of LFU and LRU schemes. LFRU is suitable for \u2018in network\u2019 cache applications, such as Information-centric networking (ICN), Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and distributed networks in general. In LFRU, the cache is divided into two partitions called privileged and unprivileged partitions. The privileged partition can be defined as a protected partition. If content is highly popular, it is pushed into the privileged partition. Replacement of the privileged partition is done as follows: LFRU evicts content from the unprivileged partition, pushes content from privileged partition to unprivileged partition, and finally inserts new content into the privileged partition. In the above procedure the LRU is used for the privileged partition and an approximated LFU (ALFU) scheme is used for the unprivileged partition, hence the abbreviation LFRU.\nThe basic idea is to filter out the locally popular contents with ALFU scheme and push the popular contents to one of the privileged partition."], "wikipedia-52025020": ["Section::::Fully Associative Cache.:To place a block in the cache.\nBULLET::::- The cache line is selected based on the valid bit associated with it.

MRU algorithms are most useful in situations where the older an item is, the more likely it is to be accessed.\nThe access sequence for the below example is A B C D E C D B.\nHere, A B C D are placed in the cache as there is still space available.

Following the pointer chain to the leaf node identifies the replacement candidate. Upon an access all pointers in the chain from the accessed way's leaf node to the root node are set to point to subtree that does not contain the accessed way.\nThe access sequence is A B C D E.\nThe principle here is simple to understand if we only look at the arrow pointers. When there is an access to a value say 'A' and the we cannot find it in the cache then load it from memory and place it at the block where the arrows are pointing go from top to bottom and when you place that block make the arrows point away from that block go from bottom to top. In the above example we see how 'A' was placed followed by 'B', 'C and 'D'. Then as the cache became full 'E' replaced 'A' as that was where the arrows were pointing at that time. On the next access, the block where 'B' is being held will be replaced."], "wikipedia-58038703": ["Section::::Policies.:Time aware least recently used (TLRU).\nThe Time aware Least Recently Used (TLRU) is a variant of LRU designed for the situation where the stored contents in cache have a valid life time. The algorithm is suitable in network cache applications, such as Information-centric networking (ICN), Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and distributed networks in general. TLRU introduces a new term: TTU (Time to Use). TTU is a time stamp of a content/page which stipulates the usability time for the content based on the locality of the content and the content publisher announcement. Owing to this locality based time stamp, TTU provides more control to the local administrator to regulate in network storage.\nIn the TLRU algorithm, when a piece of content arrives, a cache node calculates the local TTU value based on the TTU value assigned by the content publisher. The local TTU value is calculated by using a locally defined function. Once the local TTU value is calculated the replacement of content is performed on a subset of the total content stored in cache node. The TLRU ensures that less popular and small life content should be replaced with the incoming content.\nSection::::Policies.:Least frequent recently used (LFRU).\nThe Least Frequent Recently Used (LFRU) cache replacement scheme combines the benefits of LFU and LRU schemes. LFRU is suitable for \u2018in network\u2019 cache applications, such as Information-centric networking (ICN), Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and distributed networks in general. In LFRU, the cache is divided into two partitions called privileged and unprivileged partitions. The privileged partition can be defined as a protected partition. If content is highly popular, it is pushed into the privileged partition. Replacement of the privileged partition is done as follows: LFRU evicts content from the unprivileged partition, pushes content from privileged partition to unprivileged partition, and finally inserts new content into the privileged partition. In the above procedure the LRU is used for the privileged partition and an approximated LFU (ALFU) scheme is used for the unprivileged partition, hence the abbreviation LFRU.\nThe basic idea is to filter out the locally popular contents with ALFU scheme and push the popular contents to one of the privileged partition."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

When Lable-caching is in use, an NDN router only caches Data chunks whose IDs modulo k are equal to the assigned label l. It is obvious that both CEE and LCD deterministically save all Data chunks at a specific hop. The difference is the hop counts for each round. CEE starts to serve requests with the local copy since the second round. In Figure 2a, these chunks stay at the 2nd-hop for the rest of the rounds as the 2nd-hop router is the closest node equipped with CS. When LCD is using, the hop count for one round is always one hop closer to the client, until it arrives at the 2nd-hop router (Figure 2b). Lable-caching, however, caches chunks on multiple routers. This caching mechanism consistently keep chunks at specific hops. Duplicate Interests do not change the caching state. Figure 2c shows that all the rounds produce the same violin shape. Static probabilistic caching is the easiest way to achieve higher cache diversity without increasing the complexity. Figure 2 shows the profile of static probabilistic caching decisions with probability 20, 50, and 80, respectively, dubbed as Prob-20, Prob-50, and Prob-80.

There are explicit references to 'reasonable and probable grounds' in common law judgments, and in statutory authorities, across both State and Federal jurisdiction.\n\nIn the common law, there are two principles that must be developed, at the least, to form the reasonable and probable grounds necessary to act on certain powers. These principles are reasonable suspicion and what is reasonably necessary. Along with other considerations relevant to the circumstances of the case, the foundations of reasonable and probable grounds can be observed.\n\nOne avenue by which this has occurred is through the abstract development of reasonable suspicion. First discussed in 2001, reasonable suspicion is the legal standard that must be met before police officers can exercise certain powers. Reasonable suspicion is based on the information of the mind of the police officer at the time the power is actioned. It involves less than a reasonable belief, but more than a possibility. Additionally, it is not an arbitrary exercise of power.\n\nThere are ten propositions as to how a person forms reasonable suspicion as a state of mind. These are formed in the preliminary stage of investigation, and is objectively determined by the court whether the grounds for reasonable suspicion have been met. These propositions include:\nBULLET::::- Facts sufficient to induce that state of mind in a reasonable person.\nBULLET::::- A belief formed by the person arresting.\nBULLET::::- Accountability of the arresting police officer.\nBULLET::::- A factual basis for suspicion.\nBULLET::::- Objective circumstances that point clearly to the belief.\nBULLET::::- An inclination of the mind assenting to a belief, rather than rejecting.\nBULLET::::- What was known and reasonably capable of being known at the relevant time.\nBULLET::::- A belief that can be based on external information, but it cannot be directive.\nBULLET::::- Sources used to form a belief must be identifiable to the Court.\nBULLET::::- The executive discretion of police officers to arrest can only be questioned if the validity of the decision to arrest was not effectively exercised.\n\nWhat constitutes reasonable and probable grounds in the common law has also divulged from that what is reasonably necessary, and this is an unfettered judgment on all grounds. What is reasonably necessary is confined to an obligation that develops in the mind of the police officer to undertake an act that gives effect to the relevant police power.\n\nOn the whole spectrum, reasonable and probable grounds is based on tests of objectivity, incorporating rationality and proportionality. The role of the police officer in exercising police powers is to ensure that the relevant reasonable and probable grounds exist to justify the exercise of power. This remains a pertinent issue to the practicality of reasonable and probable grounds as it is open to interpretation, depending on the person exercising the power."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

In this paper, we focus on detecting the caching decision algorithms. As the background to understanding our results, this section presents the different caching decision algorithms that have been implemented in NDN networks. We conclude this section with a brief discussion of cache replacement, though we do not measure it in our study.\n3.1 Caching Decision\nThe caching decision is to determine whether a packet will be stored in the CS or discarded. Typically, an NDN node needs to make such a decision when a Data packet arrives at an NDN node that does not have the packet in its CS.\n3.1.1 Cache Everything Everywhere (CEE). CEE is the most straightforward caching decision strategy. With CEE as the strategy, NDN nodes attempt to cache every incoming Data packet that is not already in their CS. Caching Data packets everywhere provides the rapid replication of all available Data packets through the network. Due to its simplicity, the CEE strategy is widely used in NDN networks.\nCEE leads to high redundancy, especially in a strongly connected network [13]. This redundancy can hurt the overall caching efficiency of a network. In a network with severely limited caching capabilities, CEE is likely to waste precious caching resources.\nCaching efficiency can be measured using diversity [13], which is the ratio of unique content objects in all caches to unique content producers. Other advanced caching strategies attempt to maximize this metric by ensuring different router saves different Data packets.\n3.1.2 Leave Copy Down (LCD). NDN networks with the LCD caching policy always cache Data packets only at the first node to receive the Data [14].

CEE is the most straightforward caching decision strategy. With CEE as the strategy, NDN nodes attempt to cache every incoming Data packet that is not already in their CS. Caching Data packets everywhere provides the rapid replication of all available Data packets through the network. Due to its simplicity, the CEE strategy is widely used in NDN networks.\nCEE leads to high redundancy, especially in a strongly connected network [13]. This redundancy can hurt the overall caching efficiency of a network. In a network with severely limited caching capabilities, CEE is likely to waste precious caching resources.\nCaching efficiency can be measured using diversity [13], which is the ratio of unique content objects in all caches to unique content producers. Other advanced caching strategies attempt to maximize this metric by ensuring different router saves different Data packets.\n3.1.2 Leave Copy Down (LCD). NDN networks with the LCD caching policy always cache Data packets only at the first node to receive the Data [14]. The 'first node' is the next hop from the node where the cache hit occurred towards the consumer.\nLCD is chosen when the network wants to improve the caching diversity without introducing complex communication into the caching process. LCD tends to keep Data packets close to the producer in the retrieval process, and the saved copy could alleviate the load on the producer as long as it stays on the data retrieval path.\n3.1.3 Static Probabilistic Caching.

Data packets pass through routers as they travel between source and destination. The hop count refers to the number of intermediate devices through which data must pass between source and destination.\nSince store and forward and other latencies are incurred through each hop, a large number of hops between source and destination implies lower real-time performance.\nSection::::Hop count.\nThe hop count refers to the number of intermediate network devices through which data must pass between source and destination. Hop count is a rough measure of distance between two hosts. A hop count of \"n\" means that \"n\" network devices separate the source host from the destination host.\nOn a layer 3 network such as Internet Protocol (IP), each router along the data path constitutes a hop. By itself, this metric is, however, not useful for determining the optimum network path, as it does not take into consideration the speed, load, reliability, or latency of any particular hop, but merely the total count. Nevertheless, some routing protocols, such as Routing Information Protocol (RIP), use hop count as their sole metric.\nEach time a router receives a packet, it modifies the packet, decrementing the time to live (TTL).

The only exception is LCD.\n\nHowever, we can still use the method to identify the LCD mechanism. Figure 4b demonstrates that LCD cannot move forward to lower hops after hop nine (client node is the first hop) in the presence of cross traffic at router eight. LCD initializes the forwarding tag to one when a cached chunk is pulled out. If the Data chunk is evicted, the router is unable to attach such a tag, and the next-hop cannot receive a chunk that contains a caching signal. When the cross traffic happens at router three, the plot becomes a Violin shape when chunks reach the third router (Figure 4a). We can see that samples are not stuck at hop four, but round 8, 9, and 10 contain samples with deviations. In this case, the competition happens close to the client.

The proposed formula integrates individual stimulus response time, driving experience, scenario specific requirements and allows increased safety for takeover maneuvers.

In the case of DRAM circuits, this might be served by having a wider data bus. For example, consider a program accessing bytes in a 32-bit address space, but being served by a 128-bit off-chip data bus; individual uncached byte accesses would allow only 1/16th of the total bandwidth to be used, and 80% of the data movement would be memory addresses instead of data itself.

The HopLimit is an Interest field to limit the number of hops the Interest is allowed to be forwarded [21]. To figure out the hop count of a chunk, the client needs to send out an Interest that starts with HopLimit one. If no data is received, it increments the HopLimit value to two and sends out the same interest until a data packet comes back. This approach has two issues. First, the client must send Interests to cover all hops until an Interest reaches the router that contains the data chunk. Most Interests are wasted without any Data chunks returned. These Interests introduce overhead not only into the bandwidth but also the PIT. Second, the measurement with HopLimit will be time-consuming. Interest has to wait until it times out when no Data comes back. No better way to speed up the measurement process without affecting the caching states.

In NDN, consumers request uniquely named content, using an Interest packet, and the network then seeks to fulfill the request with a Data packet that contains the uniquely named content. Because content is uniquely named, it can be cached in routers\u2019 local storage (in NDN, the Content Store ). Every time a router sees a Data packet, it must decide whether to cache the packet, hoping that there will be a later Interest for the same content.\n\nCaching can decrease consumers\u2019 access latency. Caching can also reduce loads on the producers of data. Because duplicate or later requests for the same content can be satisfied from caches in routers, producers are less likely to be overwhelmed when their content is popular.\n\nIn-network caching systems\u2019 performance depends on many factors, such as content popularity, the routing of content request packets, when routers decide to cache, when the cache is full, and, how routers decide which content to replace with new content. Furthermore, experiments suggest that different caching approaches may better serve different applications. A number of different NDN caching policies have been developed (see section 3). Since a caching policy can be applied to a specific name prefix, ISPs have the potential to provide differentiated caching services or other novel caching-related content services. Different routers in an NDN network may implement different caching policies."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-36831006": 1, "wikipedia-10997": 1, "wikipedia-32264926": 1, "wikipedia-22824905": 1, "wikipedia-12700423": 1, "wikipedia-1096354": 1, "wikipedia-31966459": 1, "wikipedia-954281": 1, "wikipedia-235110": 1, "wikipedia-12747637": 1, "arxiv-1902.10932": 1, "arxiv-1407.1402": 1, "arxiv-2106.06945": 1, "arxiv-1502.06085": 1, "arxiv-2212.13323": 1, "arxiv-1905.01011": 1, "arxiv-1903.10071": 1, "arxiv-1201.2575": 1, "arxiv-1810.12589": 1, "arxiv-1805.11537": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/43": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/46": 2, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/24": 2, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/36": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/45": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/20": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/5": 2, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/34": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/3": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-36831006": 1, "wikipedia-10997": 1, "wikipedia-32264926": 1, "wikipedia-22824905": 1, "wikipedia-12700423": 1, "wikipedia-1096354": 1, "wikipedia-31966459": 1, "wikipedia-954281": 1, "wikipedia-235110": 1, "wikipedia-12747637": 1, "arxiv-1902.10932": 1, "arxiv-1407.1402": 1, "arxiv-2106.06945": 1, "arxiv-1502.06085": 1, "arxiv-2212.13323": 1, "arxiv-1905.01011": 1, "arxiv-1903.10071": 1, "arxiv-1201.2575": 1, "arxiv-1810.12589": 1, "arxiv-1805.11537": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/43": 2, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/46": 3, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/17": 2, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/24": 3, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/36": 2, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/45": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/20": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/5": 3, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/34": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/3": 2}}}

In electronic engineering and control theory, step response is the time behaviour of the outputs of a general system when its inputs change from zero to one in a very short time. The concept can be extended to the abstract mathematical notion of a dynamical system using an evolution parameter.\n\nThe step response can be described by the following quantities related to its time behavior,\n- overshoot\n- rise time\n- settling time\n- ringing\n\nThe one-pole amplifier's transfer function leads to the closed-loop gain:\nThis closed-loop gain is of the same form as the open-loop gain: a one-pole filter. Its step response is of the same form: an exponential decay toward the new equilibrium value. But the time constant of the closed-loop step function is \u03c4 / (1 + \u03b2 \"A\"), so it is faster than the forward amplifier's response by a factor of 1 + \u03b2 \"A\":\nAs the feedback factor \u03b2 is increased, the step response will get faster, until the original assumption of one dominant pole is no longer accurate. If there is a second pole, then as the closed-loop time constant approaches the time constant of the second pole, a two-pole analysis is needed.\n\nThe time dependence of the amplifier is easy to discover by switching variables to \"s\" = \"j\"\u03c9, whereupon the gain becomes:\nThe poles of this expression (that is, the zeros of the denominator) occur at:\nwhich shows for large enough values of \u03b2A\" the square root becomes the square root of a negative number, that is the square root becomes imaginary, and the pole positions are complex conjugate numbers, either \"s\" or \"s\"; see Figure 2:\n\nTables of Laplace transforms show that the time response of such a system is composed of combinations of the two functions:\nwhich is to say, the solutions are damped oscillations in time. In particular, the unit step response of the system is:\nwhich simplifies to\nwhen \"A\" tends to infinity and the feedback factor \u03b2 is one.\n\nNotice that the damping of the response is set by \u03c1, that is, by the time constants of the open-loop amplifier. In contrast, the frequency of oscillation is set by \u03bc, that is, by the feedback parameter through \u03b2\"A\". Because \u03c1 is a sum of reciprocals of time constants, it is interesting to notice that \u03c1 is dominated by the \"shorter\" of the two.\n\nFigure 3 shows the time response to a unit step input for three values of the parameter \u03bc. It can be seen that the frequency of oscillation increases with \u03bc, but the oscillations are contained between the two asymptotes set by the exponentials [\u00a01\u00a0\u2212\u00a0exp\u00a0(\u2212\u03c1t)\u00a0] and [\u00a01\u00a0+\u00a0exp(\u2212\u03c1t)\u00a0]. These asymptotes are determined by \u03c1 and therefore by the time constants of the open-loop amplifier, independent of feedback.\nThe phenomenon of oscillation about the final value is called ringing. The overshoot is the maximum swing above final value, and clearly increases with \u03bc. Likewise, the undershoot is the minimum swing below final value, again increasing with \u03bc.

The ensemble evolution is given by the Liouville equation (classical mechanics) or the von Neumann equation (quantum mechanics).

In electronic engineering and control theory, step response is the time behaviour of the outputs of a general system when its inputs change from zero to one in a very short time. The concept can be extended to the abstract mathematical notion of a dynamical system using an evolution parameter.\nFrom a practical standpoint, knowing how the system responds to a sudden input is important because large and possibly fast deviations from the long term steady state may have extreme effects on the component itself and on other portions of the overall system dependent on this component. In addition, the overall system cannot act until the component's output settles down to some vicinity of its final state, delaying the overall system response. Formally, knowing the step response of a dynamical system gives information on the stability of such a system, and on its ability to reach one stationary state when starting from another.\nSection::::Time domain \"versus\" frequency domain.\nInstead of frequency response, system performance may be specified in terms of parameters describing time-dependence of response. The step response can be described by the following quantities related to its time behavior,\nBULLET::::- overshoot\nBULLET::::- rise time\nBULLET::::- settling time\nBULLET::::- ringing\nIn the case of linear dynamic systems, much can be inferred about the system from these characteristics.

When the probability is 80 (Figure 2d), data chunks are quickly cached at the closest hop to the client. Probability 50 makes the process much slower. Even when most chunks are cached one hop away, it still takes another six probing rounds to cache all chunks at the 2nd-hop router (Figure 2e).

Each PIT entry records the data name carried in the Interest, together with its incoming and outgoing interface(s).\nBULLET::::- Forwarding Information Base (FIB): a routing table which maps name components to interfaces. The FIB itself is populated by a name-prefix based routing protocol, and can have multiple output interfaces for each prefix.\nBULLET::::- Content Store (CS): a temporary cache of Data packets the router has received. Because an NDN Data packet is meaningful independent of where it comes from or where it is forwarded, it can be cached to satisfy future Interests. Replacement strategy is traditionally least recently used, but the replacement strategy is determined by the router and may differ.\nBULLET::::- Forwarding Strategies: a series of policies and rules about forwarding interest and data packets. Note that the Forwarding Strategy may decide to drop an Interest in certain situations, e.g., if all upstream links are congested or the Interest is suspected to be part of a DoS attack. These strategies use a series of triggers in the forwarding pipeline and are assigned to name prefixes. For instance, by default /localhost uses the Multicast forwarding strategy to forward interests and data to any local application running on a client NFD. The default forwarding strategy (i.e. \"/\") is the Best Route forwarding strategy.\nWhen an Interest packet arrives, an NDN router first checks the Content Store for matching data; if it exists in the router returns the Data packet on the interface from which the Interest came. Otherwise the router looks up the name in its PIT, and if a matching entry exists, it simply records the incoming interface of this Interest in the PIT entry.

This cache is placed in the ISP\u2019s network, either co-located with the Internet transit links or placed at key aggregation points or at each cable head-end.\nOnce a P2P cache is established, the network will transparently redirect P2P traffic to the cache, which either serves the file directly or passes the request on to a remote P2P user and simultaneously caches that data for the next user. To what extent the caching is beneficial depends on how similar the content interests of ISP's customers. Due to relatively small number of content shared in P2P systems (compared to Web) and semantic, geographic, and organization interests of users sharing ratio in P2P can be significantly higher than HTTP/Web caching.\nP2P caching typically works with a network traffic-mitigation technology called Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).

In essence, several ACK responses may be combined together into a single response, reducing protocol overhead. However, in some circumstances, the technique can reduce application performance.\n\nAs described in RFC 1122, a host may delay sending an ACK response by up to 500 ms. Additionally, with a stream of full-sized incoming segments, ACK responses must be sent for every second segment.\n\nDelayed ACKs can give the application the opportunity to update the TCP receive window and also possibly to send an immediate response along with the ACK. For certain protocols such as Telnet, delayed ACKs can reduce the number of responses sent by the server by a factor of 3, by combining the ACK, window update and the response data into one segment.\n\nThe additional wait time introduced by the delayed ACK can cause further delays when interacting with certain applications and configurations. If Nagle's algorithm is being used by the sending party, data will be queued by the sender until an ACK is received. If the sender does not send enough data to fill the maximum segment size (for example, if it performs two small writes followed by a blocking read) then the transfer will pause up to the ACK delay timeout. Linux 2.4.4+ supports a codice_1 socket option that disables delayed ACK.\n\nFor example, consider a situation where Bob is sending data to Carol. Bob's socket layer has less than a complete packet's worth of data remaining to send. Per Nagle's algorithm, it will not be sent until he receives an ACK for the data that has already been sent. At the same time, Carol's application layer will not send a response until it gets all of the data. If Carol is using delayed ACKs, her socket layer will not send an ACK until the timeout is reached.\n\nIf the application is transmitting data in smaller chunks and expecting periodic acknowledgment replies, this negative interaction can occur. To prevent this delay, the application layer needs to continuously send data without waiting for acknowledgment replies. Alternatively, Nagle's algorithm may be disabled by the application on the sending side."], "wikipedia-1753169": ["Nagle's algorithm works by combining a number of small outgoing messages and sending them all at once. Specifically, as long as there is a sent packet for which the sender has received no acknowledgment, the sender should keep buffering its output until it has a full packet's worth of output, thus allowing output to be sent all at once.\nThis algorithm interacts badly with TCP delayed acknowledgments (delayed ACK), a feature introduced into TCP at roughly the same time in the early 1980s, but by a different group. With both algorithms enabled, applications that do two successive writes to a TCP connection, followed by a read that will not be fulfilled until after the data from the second write has reached the destination, experience a constant delay of up to 500 milliseconds, the \"ACK delay\".

In Figure 2a, these chunks stay at the 2nd-hop for the rest of the rounds as the 2nd-hop router is the closest node equipped with CS. When LCD is using, the hop count for one round is always one hop closer to the client, until it arrives at the 2nd-hop router (Figure 2b). Lable-caching, however, caches chunks on multiple routers. This caching mechanism consistently keep chunks at specific hops. Duplicate Interests do not change the caching state. Figure 2c shows that all the rounds produce the same violin shape.\nStatic probabilistic caching is the easiest way to achieve higher cache diversity without increasing the complexity. Figure 2 shows the profile of static probabilistic caching decisions with probability 20, 50, and 80, respectively, dubbed as Prob-20, Prob-50, and Prob-80.\nComparing with CEE and LCD, a major difference is that cached chunks have various hop count within one round when static prob-abolic caching decisions are in use. Data chunks disperse along the path with some probability and form a violin shape."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-19769202": 1, "wikipedia-17164795": 1, "wikipedia-59144574": 1, "wikipedia-29053065": 1, "wikipedia-669120": 1, "wikipedia-450541": 1, "wikipedia-36197584": 1, "wikipedia-8501": 1, "wikipedia-37360516": 1, "wikipedia-27206776": 1, "arxiv-2402.16374": 1, "arxiv-1310.4906": 1, "arxiv-2006.10305": 1, "arxiv-1709.08501": 1, "arxiv-2302.13875": 1, "arxiv-2205.12535": 1, "arxiv-2412.19229": 1, "arxiv-2306.10447": 1, "arxiv-1806.07158": 1, "arxiv-2404.05168": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/42": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/32": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/38": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/19": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/26": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/24": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/46": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/4": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-19769202": 1, "wikipedia-17164795": 1, "wikipedia-59144574": 1, "wikipedia-29053065": 1, "wikipedia-669120": 1, "wikipedia-450541": 1, "wikipedia-36197584": 1, "wikipedia-8501": 1, "wikipedia-37360516": 1, "wikipedia-27206776": 1, "arxiv-2402.16374": 1, "arxiv-1310.4906": 1, "arxiv-2006.10305": 1, "arxiv-1709.08501": 1, "arxiv-2302.13875": 1, "arxiv-2205.12535": 1, "arxiv-2412.19229": 1, "arxiv-2306.10447": 1, "arxiv-1806.07158": 1, "arxiv-2404.05168": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/42": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/32": 2, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/38": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/35": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/19": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/26": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/24": 2, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/46": 1, "paper/37/3405656.3418711.jsonl/4": 1}}}

LCD always caches Data chunks at the next hop from the node where the cache hit occurred. When Lable-caching is in use, an NDN router only caches Data chunks whose IDs modulo k are equal to the assigned label l. It is obvious that both CEE and LCD deterministically save all Data chunks at a specific hop. The difference is the hop counts for each round. CEE starts to serve requests with the local copy since the second round. In Figure 2a, these chunks stay at the 2nd-hop for the rest of the rounds as the 2nd-hop router is the closest node equipped with CS. When LCD is using, the hop count for one round is always one hop closer to the client, until it arrives at the 2nd-hop router (Figure 2b). Lable-caching, however, caches chunks on multiple routers. This caching mechanism consistently keep chunks at specific hops. Duplicate Interests do not change the caching state. Figure 2c shows that all the rounds produce the same violin shape. Static probabilistic caching is the easiest way to achieve higher cache diversity without increasing the complexity. Figure 2 shows the profile of static probabilistic caching decisions with probability 20, 50, and 80, respectively, dubbed as Prob-20, Prob-50, and Prob-80.

Slow response times and poor contrast are typical of passive-matrix addressed LCDs with too many pixels and driven according to the \"Alt & Pleshko\" drive scheme. High-resolution color displays, such as modern LCD computer monitors and televisions, use an active-matrix structure. A matrix of thin-film transistors (TFTs) is added to the electrodes in contact with the LC layer. Each pixel has its own dedicated transistor, allowing each column line to access one pixel. When a row line is selected, all of the column lines are connected to a row of pixels and voltages corresponding to the picture information are driven onto all of the column lines. The row line is then deactivated and the next row line is selected. All of the row lines are selected in sequence during a refresh operation. Active-matrix addressed displays look brighter and sharper than passive-matrix addressed displays of the same size, and generally have quicker response times, producing much better images. Twisted nematic displays contain liquid crystals that twist and untwist at varying degrees to allow light to pass through. When no voltage is applied to a TN liquid crystal cell, polarized light passes through the 90-degrees twisted LC layer. In proportion to the voltage applied, the liquid crystals untwist changing the polarization and blocking the light's path. By properly adjusting the level of the voltage almost any gray level or transmission can be achieved. In-plane switching is an LCD technology that aligns the liquid crystals in a plane parallel to the glass substrates. In this method, the electrical field is applied through opposite electrodes on the same glass substrate, so that the liquid crystals can be reoriented (switched) essentially in the same plane, although fringe fields inhibit a homogeneous reorientation. Vertical-alignment displays are a form of LCDs in which the liquid crystals naturally align vertically to the glass substrates. When no voltage is applied, the liquid crystals remain perpendicular to the substrate, creating a black display between crossed polarizers. When voltage is applied, the liquid crystals shift to a tilted position, allowing light to pass through and create a gray-scale display depending on the amount of tilt generated by the electric field."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

When the probability is 80 (Figure 2d), data chunks are quickly cached at the closest hop to the client. Probability 50 makes the process much slower. Even when most chunks are cached one hop away, it still takes another six probing rounds to cache all chunks at the 2nd-hop router (Figure 2e). Prob-20 is the worst one in terms of the time to cache all chunks at the 2nd-hop router (Figure 2f). After ten rounds, some chunks are still not cached at the closest router.

After examination of ICCs and subsequent suspicion of DIF, statistical procedures are implemented to test differences between parameter estimates. \nICCs represent mathematical functions of the relationship between positioning on the latent trait continuum and the probability of giving a particular response. Figure 3 illustrates this relationship as a logistic function. Individuals lower on the latent trait or with less ability have a lower probability of getting a correct response or endorsing an item, especially as difficulty increases. Thus, those higher on the latent trait or in ability have a greater chance of a correct response or endorsing an item. For instance, on a depression inventory, highly depressed individuals would have a greater probability of endorsing an item than individuals with lower depression. Similarly, individuals with higher math ability have a greater probability of getting a math item correct than those with lesser ability. Another critical aspect of ICCs pertains to the inflection point. This is the point on the curve where the probability of a particular response is .5 and also represents the maximum value for the slope. This inflection point indicates where the probability of a correct response or endorsing an item becomes greater than 50%, except when a \"c\" parameter is greater than 0 which then places the inflection point at 1 + c/2 (a description will follow below).

By itself, this metric is, however, not useful for determining the optimum network path, as it does not take into consideration the speed, load, reliability, or latency of any particular hop, but merely the total count. Nevertheless, some routing protocols, such as Routing Information Protocol (RIP), use hop count as their sole metric.\nEach time a router receives a packet, it modifies the packet, decrementing the time to live (TTL). The router discards any packets received with a zero TTL value. This prevents packets from endlessly bouncing around the network in the event of routing errors. Routers are capable of managing hop counts, but other types of network devices (e.g. Ethernet hubs and bridges) are not.\nSection::::Hop limit.\nKnown as \"time to live\" (TTL) in IPv4, and \"hop limit\" in IPv6, this field specifies a limit on the number of hops a packet is allowed before being discarded. Routers modify IP packets as they are forwarded, decrementing the respective TTL or hop limit fields. Routers do not forward packets with a resultant field of 0 or less. This prevents packets from following a loop forever."], "wikipedia-11092014": ["Named data networking (NDN) (related to content-centric networking (CCN), content-based networking, data-oriented networking or information-centric networking (ICN)) is a proposed Future Internet architecture inspired by years of empirical research into network usage and a growing awareness of unsolved problems in contemporary internet architectures like IP. NDN has its roots in an earlier project, Content-Centric Networking (CCN), which Van Jacobson first publicly presented in 2006. The NDN project is investigating Jacobson's proposed evolution from today's host-centric network architecture IP to a data-centric network architecture (NDN). The belief is that this conceptually simple shift will have far-reaching implications for how people design, develop, deploy, and use networks and applications.\nIts premise is that the Internet is primarily used as an information distribution network, which is not a good match for IP, and that the future Internet's \"thin waist\" should be based on named data rather than numerically addressed hosts. The underlying principle is that a communication network should allow a user to focus on the data he or she needs, named \"content\", rather than having to reference a specific, physical location where that data is to be retrieved from, named \"hosts\". The motivation for this is derived from the fact that the vast majority of current Internet usage (a \"high 90% level of traffic\") consists of data being disseminated from a source to a number of users. Named-data networking comes with potential for a wide range of benefits such as content caching to reduce congestion and improve delivery speed, simpler configuration of network devices, and building security into the network at the data level.\n\nCommunication in NDN is driven by receivers i.e., data consumers, through the exchange of two types of packets: Interest and Data. Both types of packets carry a name that identifies a piece of data that can be transmitted in one Data packet. \nPacket Types\nBULLET::::- Interest: A consumer puts the name of a desired piece of data into an Interest packet and sends it to the network. Routers use this name to forward the Interest toward the data producer(s).\nBULLET::::- Data: Once the Interest reaches a node that has the requested data, the node will return a Data packet that contains both the name and the content, together with a signature by the producer's key which binds the two. This Data packet follows in reverse the path taken by the Interest to get back to the requesting consumer.\n\nTo carry out the Interest and Data packet forwarding functions, each NDN router maintains three data structures, and a forwarding policy:\nBULLET::::- Pending Interest Table (PIT): stores all the Interests that a router has forwarded but not satisfied yet. Each PIT entry records the data name carried in the Interest, together with its incoming and outgoing interface(s).\nBULLET::::- Forwarding Information Base (FIB): a routing table which maps name components to interfaces. The FIB itself is populated by a name-prefix based routing protocol, and can have multiple output interfaces for each prefix.\nBULLET::::- Content Store (CS): a temporary cache of Data packets the router has received. Because an NDN Data packet is meaningful independent of where it comes from or where it is forwarded, it can be cached to satisfy future Interests. Replacement strategy is traditionally least recently used, but the replacement strategy is determined by the router and may differ.\nBULLET::::- Forwarding Strategies: a series of policies and rules about forwarding interest and data packets. Note that the Forwarding Strategy may decide to drop an Interest in certain situations, e.g., if all upstream links are congested or the Interest is suspected to be part of a DoS attack. These strategies use a series of triggers in the forwarding pipeline and are assigned to name prefixes. For instance, by default /localhost uses the Multicast forwarding strategy to forward interests and data to any local application running on a client NFD. The default forwarding strategy (i.e. \"/\") is the Best Route forwarding strategy.\nWhen an Interest packet arrives, an NDN router first checks the Content Store for matching data; if it exists in the router returns the Data packet on the interface from which the Interest came. Otherwise the router looks up the name in its PIT, and if a matching entry exists, it simply records the incoming interface of this Interest in the PIT entry. In the absence of a matching PIT entry, the router will forward"]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

LCD always caches Data chunks at the next hop from the node where the cache hit occurred. When Lable-caching is in use, an NDN router only caches Data chunks whose IDs modulo k are equal to the assigned label l. It is obvious that both CEE and LCD deterministically save all Data chunks at a specific hop. The difference is the hop counts for each round. CEE starts to serve requests with the local copy since the second round. In Figure 2a, these chunks stay at the 2nd-hop for the rest of the rounds as the 2nd-hop router is the closest node equipped with CS. When LCD is using, the hop count for one round is always one hop closer to the client, until it arrives at the 2nd-hop router (Figure 2b). Lable-caching, however, caches chunks on multiple routers.

Gaining a bit of distance from negative feelings is exactly what such moments call for, especially on the part of the person with (presumably) the greatest maturity. \"Problem ownership\" is defined as deciding who should take ownership of the behavior or conflict in the issue (Gordon, 2003). The main person who is bothered by the root problem is also the \u201cowner\u201d of the problem, and thus the owner of a problem needs to be the one who takes primary responsibility for solving the issue. Identifying ownership makes a difference in how behavior is dealt with, as well as how the problem is effectively solved. It is important to ask clarifying questions to really understand the root causes of the conflict.\nStep 2: Active listening\nSeveral strategies help with distinguishing who has a problem with a behavior and who takes ownership. One of those strategies is active listening. Active listening is attending carefully to all aspects of what a student says and attempting to understand or empathize as much as one can (Seifert & Sutton). Active listening consists of continually asking questions in order to test your understanding. It also requires giving encouragement to the student by letting them tell their story, and paraphrasing what the student says so you can form an unbiased conclusion. It is key not to move too quickly at solving the problem by just giving advice, instructions, or scolding. Responding too soon with solutions can shut down the student\u2019s communication and leave you with inaccurate impressions of the source or nature of the problem (Seifert & Sutton).\nStep 3: Assertive discipline and I-messages\nOnce you, as the teacher, have taken in the student\u2019s point of view, form your comments around how the student\u2019s behavior affects your role. Your comments should be assertive, emphasize I-messages, and encourage the student to think about the effects of his or her behavior. They should not be passive, apologetic, hostile or aggressive, but matter-of-fact, such as, \u201cCharlie, you are talking while I am talking.\u201d The comments should emphasize I-messages that focus on how the behavior is affecting the teacher\u2019s teaching and the other students' learning (Seifert & Sutton). An example of this would be, \u201cYou are making it hard for me to focus on teaching this math lesson.\u201d Lastly, you should ask the student more open-ended questions that make him or her think about the consequences of his or her behavior, such as, \u201cHow do the other kids feel when you yell in the middle of class?\u201d (Seifert & Sutton). \nBULLET::::- The comments should encourage the student to think about the effects of his or her actions on others\u2014-a strategy that in effect encourages the student to consider the ethical implications of the actions (Gibbs, 2003). Instead of simply saying, \u201cWhen you cut in line ahead of the other kids, that was not fair to them\u201d, you can try asking, \u201cHow do you think the other kids feel when you cut in line ahead of them?\u201d\nStep 4: Negotiation\nSeifert and Sutton state that the first three steps describe desirable ways of handling situations that are specific and last for only a short time. These steps by themselves could potentially not be enough when conflicts persist over extended periods of time. Often it is better to negotiate a solution in these situations. Negotiating is defined as methodically deliberating various options and deciding on one if possible (Seifert & Sutton). Even though negotiation demands time and energy, it often demands less time or effort ultimately than continuing to cope with the problem. The results of negotiation can be valuable to everyone involved in the situation. Various experts on conflict resolution have suggested different ways to negotiate with students about problems that are continual (Seifert & Sutton). The theories differ in specifics, but typically are generally similar to the steps we previously discussed:\nBULLET::::- Determine what the problem is\u2014involves active listening\nBULLET::::- Discuss and share possible solutions, consider their efficacy\nBULLET::::- Attempt to reach a consensus: Total agreement on the subject will not always be possible, but should be set as your end goal\nBULLET::::- Assess the success of the decision: Renegotiation might be necessary."], "wikipedia-3424303": ["The Four-Step Impact Assessment:\nBULLET::::1.

Be committed to taking some risks in responding to problems.\nWhere, under a traditional system, a patrol officer might answer repeated calls to a certain problem area or \"hot spot\" and deal only with each individual incident, that officer is encouraged under POP to discover the root cause of the problem and come up with ways of solving it. The goal is to find a cure for the ailment instead of merely treating the symptoms. Some might confuse community-oriented policing with problem-oriented policing, but the main focus of community-oriented policing is the improvement of the relationship between law enforcement and the citizens, while problem-oriented policing is depending on information of the citizens and a good relationship with the community.\nThe exploration of possible responses to a problem is handled by patrol officers. Once a problem is identified, officers are expected to work closely with community members to develop a solution, which can include a wide range of alternatives to arrest. Problem-oriented policing gives law enforcement a model for addressing the conditions that created and caused other problems of concern to the community. Communities must ensure law enforcement are addressing and responding to concerns of citizens. Problem-oriented policing is predicated on community involvement and support is key if law enforcement hopes to rectify crime. In SARA, \u201cScanning\u201d is the first step and require police identifying and prioritizing potential problems in their jurisdiction. Second, the acronym \u201cA\u201d stands for analysis, for example analyzing the time of day when incidents occur, determining who the offenders are and why they prefer the park and investigate the particular areas of the park that are most conducive to the activity. In addition, evaluating their environmental design characteristics. Analysis also involves the police to use data sources, so the proper responses can be manifested. The third step, response, has the police develop and implement interventions designed to rectify the problems. The final step is assessment, which involves evaluating the impact of the response and what good has been accomplished."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

By clearly identifying the problem, finite resources can be directed towards developing and implementing a feasible and applicable solution. Gathering appropriate and sufficient data informs the process of developing an effective product that will address the groups needs and wants.

There is a sort of agreement between targets and aggressors on this curve. Their judgements of badness compared to goodness of each other are analogous on CRC. So, arrival of all conflicting entities to some negotiable points on CRC is important before peace building.\nConflict resolution is an expanding field of professional practice, both in the U.S. and around the world. The escalating costs of conflict have increased use of third parties who may serve as a conflict specialists to resolve conflicts. In fact, relief and development organizations have added peace-building specialists to their teams. Many major international non-governmental organizations have seen a growing need to hire practitioners trained in conflict analysis and resolution. Furthermore, this expansion has resulted in the need for conflict resolution practitioners to work in a variety of settings such as in businesses, court systems, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and educational institutions throughout the world.\nIn Western cultural contexts, such as Canada and the United States, successful conflict resolution usually involves fostering communication among disputants, problem solving, and drafting agreements that meet underlying needs. In these situations, conflict resolvers often talk about finding a mutually satisfying (\"win-win\") solution for everyone involved.\nIn many non-Western cultural contexts, such as Afghanistan, Vietnam, and China, it is also important to find \"win-win\" solutions; however, the routes taken to find them may be very different. In these contexts, direct communication between disputants that explicitly addresses the issues at stake in the conflict can be perceived as very rude, making the conflict worse and delaying resolution.

The main focus within the vision should be on the company\u2019s core business and how the SAP solution will better enable that core business to be successful. Next to that, the shortcomings of the current systems should be described and short but clear requirements should be provided regarding availability (uptime), security, manageability and scalability of the SAP system.\nIdentify high availability and disaster recovery requirements\nThe next step is identifying the high availability requirements and the more serious disaster recovery requirements. This is to plan what to do with later downtime of the SAP system, caused by e.g. hardware failures, application failures or power outages. It should be noted that it is very important to calculate the cost of downtime, so that an organization has a good idea of its actual availability requirements.\nEngage SAP solution stack vendors\nA true sizing process is to engage the SAP solution stack vendors, which is the next step. This means selecting the best SAP hardware and software technology partners for all layers and components of the solution stack, based on a side-by-side sizing comparison. The most important factors that are of influence here are the estimated numbers of (concurrent) users and batch sizes. A wise thing to do is to involve SAP SE itself to let them create a sizing proposal stating the advised solution stack, before moving to SAP's technology partners/SAP vendors, like Accenture, HP and IBM. A simplified solution stack is depicted at the right, showing the many layers for which software and hardware has to be acquired. Note the overlap with the OSI model.\nStaff TSO\nThe TSO (Technical Support Organisation) is the most important resource for an organization that is implementing SAP, so staffing the TSO is a vital job which can consume a lot of time. In a previous phase, the organization should already have staffed the most vital positions. At this point the organization should staff the bulk of the TSO, i.e. fill the positions that directly support the near-term objectives of the implementation, which are to develop and begin the installation/implementation of the SAP data center. Examples are: data center experts, network infrastructure experts, security specialists and database administration experts.\nTraining\nOne of the most vital stages of the implementation process is training. Few people within an organization are SAP experts or even have worked with SAP software. It is therefore important to train the end users but especially the SAP TSO: the people who design and implement the solution. The usual activity is to train a group of key users who in turn train the staff (source: practicalsap.com). The organisation's key users must be involved in the implementation project and testing of the system. Many people within the TSO need all kinds of training. Some examples of these positions:\nBULLET::::- SAP Network Specialists\nBULLET::::- SAP Database Administrators\nBULLET::::- SAP Security specialists\nBULLET::::- Documentation specialists\nBULLET::::- Et cetera\nAll of these people need to acquire the required SAP knowledge and skills or even SAP certifications through training. Moreover, people need to learn to do business in a totally new way. To define how much SAP training every person needs, a company can make use of a skillset matrix. With this matrix, a manager can identify who possesses what knowledge, to manage and plan training, by defining the height of expertise with a number between e.g. 1 and 4 for each skill for each employee.\nSetup SAP data center\nThe next step is to set up the SAP data center. This means either building a new data center facility or transforming the current data center into a foundation capable of supporting the SAP solution stack, i.e. all of the technology layers and components (SAP software products) in a productive SAP installation. The most important factor when designing the data center is availability. The high availability and disaster recovery requirements which should have been defined earlier, give a good idea of the required data center requirements to host the SAP software. Data center requirements can be a:\nBULLET::::- Physical requirement like power requirements\nBULLET::::- Rack requirement\nBULLET::::- Network infrastructure requirement or\nBULLET::::- Requirement to the network server.\nPerform installations\nThe following step is to install the required SAP software parts which are called components and technological foundations like a web application server or enterprise portals, to a state ready for business process configuration. The most vital sub steps are to prepare your OS, prepare the database server and then start installing SAP software. Here it is important to use installation guides, which are published for each SAP component or technology solution by SAP SE. Examples of SAP components are:\nBULLET::::- R/3 Enterprise \u2014 Transaction Processing\nBULLET::::- mySAP BI \u2014 Business Information Warehouse\nBULLET::::- mySAP CRM \u2014 Customer Relationship Management\nBULLET::::- mySAP KW \u2014 Knowledge Warehouse\nBULLET::::- mySAP PLM \u2014 Product Lifecycle Management\nBULLET::::- mySAP SCM \u2014 Supply Chain Management\nBULLET::::- mySAP SEM \u2014 Strategic Enterprise Management\nBULLET::::- mySAP SRM \u2014 Supplier Relationship Management\nBULLET::::- mySAP HCM \u2014 Human Capital Management\nRound out support for SAP\nBefore moving into the functional development phase, the organization should identify and staff the remaining TSO roles, e.g. roles that relate to helpdesk work and other such support providing work.\nAddress change management\nThe next challenge for an organization is all about change management / change control, which means to develop a planned approach to the changes the organization faces. The objective here is to maximize the collective efforts of all people involved in the change and to minimize the risk of failure of implementing the changes related to the SAP implementation."], "wikipedia-7071096": ["The engineering design process is a methodical series of steps that engineers use in creating functional products and processes. The process is highly iterative - parts of the process often need to be repeated many times before another can be entered - though the part(s) that get iterated and the number of such cycles in any given project may vary.\n\nOne framing of the engineering design process delineates the following stages: \"research, conceptualization, feasibility assessment, establishing design requirements, preliminary design, detailed design, production planning and tool design, and production\".\n\nResearch: Various stages of the design process (and even earlier) can involve a significant amount of time spent on locating information and research. Consideration should be given to the existing applicable literature, problems and successes associated with existing solutions, costs, and marketplace needs.\nThe source of information should be relevant, including existing solutions. Reverse engineering can be an effective technique if other solutions are available on the market. Other sources of information include the Internet, local libraries, available government documents, personal organizations, trade journals, vendor catalogs and individual experts available.\n\nDesign requirements: Establishing design requirements and conducting requirement analysis, sometimes termed problem definition (or deemed a related activity), is one of the most important elements in the design process, and this task is often performed at the same time as a feasibility analysis. The design requirements control the design of the product or process being developed, throughout the engineering design process. These include basic things like the functions, attributes, and specifications - determined after assessing user needs. Some design requirements include hardware and software parameters, maintainability, availability, and testability.\n\nFeasibility: In some cases, a feasibility study is carried out after which schedules, resource plans and estimates for the next phase are developed. The feasibility study is an evaluation and analysis of the potential of a proposed project to support the process of decision making. It outlines and analyses alternatives or methods of achieving the desired outcome. The feasibility study helps to narrow the scope of the project to identify the best scenario.\nA feasibility report is generated following which Post Feasibility Review is performed.\nThe purpose of a feasibility assessment is to determine whether the engineer's project can proceed into the design phase. This is based on two criteria: the project needs to be based on an achievable idea, and it needs to be within cost constraints. It is important to have engineers with experience and good judgment to be involved in this portion of the feasibility study.\n\nConceptualization: A concept study (conceptualization, conceptual design) is often a phase of project planning that includes producing ideas and taking into account the pros and cons of implementing those ideas. This stage of a project is done to minimize the likelihood of error, manage costs, assess risks, and evaluate the potential success of the intended project. In any event, once an engineering issue or problem is defined, potential solutions must be identified. These solutions can be found by using ideation, the mental process by which ideas are generated. In fact, this step is often termed Ideation or \"Concept Generation.\" The following are widely used techniques:\n- trigger word - a word or phrase associated with the issue at hand is stated, and subsequent words and phrases are evoked.\n- morphological analysis - independent design characteristics are listed in a chart, and different engineering solutions are proposed for each solution. Normally, a preliminary sketch and short report accompany the morphological chart.\n- synectics - the engineer imagines him or herself as the item and asks, \"What would I do if I were the system?\" This unconventional method of thinking may find a solution to the problem at hand. The vital aspects of the conceptualization step is synthesis. Synthesis is the process of taking the element of the concept and arranging them in the proper way. Synthesis creative process is present in every design.\n- brainstorming - this popular method involves thinking of different ideas, typically as part of a small group, and adopting these ideas in some form as a solution to the problem\nVarious generated ideas must then undergo a concept evaluation step, which utilizes various tools to compare and contrast the relative strengths and weakness of possible alternatives."], "wikipedia-25346749": ["Cooper devised a method of moving from an ethical problem to appropriate alternatives and consequences.

Community public forums\nBULLET::::5. Producing a final report and planning action committees\nSelecting members of a focus group first requires choosing a target community, population, or demographic which will structure the community needs assessment. This information guides the selection process for a focus group. The principle of the focus group is to select members who are diverse yet share a degree of commonality. This may sound paradoxical yet it isn't necessarily. Generally speaking the commonality between focus group members is a vested interest and stake in their community. Thus, focus group members might include: \"local politicians, business owners, block club leaders and community activists. Another focus group would consist of adult resident of the community; and a third consisting of youth residents of the community\".\nFocus groups solicit input from community members on broad, open-ended questions, such as:\nBULLET::::- What do you like about your community?\nBULLET::::- What concerns you within your community?\nBULLET::::- How would you improve your community?\nBULLET::::- What changes do you foresee/fear/want to see in your community within the next 10 years?\nQuestions such as these can help target potential strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and needs for change or growth.\nWith the targeted objectives discovered in the focus group, the community needs assessment survey can be created and dispersed.\nLeaders of the community needs assessment can then summarize the data through computer analysis programs such as Access or SPSS. The results are then brought to the community through a public forum.\nPublic forums are the place where the information collected through the survey, the identified strengths, weaknesses, and concerns of the community are presented for open public discussion.\nFinally, the results of the focus groups, survey, and public forum present a direction which the final report can detail. Action groups are formed and solutions and guidelines are enacted to ensure the changes desire are realized."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

When the probability is 80 (Figure 2d), data chunks are quickly cached at the closest hop to the client. Probability 50 makes the process much slower. Even when most chunks are cached one hop away, it still takes another six probing rounds to cache all chunks at the 2nd-hop router (Figure 2e). Prob-20 is the worst one in terms of the time to cache all chunks at the 2nd-hop router (Figure 2f). After ten rounds, some chunks are still not cached at the closest router.

CEE, LCD, and Label-caching stand out for their distinct Violin Plot shapes. CEE caches everything everywhere. LCD always caches Data chunks at the next hop from the node where the cache hit occurred. When Lable-caching is in use, an NDN router only caches Data chunks whose IDs modulo k are equal to the assigned label l. It is obvious that both CEE and LCD deterministically save all Data chunks at a specific hop. The difference is the hop counts for each round. CEE starts to serve requests with the local copy since the second round. In Figure 2a, these chunks stay at the 2nd-hop for the rest of the rounds as the 2nd-hop router is the closest node equipped with CS. When LCD is using, the hop count for one round is always one hop closer to the client, until it arrives at the 2nd-hop router (Figure 2b). Lable-caching, however, caches chunks on multiple routers. This caching mechanism consistently keep chunks at specific hops. Duplicate Interests do not change the caching state. Figure 2c shows that all the rounds produce the same violin shape. Static probabilistic caching is the easiest way to achieve higher cache diversity without increasing the complexity. Figure 2 shows the profile of static probabilistic caching decisions with probability 20, 50, and 80, respectively, dubbed as Prob-20, Prob-50, and Prob-80. Comparing with CEE and LCD, a major difference is that cached chunks have various hop count within one round when static prob-abolic caching decisions are in use.

To figure out the hop count of a chunk, the client needs to send out an Interest that starts with HopLimit one. If no data is received, it increments the HopLimit value to two and sends out the same interest until a data packet comes back. This approach has two issues. First, the client must send Interests to cover all hops until an Interest reaches the router that contains the data chunk. Most Interests are wasted without any Data chunks returned. These Interests introduce overhead not only into the bandwidth but also the PIT. Second, the measurement with HopLimit will be time-consuming. Interest has to wait until it times out when no Data comes back. No better way to speed up the measurement process without affecting the caching states.

NDN has its roots in an earlier project, Content-Centric Networking (CCN), which Van Jacobson first publicly presented in 2006. The NDN project is investigating Jacobson's proposed evolution from today's host-centric network architecture IP to a data-centric network architecture (NDN). The belief is that this conceptually simple shift will have far-reaching implications for how people design, develop, deploy, and use networks and applications. Its premise is that the Internet is primarily used as an information distribution network, which is not a good match for IP, and that the future Internet's \"thin waist\" should be based on named data rather than numerically addressed hosts. The underlying principle is that a communication network should allow a user to focus on the data he or she needs, named \"content\", rather than having to reference a specific, physical location where that data is to be retrieved from, named \"hosts\". The motivation for this is derived from the fact that the vast majority of current Internet usage (a \"high 90% level of traffic\") consists of data being disseminated from a source to a number of users. Named-data networking comes with potential for a wide range of benefits such as content caching to reduce congestion and improve delivery speed, simpler configuration of network devices, and building security into the network at the data level.\n\nNDN changes the semantics of network service from delivering the packet to a given destination address to fetching data identified by a given name. The name in an NDN packet can name anything \u2013 an endpoint, a data chunk in a movie or a book, a command to turn on some lights, etc. The hope is that this conceptually simple change allows NDN networks to apply almost all of the Internet's well-tested engineering properties to a broader range of problems beyond end-to-end communications.\n\nCommunication in NDN is driven by receivers i.e., data consumers, through the exchange of two types of packets: Interest and Data. Both types of packets carry a name that identifies a piece of data that can be transmitted in one Data packet.\nPacket Types\nBULLET::::- Interest: A consumer puts the name of a desired piece of data into an Interest packet and sends it to the network. Routers use this name to forward the Interest toward the data producer(s).\nBULLET::::- Data: Once the Interest reaches a node that has the requested data, the node will return a Data packet that contains both the name and the content, together with a signature by the producer's key which binds the two. This Data packet follows in reverse the path taken by the Interest to get back to the requesting consumer.\n\nTo carry out the Interest and Data packet forwarding functions, each NDN router maintains three data structures, and a forwarding policy:\nBULLET::::- Pending Interest Table (PIT): stores all the Interests that a router has forwarded but not satisfied yet. Each PIT entry records the data name carried in the Interest, together with its incoming and outgoing interface(s).\nBULLET::::- Forwarding Information Base (FIB): a routing table which maps name components to interfaces. The FIB itself is populated by a name-prefix based routing protocol, and can have multiple output interfaces for each prefix.\nBULLET::::- Content Store (CS): a temporary cache of Data packets the router has received. Because an NDN Data packet is meaningful independent of where it comes from or where it is forwarded, it can be cached to satisfy future Interests. Replacement strategy is traditionally least recently used, but the replacement strategy is determined by the router and may differ.\nBULLET::::- Forwarding Strategies: a series of policies and rules about forwarding interest and data packets. Note that the Forwarding Strategy may decide to drop an Interest in certain situations, e.g., if all upstream links are congested or the Interest is suspected to be part of a DoS attack. These strategies use a series of triggers in the forwarding pipeline and are assigned to name prefixes."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

In this paper, we focus on detecting the caching decision algorithms. As the background to understanding our results, this section presents the different caching decision algorithms that have been implemented in NDN networks. We conclude this section with a brief discussion of cache replacement, though we do not measure it in our study.\n3.1 Caching Decision\nThe caching decision is to determine whether a packet will be stored in the CS or discarded. Typically, an NDN node needs to make such a decision when a Data packet arrives at an NDN node that does not have the packet in its CS.\n3.1.1 Cache Everything Everywhere (CEE). CEE is the most straightforward caching decision strategy. With CEE as the strategy, NDN nodes attempt to cache every incoming Data packet that is not already in their CS. Caching Data packets everywhere provides the rapid replication of all available Data packets through the network. Due to its simplicity, the CEE strategy is widely used in NDN networks.\nCEE leads to high redundancy, especially in a strongly connected network [13]. This redundancy can hurt the overall caching efficiency of a network. In a network with severely limited caching capabilities, CEE is likely to waste precious caching resources.\nCaching efficiency can be measured using diversity [13], which is the ratio of unique content objects in all caches to unique content producers. Other advanced caching strategies attempt to maximize this metric by ensuring different router saves different Data packets.\n3.1.2 Leave Copy Down (LCD).

NDN has its roots in an earlier project, Content-Centric Networking (CCN), which Van Jacobson first publicly presented in 2006. The NDN project is investigating Jacobson's proposed evolution from today's host-centric network architecture IP to a data-centric network architecture (NDN). The belief is that this conceptually simple shift will have far-reaching implications for how people design, develop, deploy, and use networks and applications.\nIts premise is that the Internet is primarily used as an information distribution network, which is not a good match for IP, and that the future Internet's \"thin waist\" should be based on named data rather than numerically addressed hosts. The underlying principle is that a communication network should allow a user to focus on the data he or she needs, named \"content\", rather than having to reference a specific, physical location where that data is to be retrieved from, named \"hosts\". The motivation for this is derived from the fact that the vast majority of current Internet usage (a \"high 90% level of traffic\") consists of data being disseminated from a source to a number of users. Named-data networking comes with potential for a wide range of benefits such as content caching to reduce congestion and improve delivery speed, simpler configuration of network devices, and building security into the network at the data level.\nSection::::Overview.\nToday's Internet's hourglass architecture centers on a universal network layer, IP, which implements the minimal functionality necessary for global inter-connectivity. The contemporary Internet architecture revolves around a host-based conversation model, created in the 1970s to allow geographically distributed users to use a few big, immobile computers. This thin waist enabled the Internet's explosive growth by allowing both lower and upper layer technologies to innovate independently. However, IP was designed to create a communication network, where packets named only communication endpoints.\nSustained growth in e-commerce, digital media, social networking, and smartphone applications has led to dominant use of the Internet as a distribution network. Distribution networks are more general than communication networks, and solving distribution problems via a point-to-point communication protocol is complex and error-prone.\nThe Named Data Networking (NDN) project proposed an evolution of the IP architecture that generalizes the role of this thin waist, such that packets can name objects other than communication endpoints. More specifically, NDN changes the semantics of network service from delivering the packet to a given destination address to fetching data identified by a given name. The name in an NDN packet can name anything \u2013 an endpoint, a data chunk in a movie or a book, a command to turn on some lights, etc. The hope is that this conceptually simple change allows NDN networks to apply almost all of the Internet's well-tested engineering properties to a broader range of problems beyond end-to-end communications. Examples of NDN applying lessons learned from 30 years of networking engineering are that self-regulation of network traffic (via flow balance between Interest (data request) and Data packets) and security primitives (via signatures on all named data) are integrated into the protocol from the start."], "wikipedia-58038703": ["In computing, cache algorithms (also frequently called cache replacement algorithms or cache replacement policies) are optimizing instructionsor algorithmsthat a computer program or a hardware-maintained structure can follow in order to manage a cache of information stored on the computer. When the cache is full, the algorithm must choose which items to discard to make room for the new ones. Due to the inherent caching capability of nodes in Information-centric networking ICN, the ICN can be viewed as a loosely connect network of caches, which has unique requirements of Caching policies. Unlike proxy servers, in Information-centric networking the cache is a network level solution. Therefore, it has rapidly changing cache states and higher request arrival rates; moreover, smaller cache sizes further impose different kind of requirements on the content eviction policies. In particular, eviction policies for Information-centric networking should be fast and lightweight. Various cache replication and eviction schemes for different Information-centric networking architectures and applications are proposed."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

In this paper, we focus on detecting the caching decision algorithms. As the background to understanding our results, this section presents the different caching decision algorithms that have been implemented in NDN networks. We conclude this section with a brief discussion of cache replacement, though we do not measure it in our study.\n3.1 Caching Decision\nThe caching decision is to determine whether a packet will be stored in the CS or discarded. Typically, an NDN node needs to make such a decision when a Data packet arrives at an NDN node that does not have the packet in its CS.\n3.1.1 Cache Everything Everywhere (CEE). CEE is the most straightforward caching decision strategy. With CEE as the strategy, NDN nodes attempt to cache every incoming Data packet that is not already in their CS. Caching Data packets everywhere provides the rapid replication of all available Data packets through the network. Due to its simplicity, the CEE strategy is widely used in NDN networks.\nCEE leads to high redundancy, especially in a strongly connected network [13]. This redundancy can hurt the overall caching efficiency of a network. In a network with severely limited caching capabilities, CEE is likely to waste precious caching resources.\nCaching efficiency can be measured using diversity [13], which is the ratio of unique content objects in all caches to unique content producers. Other advanced caching strategies attempt to maximize this metric by ensuring different router saves different Data packets.\n3.1.2 Leave Copy Down (LCD). NDN networks with the LCD caching policy always cache Data packets only at the first node to receive the Data [14]. The 'first node' is the next hop from the node where the cache hit occurred towards the consumer.\nLCD is chosen when the network wants to improve the caching diversity without introducing complex communication into the caching process.

Due to this complexity, only a few tools are currently available in NDN measurements.

Furthermore, experiments suggest that different caching approaches may better serve different applications. A number of different NDN caching policies have been developed (see section 3). Since a caching policy can be applied to a specific name prefix, ISPs have the potential to provide differentiated caching services or other novel caching-related content services.

Clearly, you would like to know how the network\u2019s routers are caching the content. The knowledge could help content creators verify their caching agreement with ISPs.

Due to this complexity, only a few tools are currently available in NDN measurements.

NDN can be seen as a superset of IP. NDN could name data in various ways where the IP address is one feasible format. Therefore, NDN needs measurement tools/methods to cover more aspects than IP.\nTo the best of our knowledge, NDN has a few measurement tools [2, 7, 11, 22] that cover some aspects.

The HopLimit is an Interest field to limit the number of hops the Interest is allowed to be forwarded [21]. To figure out the hop count of a chunk, the client needs to send out an Interest that starts with HopLimit one. If no data is received, it increments the HopLimit value to two and sends out the same interest until a data packet comes back. This approach has two issues. First, the client must send Interests to cover all hops until an Interest reaches the router that contains the data chunk. Most Interests are wasted without any Data chunks returned. These Interests introduce overhead not only into the bandwidth but also the PIT. Second, the measurement with HopLimit will be time-consuming. Interest has to wait until it times out when no Data comes back. No better way to speed up the measurement process without affecting the caching states. To this end, we use measured RTT at the client as the indicator of hops. When RTT does not work, we apply k-means [10] to estimate hop counts for chunks.

The HopLimit is an Interest field to limit the number of hops the Interest is allowed to be forwarded [21]. To figure out the hop count of a chunk, the client needs to send out an Interest that starts with HopLimit one. If no data is received, it increments the HopLimit value to two and sends out the same interest until a data packet comes back. This approach has two issues. First, the client must send Interests to cover all hops until an Interest reaches the router that contains the data chunk. Most Interests are wasted without any Data chunks returned. These Interests introduce overhead not only into the bandwidth but also the PIT. Second, the measurement with HopLimit will be time-consuming. Interest has to wait until it times out when no Data comes back. No better way to speed up the measurement process without affecting the caching states.

This allows each application to choose the naming scheme that fits its needs, and naming can thus evolve independently from the network.\nSection::::Names.:Structure.\nThe NDN design assumes hierarchically structured names, e.g., a video produced by UCLA may have the name /ucla/videos/demo.mpg, where \u2018/\u2019 delineates name components in text representations, similar to URLs. This hierarchical structure has many potential benefits:\nBULLET::::- Relationship specification: allows applications to represent the context and relationships of data elements. EX: segment 3 of version 1 of a UCLA demo video might be named /ucla/videos/demo.mpg/1/3.\nBULLET::::- Name aggregation: /ucla could correspond to an autonomous system originating the video\nBULLET::::- Routing: allows the system to scale and aids in providing the necessary context for the data\nSection::::Names.:Specifying a Name.\nTo retrieve dynamically generated data, consumers must be able to deterministically construct the name for a desired piece of data without having previously seen the name or the data through either:\nBULLET::::- an algorithm allows the producer and consumer to arrive at the same name based on information available to both\nBULLET::::- Interest selectors in conjunction with longest prefix matching retrieve the desired data through one or more iterations.\nCurrent research is exploring how applications should choose names that can facilitate both application development and network delivery. The aim of this work is to develop and refine existing principles and guidelines for naming, converting these rules into naming conventions implemented in system libraries to simplify future application development.\nSection::::Names.:Namespaces.\nData that may be retrieved globally must have globally unique names, but names used for local communications may require only local routing (or local broadcast) to find matching data. Individual data names can be meaningful in various scopes and contexts, ranging from \u201cthe light switch in this room\u201d to \u201call country names in the world\u201d.\nNamespace management is not part of the NDN architecture, just as address space management is not part of the IP architecture. However naming is the most important part of NDN application designs. \nEnabling application developers, and sometimes users, to design their own namespaces for data exchange has several benefits:\nBULLET::::- increasing the closeness of mapping between an application's data and its use of the network\nBULLET::::- reducing the need for secondary notation (record-keeping to map application configuration to network configuration)\nBULLET::::- expanding the range of abstractions available to the developers.\nSection::::Routing.\nSection::::Routing.:Solutions to IP Issues.\nNDN routes and forwards packets based on names, which eliminates three problems caused by addresses in the IP architecture:\nBULLET::::- Address space exhaustion: NDN namespace is essentially unbounded. The namespace is only bounded by the max interest packet size of 8kb and the number of possible unique combinations of characters composing names.\nBULLET::::- NAT traversal: NDN does away with addresses, public or private, so NAT is unnecessary.\nBULLET::::- Address management: address assignment and management is no longer required in local networks.\nBULLET::::- In network multicasting: A producer of data does not need to receive multiple interests for the same data since the PIT entries at downstream forwarders will aggregate interests. The producer receives and responds to a single interest and those forwarding nodes in which multiple incoming interest were received will multicast the data replies to the interfaces those interests were received from.\nBULLET::::- High loss end to end reliability: IP based networks require lost or dropped packets to be retransmitted by the sender. However, in NDN if an interest expires before a data reply reaches the requester the data reply is still cached by forwarders along the return path. The retransmitted interest only needs to reach a forwarder with a cached copy of the data giving NDN based networks higher throughput than IP based networks when packet loss rates are high.\nSection::::Routing.:Protocols.\nNDN can use conventional routing algorithms such as link state and distance vector. Instead of announcing IP prefixes, an NDN router announces name prefixes that cover the data the router is willing to serve. Conventional routing protocols, such as OSPF and BGP, can be adapted to route on name prefixes by treating names as a sequence of opaque components and doing component-wise longest prefix match of a name in an Interest packet against the FIB table. This enables a wide array of inputs to be aggregated in real time and distributed across multiple interface environments simultaneously without compromising content encryption."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

It is obvious that both CEE and LCD deterministically save all Data chunks at a specific hop. The difference is the hop counts for each round. CEE starts to serve requests with the local copy since the second round. In Figure 2a, these chunks stay at the 2nd-hop for the rest of the rounds as the 2nd-hop router is the closest node equipped with CS. When LCD is using, the hop count for one round is always one hop closer to the client, until it arrives at the 2nd-hop router (Figure 2b). Lable-caching, however, caches chunks on multiple routers.

CEE, LCD, and Label-caching stand out for their distinct Violin Plot shapes. CEE caches everything everywhere. LCD always caches Data chunks at the next hop from the node where the cache hit occurred. When Lable-caching is in use, an NDN router only caches Data chunks whose IDs modulo k are equal to the assigned label l. It is obvious that both CEE and LCD deterministically save all Data chunks at a specific hop. The difference is the hop counts for each round. CEE starts to serve requests with the local copy since the second round. In Figure 2a, these chunks stay at the 2nd-hop for the rest of the rounds as the 2nd-hop router is the closest node equipped with CS. When LCD is using, the hop count for one round is always one hop closer to the client, until it arrives at the 2nd-hop router (Figure 2b). Lable-caching, however, caches chunks on multiple routers. This caching mechanism consistently keep chunks at specific hops. Duplicate Interests do not change the caching state. Figure 2c shows that all the rounds produce the same violin shape. Static probabilistic caching is the easiest way to achieve higher cache diversity without increasing the complexity. Figure 2 shows the profile of static probabilistic caching decisions with probability 20, 50, and 80, respectively, dubbed as Prob-20, Prob-50, and Prob-80. Comparing with CEE and LCD, a major difference is that cached chunks have various hop count within one round when static prob-abolic caching decisions are in use.

The second round has the tallest violin shape in a specific static probabilistic caching. With subsequent rounds, the violin shapes become progressively shorter. Duplicate Interests let chunks go through the downstream routers, and they have a higher chance of being cached. The change of violin shape between rounds also represents the static probability. When the probability is 80 (Figure 2d), data chunks are quickly cached at the closest hop to the client. Probability 50 makes the process much slower. Even when most chunks are cached one hop away, it still takes another six probing rounds to cache all chunks at the 2nd-hop router (Figure 2e). Prob-20 is the worst one in terms of the time to cache all chunks at the 2nd-hop router (Figure 2f). After ten rounds, some chunks are still not cached at the closest router.

It is obvious that both CEE and LCD deterministically save all Data chunks at a specific hop. The difference is the hop counts for each round.

It is usually assumed that these algorithms converge faster with a greater exchange of information (i.e., by increased network connectivity) in every iteration. However, when interference is taken into account, it is no longer clear if the rate of convergence increases with network connectivity. We study this problem for randomly-placed consensus-seeking nodes connected through an interference-limited network. We investigate the following questions: (a) How does the rate of convergence vary with increasing communication range of each node? and (b) How does this result change when each node is allowed to communicate with a few selected far-off nodes? When nodes schedule their transmissions to avoid interference, we show that the convergence speed scales with $r^{2-d}$, where $r$ is the communication range and $d$ is the number of dimensions. This scaling is the result of two competing effects when increasing $r$: Increased schedule length for interference-free transmission vs. the speed gain due to improved connectivity.

In this paper, we focus on detecting the caching decision algorithms. As the background to understanding our results, this section presents the different caching decision algorithms that have been implemented in NDN networks. We conclude this section with a brief discussion of cache replacement, though we do not measure it in our study.\n3.1 Caching Decision\nThe caching decision is to determine whether a packet will be stored in the CS or discarded. Typically, an NDN node needs to make such a decision when a Data packet arrives at an NDN node that does not have the packet in its CS.\n3.1.1 Cache Everything Everywhere (CEE). CEE is the most straightforward caching decision strategy. With CEE as the strategy, NDN nodes attempt to cache every incoming Data packet that is not already in their CS. Caching Data packets everywhere provides the rapid replication of all available Data packets through the network. Due to its simplicity, the CEE strategy is widely used in NDN networks.\nCEE leads to high redundancy, especially in a strongly connected network [13]. This redundancy can hurt the overall caching efficiency of a network. In a network with severely limited caching capabilities, CEE is likely to waste precious caching resources.\nCaching efficiency can be measured using diversity [13], which is the ratio of unique content objects in all caches to unique content producers. Other advanced caching strategies attempt to maximize this metric by ensuring different router saves different Data packets.\n3.1.2 Leave Copy Down (LCD). NDN networks with the LCD caching policy always cache Data packets only at the first node to receive the Data [14]. The 'first node' is the next hop from the node where the cache hit occurred towards the consumer.\nLCD is chosen when the network wants to improve the caching diversity without introducing complex communication into the caching process.

As a consequence, the valleys separating such peaks are shallow and narrow, such that evolutionary trajectories towards the highest peak in the landscape can be achieved via a series of valley crossings"], "arxiv-cond-mat/9802234": ["We argue that the sharp peak structure reflects an endogenous inter-market organization, and that peaks may be seen as local ``singularities'' resulting from imitation and herding."]}, "paper/37": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The aim of traffic modeling is to find stochastic processes to represent the behavior of traffic. Working at the Copenhagen Telephone Company in the 1910s, A. K. Erlang famously characterized telephone traffic at the call level by certain probability distributions for arrivals of new calls and their holding times. Erlang applied the traffic models to estimate the telephone switch capacity needed to achieve a given call blocking probability. The Erlang blocking formulas had tremendous practical interest for public carriers because telephone facilities (switching and transmission) involved considerable investments. Over several decades, Erlang\u2019s work stimulated the use of queuing theory, and applied probability in general, to engineer the public switched telephone network. Teletraffic theory for packet networks has seen considerable progress in recent decades. Significant advances have been made in long-range dependence, wavelet, and multifractal approaches. At the same time, traffic modeling continues to be challenged by evolving network technologies and new multimedia applications. For example, wireless technologies allow greater mobility of users. Mobility must be an additional consideration for modeling traffic in wireless networks. Traffic modeling is an ongoing process without a real end. Traffic models represent our best current understanding of traffic behavior, but our understanding will change and grow over time.\u201d\n\nSection::::Network traffic models usage.\nMeasurements are useful and necessary for verifying the actual network performance. However, measurements do not have the level of abstraction that makes traffic models useful. Traffic models can be used for hypothetical problem solving whereas traffic measurements only reflect current reality. In probabilistic terms, a traffic trace is a realization of a random process, whereas a traffic model is a random process. Thus, traffic models have universality. A traffic trace gives insight about a particular traffic source, but a traffic model gives insight about all traffic sources of that type. Traffic models have three major uses. One important use of traffic models is to properly dimension network resources for a target level of QoS. It was mentioned earlier that Erlang developed models of voice calls to estimate telephone switch capacity to achieve a target call blocking probability. Similarly, models of packet traffic are needed to estimate the bandwidth and buffer resources to provide acceptable packet delays and packet loss probability. Knowledge of the average traffic rate is not sufficient. It is known from queuing theory that queue lengths increase with the variability of traffic. Hence, an understanding of traffic burstiness or variability is needed to determine sufficient buffer sizes at nodes and link capacities. A second important use of traffic models is to verify network performance under specific traffic controls. For example, given a packet scheduling algorithm, it would be possible to evaluate the network performance resulting from different traffic scenarios. For another example, a popular area of research is new improvements to the TCP congestion avoidance algorithm. It is critical that any algorithm is stable and allows multiple hosts to share bandwidth fairly, while sustaining a high throughput. Effective evaluation of the stability, fairness, and throughput of new algorithms would not be possible without realistic source models. A third important use of traffic models is admission control. In particular, connection oriented networks such as ATM depends on admission control to block new connections to maintain QOS guarantees. A simple admission strategy could be based on the peak rate of a new connection; a new connection is admitted if the available bandwidth is greater than the peak rate. However, that strategy would be overly conservative because a variable bit-rate connection may need significantly less bandwidth than its peak rate. A more sophisticated admission strategy is based on effective bandwidths. The source traffic behavior is translated into an effective bandwidth between the peak rate and average rate, which is the specific amount of bandwidth required to meet a given QoS constraint. The effective bandwidth depends on the variability of the source."], "wikipedia-1577103": ["Network traffic simulation usually follows the following four steps:\nBULLET::::- Modelling the system as a dynamic stochastic (i.e. random) process\nBULLET::::- Generation of the realizations of this stochastic process\nBULLET::::- Measurement of Simulation data\nBULLET::::- Analysis of output data\n\nThere are generally two kinds of simulations used to model telecommunications networks, viz. discrete and continuous simulations. Discrete simulations are also known as discrete event simulations, and are event-based dynamic stochastic systems. In other words, the system contains a number of states, and is modelled using a set of variables.

Also, in effect, the validity of \"post-test probability\" determined from likelihood ratio is not vulnerable to sampling bias in regard to those with and without the condition in the population sample, and can be done as a case-control study that separately gathers those with and without the condition.\nEstimation of post-test probability from pre-test probability and likelihood ratio goes as follows:\nBULLET::::- Pretest odds = (Pretest probability / (1 - Pretest probability)\nBULLET::::- Posttest odds = Pretest odds * Likelihood ratio\nIn equation above, \"positive post-test probability\" is calculated using the \"likelihood ratio positive\", and the \"negative post-test probability\" is calculated using the \"likelihood ratio negative\".\nBULLET::::- Posttest probability = Posttest odds / (Posttest odds + 1)\nThe relation can also be estimated by a so-called \"Fagan nomogram\" (shown at right) by making a straight line from the point of the given \"pre-test probability\" to the given \"likelihood ratio\" in their scales, which, in turn, estimates the \"post-test probability\" at the point where that straight line crosses its scale.\nThe post-test probability can, in turn, be used as pre-test probability for additional tests if it continues to be calculated in the same manner.\nIt is possible to do a calculation of likelihood ratios for tests with continuous values or more than two outcomes which is similar to the calculation for dichotomous outcomes. For this purpose, a separate likelihood ratio is calculated for every level of test result and is called interval or stratum specific likelihood ratios."], "wikipedia-140806": ["In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a distribution by maximizing a likelihood function, so that under the assumed statistical model the observed data is most probable. The point in the parameter space that maximizes the likelihood function is called the maximum likelihood estimate. The logic of maximum likelihood is both intuitive and flexible, and as such the method has become a dominant means of statistical inference.\nIf the likelihood function is differentiable, the derivative test for determining maxima can be applied. In some cases, the first-order conditions of the likelihood function can be solved explicitly; for instance, the ordinary least squares estimator maximizes the likelihood of the linear regression model. Under most circumstances, however, numerical methods will be necessary to find the maximum of the likelihood function.\nFrom the point of view of Bayesian inference, MLE is a special case of maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) that assumes a uniform prior distribution of the parameters. In frequentist inference, MLE is a special case of an extremum estimator, with the objective function being the likelihood.\nSection::::Principles.\nFrom a statistical standpoint, the observations formula_1 are a random sample from an unknown population. The goal is to make inferences about the population that is most likely to have generated the sample, specifically the probability distribution corresponding to the population. Associated with each probability distribution is a unique vector formula_2 of parameters that index the probability distribution within a parametric family formula_3. As formula_4 changes in value, different probability distributions are generated. The idea of maximum likelihood is to re-express the joint probability of the sample data formula_5 as a likelihood function formula_6 that treats formula_4 as a variable. For independent and identically distributed random variables, the likelihood function is defined as\nand evaluated at the observed data sample. The goal is then to find the values of the model parameter that maximize the likelihood function over the parameter space formula_9. Intuitively, this selects the parameter values that make the observed data most probable. The problem is thus to find the supremum value of the likelihood function by choice of the parameter\nwhere the estimator formula_11 is function of the sample. A sufficient but not necessary condition for its existence is for the likelihood function to be continuous over a parameter space formula_9 that is compact. For an open formula_9 the likelihood function may increase without ever reaching a supremum value.\nIn practice, it is often convenient to work with the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, called the log-likelihood:\nSince the logarithm is a monotonic function, the maximum of formula_15 occurs at the same value of formula_4 as does the maximum of formula_17. If formula_15 is differentiable in formula_4, the necessary conditions for the occurrence of a maximum (or a minimum) are\nknown as the likelihood equations. For some models, these equations can be explicitly solved for formula_21, but in general no closed-form solution to the maximization problem is known or available, and an MLE can only be found via numerical optimization. Another problem is that in finite samples, there may exist multiple roots for the likelihood equations. Whether the identified root formula_21 of the likelihood equations is indeed a (local) maximum depends on whether the matrix of second-order partial and cross-partial derivatives, \nknown as the Hessian matrix is negative semi-definite at formula_21, which indicates local concavity. Conveniently, most common probability distributions\u2014in particular the exponential family\u2014are logarithmically concave."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.
