For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. \nWe segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. camelCaseVariable, PascalCaseClass, UPPERCASE_CONSTANT). We thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words without a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\").\n\nTranslating short identifiers: Short variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\". We only translate identifiers which are at least two characters long.

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. We segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. camelCaseVariable, PascalCaseClass, UPPERCASE_CONSTANT). We thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words without a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\").\n\nVerb prior: The correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. In addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative.\n\nTranslating short identifiers: Short variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\".

We analyzed Java repositories on GitHub, the largest host of source code in the world, where 1.1 million unique users host 2.9 million public Java projects. We downloaded and analyzed the human language\nused for writing comments (in Java code), naming identifiers (method and variable names), and writing  \\textit{git commit} messages.\nWe focused on Java code as it is both one of the most popular source-code languages on GitHub and in the classroom.  \nA selection of results from this study are that:\nThis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first analysis of the human languages on GitHub. See Figure \\ref{fig:lang-stats} for an overview.\nUsers on GitHub do not state their L1 (arterial) language. While a subset of users optionally state their country this is neither common nor reliable. To estimate a user's preferred language we use the language that they use in the git commit message. To find subsets of users who speak a given language, we search for all users who write git commits in that language. We observe that, especially in personal projects, users write commit messages in their L1 language at a higher rate than comments or identifiers. To identify languages we use Google Language Detect which is highly accurate (more so for common internet languages) and can identify languages with non-Roman Alphabet text which has been transliterated, for example it can detect both\\begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{gbsn}\\hspace{-3mm}\u7b97\u6cd5\\end{CJK*} the Chinese characters for ``algorithm\" and \"suanfa\", the Mandarin transliteration, as Chinese\\footnote{Google Translate provides a confidence for its language detection. We only consider positive detections with confidence > 0.5. We don't run language detection on ascii strings less than 2 characters long. Identifiers are turned into phrases using  case parsing as described in section 3. All \"positive\" results are manually verified.}. \nOf the 1.1 million GitHub users, 12.7\\% wrote commit messages in non-English languages. Of the non-English languages Chinese was the most common (28.6\\% of non-English committers), followed by Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Japanese.  More than 100 languages were detected in commit messages on public Java projects. Figure \\ref{fig:lang-stats} contains breakdowns and the appendix contains the full list. This does not match the distribution of non-English in web content (55\\% English) with both major and minor languages underrepresented. For example the prevalence of Spanish on GitHub (2.1\\%) is about half of webcontent (5.1\\% \\cite{www-lang-trends}) and further trails native speakers (7.8\\% of the worlds population \\cite{spanish-speakers}).\nGithub does not present a random sample of programs written in the world, and we consider the relevant confounds this introduces. \nTo that point, we believe the under-representation of certain languages is a form of Survivorship Bias. It suggests that users have found barriers to entry towards joining the GitHub community. Those barriers could derive from the English dominance of programming languages, code instruction, or the github interface."], "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/4": ["Non-English code is a large-scale phenomena.\nNon-latin script users write comments in their L1 script but write identifiers in English.\nRight-to-left (RTL) language scripts, such as Arabic, have no observed prevalence on GitHub identifiers, implying that existing coders who speak RTL languages have substantial barriers in using their native script in code."], "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/14": ["In order to properly translate identifiers, we consider the following:\n\n\\textbf{Identifier segmentation:} Translating an identifier using a tool like Google Translate does not work by default as identifiers are often composed of unsegmented words. For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. \nWe segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. \\texttt{camelCaseVariable}, \\texttt{PascalCaseClass}, \\texttt{UPPERCASE\\_CONSTANT}).\nWe thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words \\emph{without} a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\"). \n\n\\textbf{Verb prior:}\nThe correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative. \n\n\\textbf{Translating short identifiers:}\nShort variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\".

Evaluating quality of a translation is hard without a large collection of native speakers and since we are powered by Google, evaluation can devolve into evaluating how accurate Google Translation is. Such an evaluation is a moving target: Google Translation is perennially improving.\nTo evaluate out translator we randomly selected 1,000 (1k) single file projects from public GitHub Java and translated them into the languages: Chinese, Spanish and Arabic. We measure (1) how often the translated code still compiles and (2) what percent of identifiers that we attempt to translate are translatable.\nOf the 1k projects 100\\% maintained their ability to be compiled regardless of whether we translated or transliterated the comments or identifiers. From the 1k projects 91\\% of the identifiers were able to be translated. The nine percent that were not able to be translated were mainly abbreviations (such as users who named a variable frac instead of fraction or pct instead of percent).

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. We segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. camelCaseVariable, PascalCaseClass, UPPERCASE_CONSTANT). We thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words without a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\"). \n\nThe correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \n\nShort variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\".

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. \nWe segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. camelCaseVariable, PascalCaseClass, UPPERCASE_CONSTANT).\nWe thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words without a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\").\n\nVerb prior:\nThe correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative.\n\nTranslating short identifiers:\nShort variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\".

This specification is not widely known, and even if Java supports non-ascii , there can be complexities of file encodings across different operating systems.\n \n \nWe find that regardless of L1 language most users transliterate identifiers: among L1 Chinese speakers, 93\\% of projects have identifiers which are only written in ASCII.

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. \nWe segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. camelCaseVariable, PascalCaseClass, UPPERCASE_CONSTANT).\nWe thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words without a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\"). \n\nVerb prior: The correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative. \n\nTranslating short identifiers: Short variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\". We only translate identifiers which are at least two characters long. This exception has its own edge-case: CJK (Chinese, Japanese Korean) identifiers can be  non-mathematical names even if only a character long."], "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/13": ["To adress this need, we designed a tool to help programmers, regardless of their spoken language, access code in many languages. The tool, which we call CodeInternational, takes in code written in either Java or Python with comments and identifiers written in a human-language and translates the comments and identifiers into another human-language. It supports the growing set of human languages covered by Google Translate and is adaptive to the particular context of source-code. To translate code, it first parses the code and extracts four types of tokens: Our translation algorithm is as follows. We (1) collect all of the target identifiers defined in the codebase and (2) translate them (enforcing that if two identifiers have the same name, they are given the same translation). Once the identifiers are translated we (3) translate the comments preserving structure and references to identifiers. (4) Finally string literals are optionally translated. See Figure \\ref{fig:api} for a highlevel depiction and Figure \\ref{fig:exampleTranslation} for a concrete example. Each of these steps has surprising challenges. In this section we cover the corresponding solutions we developed. The mapping of identifier translations that the tool decides on is preserved to assist any external source which needs to refer to the newly translated identifiers (such as text in a text-book or code in a related project). CodeInternational is implemented in Python. Tokenization is performed using a modified version of \"Javalang\" (for Java) and the \"Parser\" library (for Python).

The system's original creator, Franz Josef Och, has criticized the effectiveness of rule-based algorithms in favor of statistical approaches. It is based on a method called statistical machine translation, and more specifically, on research by Och who won the DARPA contest for speed machine translation in 2003. Och was the head of Google's machine translation group until leaving to join Human Longevity, Inc. in July 2014.\nAccording to Och, a solid base for developing a usable statistical machine translation system for a new pair of languages from scratch would consist of a bilingual text corpus (or parallel collection) of more than 150-200 million words, and two monolingual corpora each of more than a billion words. Statistical models from these data are then used to translate between those languages.\nTo acquire this huge amount of linguistic data, Google used United Nations and European Parliament transcripts.\nGoogle Translate does not translate from one language to another (L1 \u2192 L2). Instead, it often translates first to English and then to the target language (L1 \u2192 EN \u2192 L2).\nWhen Google Translate generates a translation, it looks for patterns in hundreds of millions of documents to help decide on the best translation. By detecting patterns in documents that have already been translated by human translators, Google Translate makes intelligent guesses as to what an appropriate translation should be.\nBefore October 2007, for languages other than Arabic, Chinese and Russian, Google Translate was based on SYSTRAN, a software engine which is still used by several other online translation services such as Babel Fish (now defunct). Since October 2007, Google Translate has used proprietary, in-house technology based on statistical machine translation instead.\nSection::::Method of translation.:Google Translate Community.\nGoogle constantly seeks for volunteers to be a part of its \u201cTranslate Community\u201d to translate languages people speak and help improve Google Translate's accuracy. There are two ways to contribute. First, Google will show a phrase then one should type in the translated version. Second, Google will show all possible translation for a phrase for individuals to click the right translation.\nSection::::Method of translation.:Statistical Machine Translation.\nAlthough, Google deployed a new system called \u201cNeural Machine Translation\u201d for better quality translation, there are languages that still use the traditional translation method called \u201cStatistical Machine Translation.\u201d It is a \u201crule-based\u201d translation method that utilizes predictive algorithms to guess ways to translate texts in foreign languages. It aims to translate whole phrases rather than single words then gather overlapping phrases for translation. Moreover, it also analyzes bilingual text corpora to generate statistical model that translates texts from one language to another.\nSection::::Method of translation.:Google Neural Machine Translation.\nIn September 2016, a research team at Google led by the software engineer Harold Gilchrist announced the development of the Google Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT) to increase fluency and accuracy in Google Translate and in November announced that Google Translate would switch to GNMT.\nGoogle Translate's neural machine translation system uses a large end-to-end artificial neural network capable of deep learning, in particular, long short-term memory networks.\nGNMT improves the quality of translation because it uses an example-based machine translation (EBMT) method in which the system \"learns from millions of examples.\" It translates \"whole sentences at a time, rather than just piece by piece. It uses this broader context to help it figure out the most relevant translation, which it then rearranges and adjusts to be more like a human speaking with proper grammar\". GNMT's \"proposed architecture\" of \"system learning\" was first tested on over a hundred languages supported by Google Translate. With the end-to-end framework, \"the system learns over time to create better, more natural translations.\" The GNMT network is capable of interlingual machine translation, which encodes the \"semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase-to-phrase translations\", and the system did not invent its own universal language, but uses \"the commonality found inbetween many languages\". GNMT was first enabled for eight languages: to and from English and Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Turkish. In March 2017, it was enabled for Hindi, Russian and Vietnamese languages, followed by Indonesian, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu languages in April.\nGNMT has the capability to translate directly from one language to another (L1 \u2192 L2), which improves upon the previous versions of Google Translate which first translated to English and then to the target language (L1 \u2192 EN \u2192 L2). The GNMT system is also capable of Zero-Shot Translation - translating between a language pair (for example, Japanese to Korean) which the \"system has never explicitly seen before.\"\nSection::::Method of translation.:Crowdsourcing.\nIn 2014, Google launched \"Translate Community\", a platform aimed at improving the translation service by seeking help from volunteers. In August 2016, a Google Crowdsource app was released for Android users, in which translation tasks are offered."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

Similarly, words with superordinate and subordinate relationships are confused.\nOverlapping semantics are difficult to distinguish, especially in translation. Words with multiple meanings (polysemous words) are mostly untranslatable, especially if they contain many connotations.\nConfusion of sense relations can also result because of semantic overlap. Confusion of sense relations in the set includes the improper use of superonym for hyponym, hyponym for superonym, a whole word for a partial word, a partial word for a whole word, antonym, confusion of co-hyponyms, and misuse of near-synonyms.\nAn example of semantic overlap found in a golf course:\n\"\"ANY PERSONS (EXCEPT PLAYERS) CAUGHT COLLECTING GOLF BALLS ON THIS COURSE WILL BE PROSECUTED AND HAVE THEIR BALLS REMOVED\"\" \nThe interlocutor's erroneous choice of word \"removed\" instead of \"confiscated\" results in accidental humor in the context as shown in the example above. Semantically, \"removed\" is a commonly used word to express the action \u2018take away\u2019 and both are related in terms of sense. \"Removed\" thus may be used as a superordinate form that includes the action of \"taking away\". The humorous aspect of this situation is intensified with the strong use of word \"removed\" in the phrase \"have their balls removed\", relates to the sexual innuendo of castration instead of the much less extreme action of confiscation. With the overlapping of semantics, the intended message is thus misinterpreted and accidental humor is resulted.\nOther examples:\nLexico-semantic clusterings can result in paradigmatic errors. It reflects the relations between related words and expressions, which is mainly of paradigmatic relations. The humor above is triggered by the translated text consisting of a script-switch trigger, which then results in the double reading. The irony is not lost in the contexts provided.\nIn machine translation from Chinese to English the phrase \"Fuck the certain price of goods\" has become proverbial for absurd machine mistranslations. That text was on a Chinese / English bilingual sign in a supermarket and should have read \"Dry goods department\".

Thus, it conveys the idea that they were only executed over the past two years, as a result, generating laughter among readers. In terms of the translator's intentions, the reference marker 'these' actually refers textually to the referent 'Arts' or, perhaps, 'the painters and sculptors' works' and not 'Soviet Republic painters and sculptors'. Hence, this script lacks of an eligible textual referent to accurately bring across the intended message. Although this script is easily decipherable based upon one's basic knowledge, it still did not fail to cause laughter and humor to readers.\nSection::::Translation error types and resultant humour.:Word order.\nWord order is the way in which syntactic constituents of a language arrange itself in a phrase or a sentence. Different languages employ different structures of word order. Direct translation of one language to another may result in wrong placement of a phrase in relation to the other constituents in the sentence. This may cause a change to the initial meaning of the translator and hence, may trigger a humorous script.\nBecause of to the incorrect placement of the adverbial phrase \u2018daily except Thursday\u2019 at the end of the sentence, this script generates unintentional humor in its translation. The adverbial phrase \u2018daily except Thursday\u2019 became a post-modifier which had misguided the readers into thinking that the script is about the act of burying \u2018famous Russian and Soviet composers, artists and writers\u2019, instead of conveying the act of people visiting the cemetery. Apparently, the translator wanted to avoid a possible awkwardness of phrasing the post-modifier after the appropriate act, but was unaware that the parentheses applied would also enclose another awkward and comical adverbial at the same time.\nLikewise, the humour in this case is also caused by the wrong placement of the prepositional phrase \u2018with nuts\u2019 as a post-modifier of \u2018the ladies\u2019 instead of its intended referent \u2018cocktails\u2019 as a post-modifier. Although the mishap is triggered by the mistaken word order, which can be changed to \"Special cocktails with nuts for the ladies\", it would still have remained as an awkward sentence because of the polysemous word \u2018nuts\u2019. Thus, if the word \u2018nuts\u2019 were to be replaced with \u2018cashews\u2019, any humorous translation error would not have been present.

However, if literally translated, the same phrase can mean \u2018many many few few\u2019, losing its original meaning and creating a ludicrous expression of meaning. A case of untranslatability is evident when Coca-Cola first entered the Chinese market in 1928. Initially there was no official representation of Coca Cola\u2019s name in Mandarin, and random phonetic translation of Coca Cola using random Chinese characters of similar phonetics were used, resulting in the name conveying ridiculous meanings like \"female horse fastened with wax\" or \"bite the wax tadpole\" when read. There was hence a need to find four Chinese characters with pronunciations and phonology approximated the sounds \"Coca Cola\" without producing a nonsensical or adverse meaning when combined into a written phrase. This brand blunder was eventually solved when the Chinese words \u53ef\u53e3\u53ef\u4e50 were used instead; meaning to be translated as \"to allow the mouth to be able to rejoice,\" but conceptually acceptable.\n\nHence the combination and translation of words expressed must conform to the target culture and literal language interpretation or it would result in hilarious misunderstandings. Prime examples of such errors comes in the form of poorly translated sign posts, notices and menus that fails to cater the intended meaning to both foreign and local speakers.\n\nTranslation errors have been used widely for commercial and entertainment purposes (intentional humour). A prominent example is the comedy video, \"Japanese Titanic\" by the YouTube comedy duo, Smosh. Garnering more than 8.5 million views to date, the farcical video script was produced by translating the original dialogue of the movie \"Titanic\" into Japanese dialogue via an online translator application, then translating the Japanese dialogue back into English.\n\nDifficulties with translation can arise from differences in word order, or from culture-bound expressions, and often also because of the inflexibility of machine translation. Also, it is due partly to the existence of multiple cultural, linguistic and semantic factors that machine translation often requires the aid of a human translator to convey the intended message of the source text.\n\nFor example, these are some funny translations done by machine translators:\nBULLET::::- In the office of a doctor in Rome: \"Specialist in women and other diseases\".\nBULLET::::- In a Japanese hotel: \"You are invited to take advantage of the chambermaid\".", "In machine translation from Chinese to English the phrase \"Fuck the certain price of goods\" has become proverbial for absurd machine mistranslations. That text was on a Chinese / English bilingual sign in a supermarket and should have read \"Dry goods department\". The Simplified Chinese character \u5e72 (link: \u5e72) can mean \"do\" and \"dry\" and \"fuck\".", "Japan's second-largest tourist agency was rather bewildered when it initially entered English markets and began receiving overwhelming requests for sexual tours. When they finally realized it, Kinki Nippon Tourist Company decided to change its name.\n\nThe examples from (1) to (7) illustrates the complete loss of the original meaning of the English words. Though the English pronounced sounds almost phonetically correct, the pronunciation is easily translatable to a Chinese lexeme of a depressing meaning (e.g. : \u2018All die\u2019). With the juxtaposition of the intended and accidental meaning with the cheerful pragmatics of the film, the translation becomes a hilariously erroneous one.\n\nIn examples (4-6, 8, 9), \u2018crap\u2019, \u2018shiting\u2019, \u2018porn\u2019, \u2018food\u2019, \u2018shit\u2019 were blatantly misspelled by the translators in a way that they all share the same phonological but a complete different semantics form of another already existing pejorative word in English; \u2018crab\u2019, \u2018shitting\u2019, \u2018pond\u2019, \u2018foot\u2019 and \u2018sheet\u2019 respectively. Thus, all these examples produce unexpected smutty farce-comedy for readers, where humour seeps in as a natural corollary of this linguistic coincidence. Innocuous as the spelling mistakes may seem, the examples above (1-3, 7, 10) were also misspelled to other words that have a total different meanings as the intended words. \u2018Dumping\u2019 means the act of removing waste or garbage and it was associated with a food - \u2018dumplings\u2019. Likewise, \u2018footwear\u2019, which is worn on your foot, is written as \u2018food-wear\u2019. Additionally, \u2018discount\u2019 is written as \u2018dis-cunt\u2019 whereby cunt is an obscene word. Lastly, \u2018tested\u2019 and \u2018tasted\u2019 have a complete distinct meanings. \u2018Tested\u2019 means to identify or characterize a substance or constituents whereas \u2018tasted\u2019 means to sense the flavor of something. Thus in the case of example 10, humour not only springs from the misspelled word \u2018tasted\u2019 but is also accidentally heightened by the existence of the phrase \u2018diagnostic for blood, urine, semain, stool and pregnancy\u2019, which creates a state of intolerable linguistic redundancy. Hence, in these ways, misspelling can give a tantalising feeling of amusement to readers.\n\n(1) A sign in a Chinese Safari Park states \"\u5927\u8c61\u5728\u6b64 \u8bf7\u7559\u5728\u8f66\u4e0a Elephants Here Please Stay In Your Car\"\nThe translator intended to refer the general public that are visiting the park as the implicit reference marker of the sign by using the co-referential anaphor 'Your', but failed to do so and instead, the explicit anaphor 'Your' unintentionally picks up 'Elephants' as the textual referent. Thus, this give rise to a humorous script that looks as though that the sign is meant for the elephants and not the people. In addition, this example highlights the importance of having punctuation to serve as a cohesion device because if the translator were to put a full stop or exclamation point after the word 'Elephants', the anaphor 'your' would have been interpreted literally for the readers. Therefore, it would have also ruled out any possibilities of humorous reading.", "Similarly, there is a mishap of the anaphoric reference marker 'these', which to the interpretation of readers, refers to 'Soviet Republic painters and sculptors'. Thus, it conveys the idea that they were only executed over the past two years, as a result, generating laughter among readers. In terms of the translator's intentions, the reference marker 'these' actually refers textually to the referent 'Arts' or, perhaps, 'the painters and sculptors' works' and not 'Soviet Republic painters and sculptors'.

Japan's second-largest tourist agency was rather bewildered when it initially entered English markets and began receiving overwhelming requests for sexual tours. When they finally realized it, Kinki Nippon Tourist Company decided to change its name.\nAn interesting and amusing example would be the pronunciation of English words with Chinese translatability by actor Xiao Xiao Bin in the 2010 comedy-martial arts film \"Just Call Me Nobody\":\nThe examples from (1) to (7) illustrates the complete loss of the original meaning of the English words. Though the English pronounced sounds almost phonetically correct, the pronunciation is easily translatable to a Chinese lexeme of a depressing meaning (e.g. : \u2018All die\u2019). With the juxtaposition of the intended and accidental meaning with the cheerful pragmatics of the film, the translation becomes a hilariously erroneous one.\nMisspelled words can be portrayed as the most basic level of inducing unintentional humor that occur in all translations, especially in signs or restaurants' menus. The ability to create humor out of misspelled words in translations happens particularly when the lexical items in a phrase or sentence are very well-known and common to English speakers but in a particular context, the lexical items appears to possess a totally different meaning that could be inappropriate at times.\nAll these examples clearly show how inadvertent spelling of words can give rise to humorous transcriptions to anyone who possess a fair flair of English. In examples (4-6, 8, 9), \u2018crap\u2019, \u2018shiting\u2019, \u2018porn\u2019, \u2018food\u2019, \u2018shit\u2019 were blatantly misspelled by the translators in a way that they all share the same phonological but a complete different semantics form of another already existing pejorative word in English; \u2018crab\u2019, \u2018shitting\u2019, \u2018pond\u2019, \u2018foot\u2019 and \u2018sheet\u2019 respectively. Thus, all these examples produce unexpected smutty farce-comedy for readers, where humour seeps in as a natural corollary of this linguistic coincidence. Innocuous as the spelling mistakes may seem, the examples above (1-3, 7, 10) were also misspelled to other words that have a total different meanings as the intended words. \u2018Dumping\u2019 means the act of removing waste or garbage and it was associated with a food - \u2018dumplings\u2019. Likewise, \u2018footwear\u2019, which is worn on your foot, is written as \u2018food-wear\u2019. Additionally, \u2018discount\u2019 is written as \u2018dis-cunt\u2019 whereby cunt is an obscene word. Lastly, \u2018tested\u2019 and \u2018tasted\u2019 have a complete distinct meanings. \u2018Tested\u2019 means to identify or characterize a substance or constituents whereas \u2018tasted\u2019 means to sense the flavor of something. Thus in the case of example 10, humour not only springs from the misspelled word \u2018tasted\u2019 but is also accidentally heightened by the existence of the phrase \u2018diagnostic for blood, urine, semain, stool and pregnancy\u2019, which creates a state of intolerable linguistic redundancy. Hence, in these ways, misspelling can give a tantalising feeling of amusement to readers.\nUsing the wrong reference may change the translator's intended meaning and led to multiple comical interpretations for the readers, thus, producing various humorous scripts. \nFor example,\n(1) A sign in a Chinese Safari Park states \"\u5927\u8c61\u5728\u6b64 \u8bf7\u7559\u5728\u8f66\u4e0a Elephants Here Please Stay In Your Car\"\nThe translator intended to refer the general public that are visiting the park as the implicit reference marker of the sign by using the co-referential anaphor 'Your', but failed to do so and instead, the explicit anaphor 'Your' unintentionally picks up 'Elephants' as the textual referent. Thus, this give rise to a humorous script that looks as though that the sign is meant for the elephants and not the people. In addition, this example highlights the importance of having punctuation to serve as a cohesion device because if the translator were to put a full stop or exclamation point after the word 'Elephants', the anaphor 'your' would have been interpreted literally for the readers. Therefore, it would have also ruled out any possibilities of humorous reading.\n(2) An article in Soviet Weekly reports \"There will be a Moscow Exhibition of Arts by 15,000 Soviet Republic painters and sculptors. These were executed over the past two years.\"\nSimilarly, there is a mishap of the anaphoric reference marker 'these', which to the interpretation of readers, refers to 'Soviet Republic painters and sculptors'. Thus, it conveys the idea that they were only executed over the past two years, as a result, generating laughter among readers. In terms of the translator's intentions, the reference marker 'these' actually refers textually to the referent 'Arts' or, perhaps, 'the painters and sculptors' works' and not 'Soviet Republic painters and sculptors'. Hence, this script lacks of an eligible textual referent to accurately bring across the intended message. Although this script is easily decipherable based upon one's basic knowledge, it still did not fail to cause laughter and humor to readers.\nWord order is the way in which syntactic constituents of a language arrange itself in a phrase or a sentence. Different languages employ different structures of word order. Direct translation of one language to another may result in wrong placement of a phrase in relation to the other constituents in the sentence. This may cause a change to the initial meaning of the translator and hence, may trigger a humorous script.\nBecause of to the incorrect placement of the adverbial phrase \u2018daily except Thursday\u2019 at the end of the sentence, this script generates unintentional humor in its translation. The adverbial phrase \u2018daily except Thursday\u2019 became a post-modifier which had misguided the readers into thinking that the script is about the act of burying \u2018famous Russian and Soviet composers, artists and writers\u2019, instead of conveying the act of people visiting the cemetery. Apparently, the translator wanted to avoid a possible awkwardness of phrasing the post-modifier after the appropriate act, but was unaware that the parentheses applied would also enclose another awkward and comical adverbial at the same time.\nLikewise, the humour in this case is also caused by the wrong placement of the prepositional phrase \u2018with nuts\u2019 as a post-modifier of \u2018the ladies\u2019 instead of its intended referent \u2018cocktails\u2019 as a post-modifier. Although the mishap is triggered by the mistaken word order, which can be changed to \"Special cocktails with nuts for the ladies\", it would still have remained as an awkward sentence because of the polysemous word \u2018nuts\u2019. Thus, if the word \u2018nuts\u2019 were to be replaced with \u2018cashews\u2019, any humorous translation error would not have been present. Therefore, it should be noted that attachment sites of prepositional phrases are a notorious source of ambiguity in English."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

Apparently, the translator wanted to avoid a possible awkwardness of phrasing the post-modifier after the appropriate act, but was unaware that the parentheses applied would also enclose another awkward and comical adverbial at the same time.\nLikewise, the humour in this case is also caused by the wrong placement of the prepositional phrase \u2018with nuts\u2019 as a post-modifier of \u2018the ladies\u2019 instead of its intended referent \u2018cocktails\u2019 as a post-modifier. Although the mishap is triggered by the mistaken word order, which can be changed to \"Special cocktails with nuts for the ladies\", it would still have remained as an awkward sentence because of the polysemous word \u2018nuts\u2019. Thus, if the word \u2018nuts\u2019 were to be replaced with \u2018cashews\u2019, any humorous translation error would not have been present. Therefore, it should be noted that attachment sites of prepositional phrases are a notorious source of ambiguity in English."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

What the term \"functional equivalence\" suggests is not just that the equivalence is between the function of the source text in the source culture and the function of the target text (translation) in the target culture, but that \"function\" can be thought of as a property of the text. It is possible to associate functional equivalence with \"how people interact in cultures\".\n\nBecause \"functional equivalence\" approach eschews strict adherence to the grammatical structure of the original text in favor of a more natural rendering in the target language, it is sometimes used when the readability of the translation is more important than the preservation of the original grammatical structure.\n\n\"Formal equivalence\" is often more goal than reality, if only because one language may contain a word for a concept which has no direct equivalent in another language. In such cases, a more dynamic translation may be used or a neologism may be created in the target language to represent the concept (sometimes by borrowing a word from the source language).\n\nThe more the source language differs from the target language, the more difficult it may be to understand a literal translation without modifying or rearranging the words in the target language. On the other hand, formal equivalence can allow readers familiar with the source language to analyze how meaning was expressed in the original text, preserving untranslated idioms, rhetorical devices (such as chiastic structures in the Hebrew Bible) and diction in order to preserve original information and highlight finer shades of meaning."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

We chose to only transliterate commands for RTL scripts."], "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/14": ["In order to properly translate identifiers, we consider the following:\n\nIdentifier segmentation: Translating an identifier using a tool like Google Translate does not work by default as identifiers are often composed of unsegmented words. For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. We segment identifiers using naming conventions (e.g. camelCaseVariable, PascalCaseClass, UPPERCASE_CONSTANT). We thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words without a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\").\n\nVerb prior: The correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. In addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative.

For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words \\emph{without} a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\"). \n\n\\textbf{Verb prior:}\nThe correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative.

At time of publication the reader has been public (without advertising) and has already been used by over 3,000 people from 50 countries. \nWith permission from Eric Roberts, we first made an eBook version of his Karel reader and simplified the English used \\cite{ericson2016identifying}.  The reader merges text and code in a seemless fashion. Then, for each language: we (a) translated code on each chapter using CodeInternational and (b) translated the reader text such that any reference to identifiers in the example code would use the same translations. In order to have text which is consistent with the corresponding code we heavily rely on the \"Posterior identifier translation map\" from CodeInternational's translations."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-27035226": 1, "wikipedia-6727548": 1, "wikipedia-1540855": 1, "wikipedia-30533678": 1, "wikipedia-218708": 1, "wikipedia-3235536": 1, "wikipedia-362386": 1, "wikipedia-194053": 1, "wikipedia-27037078": 1, "wikipedia-5309": 1, "arxiv-1710.00163": 1, "arxiv-2011.07376": 1, "arxiv-1910.11471": 1, "arxiv-2503.00144": 1, "arxiv-1911.04283": 1, "arxiv-1608.02621": 1, "arxiv-1608.05675": 1, "arxiv-2410.22335": 1, "arxiv-2408.14515": 1, "arxiv-1805.04342": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/7": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/13": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/5": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/17": 2, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/0": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/19": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/15": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/2": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-27035226": 1, "wikipedia-6727548": 1, "wikipedia-1540855": 1, "wikipedia-30533678": 1, "wikipedia-218708": 1, "wikipedia-3235536": 1, "wikipedia-362386": 1, "wikipedia-194053": 1, "wikipedia-27037078": 2, "wikipedia-5309": 1, "arxiv-1710.00163": 1, "arxiv-2011.07376": 1, "arxiv-1910.11471": 1, "arxiv-2503.00144": 1, "arxiv-1911.04283": 1, "arxiv-1608.02621": 1, "arxiv-1608.05675": 1, "arxiv-2410.22335": 1, "arxiv-2408.14515": 1, "arxiv-1805.04342": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/7": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/13": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/5": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/17": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/0": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/19": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/15": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/2": 2}}}

To translate code, it first parses the code and extracts four types of tokens:\nOur translation algorithm is as follows. We (1)  collect all of the target identifiers defined in the codebase and (2) translate them (enforcing that if two identifiers have the same name, they are given the same translation).

For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words \\emph{without} a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\"). \n\nAs an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative.

Code talkers are able to create a language mutually intelligible to each other but completely unintelligible to everyone who does not know the code. This causes a conflict of interests without actually causing any conflict at all. In the case of Navajo code-talkers, cryptanalysts were unable to decode messages in Navajo, even when using the most sophisticated methods available. At the same time, the code talkers were able to encrypt and decrypt messages quickly and easily by translating them into and from Navajo. Thus the code talker paradox refers to how human languages can be so similar and different at once: so similar that one can learn them both and gain the ability to translate from one to the other, yet so different that if someone knows one language but does not know another, it is not always possible to derive the meaning of a text by analyzing it or infer it from the other language.\nBaker solves the paradox with the theory of universal grammar. Within universal grammar, there are certain parameters that are shared by all languages. Languages differ from one another in that a given parameter may have different settings across languages. The number of possible combinations of parameter settings accounts for the diversity of human languages, and the fact that every human brain is wired to process the same parameters means that to learn a new language, the brain simply adapts what it already knows. The brain recognizes the parameters of the first language to which it was exposed and when it processes a different language, it simply changes the values of corresponding parameters.

These are phrases like \"ut in proverbio dicitur [\"as is said in the proverb\"]\" and \"ut ferunt peritii [\"as experience bears out\"]\". Most of the language switches, however, consisted of what Muysken called alternation: longer fragments like clauses or long phrases.

Raw data is useful once it is interpreted. After data has been analyzed, it can begin to convey a message. Any data that conveys a meaningful message becomes information. On a high level, unprocessed data takes the following forms to translate into exact message: noisy data; relevant and irrelevant data, filtered data; only relevant data, information; data that conveys a vague message, knowledge; data that conveys a precise message, wisdom; data that conveys exact message and reason behind it. To derive wisdom from an unprocessed data, we need to start processing it, refine the dataset by including data that we want to focus on, and organize data to identify information. In the context of social media analytics, data identification means \"what\" content is of interest. In addition to the text of content, we want to know: who wrote the text? Where was it found or on which social media venue did it appear? Are we interested in information from a specific locale? When did someone say something in social media?\nAttributes of data that need to be considered are as follows:\nBULLET::::- Structure: Structured data is a data that has been organized into a formatted repository - typically a database - so that its elements can be made addressable for more effective processing and analysis. The unstructured data, unlike structured data, is the least formatted data.\nBULLET::::- Language: Language becomes significant if we want to know the sentiment of a post rather than number of mentions.\nBULLET::::- Region: It is important to ensure that the data included in the analysis is only from that region of the world where the analysis is focused on. For example, if the goal is to identify the clean water problems in India, we would want to make sure that the data collected is from India only.\nBULLET::::- Type of Content: The content of data could be Text (written text that is easy to read and understand if you know the language), Photos (drawings, simple sketches, or photographs), Audio (audio recordings of books, articles, talks, or discussions), or Videos (recording, live streams).\nBULLET::::- Venue: Social media content is getting generated in a variety of venues such as news sites and social networking sites (e.g. Facebook, Twitter). Depending on the type of project the data is collected for, the venue becomes very significant.\nBULLET::::- Time: It is important to collect data posted in the time frame that is being analyzed.\nBULLET::::- Ownership of Data: Is the data private or publicly available? Is there any copyright in the data? These are the important questions to be addressed before collecting data.\nSection::::Process.:Data analysis.\nData analysis is the set of activities that assist in transforming raw data into insight, which in turn leads to a new base of knowledge and business value. In other words, data analysis is the phase that takes filtered data as input and transforms that into information of value to the analysts. Many different types of analysis can be performed with social media data, including analysis of posts, sentiment, sentiment drivers, geography, demographics, etc. The data analysis step begins once we know what problem we want to solve and know that we have sufficient data that is enough to generate a meaningful result. How can we know if we have enough evidence to warrant a conclusion? The answer to this question is: we don't know. We can't know this unless we start analyzing the data. While analyzing if we found the data isn't sufficient, reiterate the first phase and modify the question. If the data is believed to be sufficient for analysis, we need to build a data model.\nDeveloping a data model is a process or method that we use to organize data elements and standardize how the individual data elements relate to each other. This step is important because we want to run a computer program over the data; we need a way to tell the computer which words or themes are important and if certain words relate to the topic we are exploring.\nIn the analysis of our data, it's handy to have several tools available at our disposal to gain a different perspective on discussions taking place around the topic. The aim here is to configure the tools to perform at peak for a particular task. For example, thinking about a word cloud, if we take a large amount of data around computer professionals, say the \"IT architect\", and built a word cloud, no doubt the largest word in the could would be \"architect\". This analysis is also about tool usage. Some tools may do a good job at determining sentiment, where as others may do a better job at breaking down text into a grammatical form that enables us to better understand the meaning and use of various words or phrases. In performing analytic analysis, it is difficult to enumerate each and every step to take on an analytical journey. It is very much an iterative approach as there is no prescribed way of doing things.\nThe taxonomy and the insight derived from that analysis are as follows:\nBULLET::::- Depth of Analysis: Simple descriptive statistics based on streaming data, ad hoc analysis on accumulated data or deep analysis performed on accumulated data. This analysis dimension is really driven by the amount of time available to come up with the results of a project. This can be considered as a broad continuum, where the analysis time ranges from few hours at one end to several months at the other end. This analysis can answer following type of questions:\nBULLET::::- How many people mentioned Wikipedia in their tweets?\nBULLET::::- Which politician had the highest number of likes during the debate?\nBULLET::::- Which competitor is gathering the most mentions in the context of social business?\nBULLET::::- Machine Capacity: The amount of CPU needed to process data sets in a reasonable time period. Capacity numbers need to address not only the CPU needs but also the network capacity needed to retrieve data. This analysis could be performed as real-time, near real-time, ad hoc exploration and deep analysis. Real-time analysis in social media is an important tool when trying to understand the public's perception of a certain topic as it unfolding to allow for reaction or an immediate change in course. In near real-time analysis, we assume that data is ingested into the tool at a rate that is less than real-time. Ad hoc analysis is a process designed to answer a single specific question. The product of ad hoc analysis is typically a report or data summary. A deep analysis implies an analysis that spans a long time and involves a large amount of data, which typically translates into a high CPU requirement.\nBULLET::::- Domain of Analysis: The domain of the analysis is broadly classified into external social media and internal social media. Most of the time when people use the term social media, they mean external social media. This includes content generated from popular social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. Internal social media includes enterprise social network, which is a private social network used to assist communication within business.\nBULLET::::- Velocity of Data: The velocity of data in social media can be divided into two categories: data at rest and data in motion. Dimensions of velocity of data in motion can answer questions such as: How the sentiment of the general population is changing about the players during the course of match? Is the crowd conveying positive sentiment about the player who is actually losing the game? In these cases, the analysis is done as arrives. In this analysis, the amount of detail produced is directly correlated to the complexity of the analytical tool or system. A highly complex tool produces more amounts of details. The second type of analysis in the context of velocity is an analysis of data at rest. This analysis is performed once the data is fully collected. Performing this analysis can provide insights such as: which of your company's products has the most mentions as compared to others? What is the relative sentiment around your products as compared to a competitor's product?\nSection::::Process.:Information interpretation.\nThe insights derived from analysis can be as varied as the original question that was posed in step one of analysis. At this stage, as the nontechnical business users are the receivers of the information, the form of presenting the data becomes important. How could the data make sense efficiently so it could be used in good decision making? Visualization (graphics) of the information is the answer to this question.\nThe best visualizations are ones that expose something new about the underlying patterns and relationships contain the data. Exposure of the patterns and understating them play a key role in decision making process. Mainly there are three criteria to consider in visualizing data.\nBULLET::::- Understand the audience: before building the visualization, set up a goal, which is to convey great quantities of information in a format that is easily assimilated by the consumer of information. It is important to answer \"Who is the audience?\", and \"Can you assume"], "wikipedia-9223719": ["Community needs assessments are generally executed in four steps: planning and organizing, data collection, coding and summarizing the needs assessment results, and sharing the results with the community to facilitate action planning.

This information guides the selection process for a focus group. The principle of the focus group is to select members who are diverse yet share a degree of commonality. This may sound paradoxical yet it isn't necessarily. Generally speaking the commonality between focus group members is a vested interest and stake in their community. Thus, focus group members might include: \"local politicians, business owners, block club leaders and community activists. Another focus group would consist of adult resident of the community; and a third consisting of youth residents of the community\".\n\nFocus groups solicit input from community members on broad, open-ended questions, such as:\nBULLET::::- What do you like about your community?\nBULLET::::- What concerns you within your community?\nBULLET::::- How would you improve your community?\nBULLET::::- What changes do you foresee/fear/want to see in your community within the next 10 years?\n\nQuestions such as these can help target potential strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and needs for change or growth.\n\nWith the targeted objectives discovered in the focus group, the community needs assessment survey can be created and dispersed. \n\nLeaders of the community needs assessment can then summarize the data through computer analysis programs such as Access or SPSS.

The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value, in addition to referring to the variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run time, and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of program execution.\nVariables in programming are frequently given long names to make them relatively descriptive of their use, whereas variables in mathematics often have terse, one- or two-character names for brevity in transcription and manipulation.", "Unlike their mathematical counterparts, programming variables and constants commonly take multiple-character names, e.g. codice_15 or codice_16. Single-character names are most commonly used only for auxiliary variables; for instance, codice_17, codice_18, codice_19 for array index variables.\nSome naming conventions are enforced at the language level as part of the language syntax which involves the format of valid identifiers. In almost all languages, variable names cannot start with a digit (0\u20139) and cannot contain whitespace characters. Whether or not punctuation marks are permitted in variable names varies from language to language; many languages only permit the underscore (\"_\") in variable names and forbid all other punctuation. In some programming languages, sigils (symbols or punctuation) are affixed to variable identifiers to indicate the variable's datatype or scope.\nCase-sensitivity of variable names also varies between languages and some languages require the use of a certain case in naming certain entities; Most modern languages are case-sensitive; some older languages are not. Some languages reserve certain forms of variable names for their own internal use; in many languages, names beginning with two underscores (\"__\") often fall under this category.\nHowever, beyond the basic restrictions imposed by a language, the naming of variables is largely a matter of style. At the machine code level, variable names are not used, so the exact names chosen do not matter to the computer. Thus names of variables identify them, for the rest they are just a tool for programmers to make programs easier to write and understand. Using poorly chosen variable names can make code more difficult to review than non-descriptive names, so names which are clear are often encouraged.\nProgrammers often create and adhere to code style guidelines which offer guidance on naming variables or impose a precise naming scheme. Shorter names are faster to type but are less descriptive; longer names often make programs easier to read and the purpose of variables easier to understand. However, extreme verbosity in variable names can also lead to less comprehensible code."], "wikipedia-1079500": ["An identifier is the name of an element in the code.

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. We segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. camelCaseVariable, PascalCaseClass, UPPERCASE_CONSTANT). We thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words without a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\").\n\nVerb prior: The correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. In addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative.

In some languages, like C or Python, reserved words and keywords coincide, while in other languages, like Java, all keywords are reserved words, but some reserved words are not keywords \u2013 these are \"reserved for future use\".

Further, reserved words may not be redefined by the programmer, but predefineds can often be overridden in some capacity.\n\nIn many languages, such as C and similar environments like C++, a \"keyword\" is a reserved word which identifies a syntactic form. Words used in control flow constructs, such as if, codice_15, and codice_46 are keywords. In these languages, keywords cannot also be used as the names of variables or functions."], "wikipedia-20036": ["Metasyntactic variables are used to name entities such as variables, functions, and commands whose exact identity is unimportant and serve only to demonstrate a concept, which is useful for teaching programming.\n\nDue to English being the foundation-language, or lingua franca, of most computer programming languages these variables are commonly seen even in programs and examples of programs written for other spoken-language audiences.\n\nThe typical names may depend however on the subculture that has developed around a given programming language."], "wikipedia-19792997": ["At the level of identifiers (names, rather than variables), this is known as name masking.

This separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run time, and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of program execution.\nVariables in computer programming are frequently given long names to make them relatively descriptive of their use, whereas variables in mathematics often have terse, one- or two-character names for brevity in transcription and manipulation.\nAn identifier referencing a variable can be used to access the variable in order to read out the value, or alter the value, or edit other attributes of the variable, such as access permission, locks, semaphores, etc.\nFor instance, a variable might be referenced by the identifier \"codice_1\" and the variable can contain the number 1956. If the same variable is referenced by the identifier \"codice_2\" as well, and if using this identifier \"codice_2\", the value of the variable is altered to 2009, then reading the value using the identifier \"codice_1\" will yield a result of 2009 and not 1956.\nIf a variable is only referenced by a single identifier that can simply be called \"the name of the variable\". Otherwise, we can speak of \"one of the names of the variable\". For instance, in the previous example, the \"codice_1\" is a name of the variable in question, and \"codice_2\" is another name of the same variable.", "Unlike their mathematical counterparts, programming variables and constants commonly take multiple-character names, e.g. codice_15 or codice_16. Single-character names are most commonly used only for auxiliary variables; for instance, codice_17, codice_18, codice_19 for array index variables.\nSome naming conventions are enforced at the language level as part of the language syntax which involves the format of valid identifiers. In almost all languages, variable names cannot start with a digit (0\u20139) and cannot contain whitespace characters. Whether or not punctuation marks are permitted in variable names varies from language to language; many languages only permit the underscore (\"_\") in variable names and forbid all other punctuation. In some programming languages, sigils (symbols or punctuation) are affixed to variable identifiers to indicate the variable's datatype or scope.\nCase-sensitivity of variable names also varies between languages and some languages require the use of a certain case in naming certain entities; Most modern languages are case-sensitive; some older languages are not. Some languages reserve certain forms of variable names for their own internal use; in many languages, names beginning with two underscores (\"__\") often fall under this category.\nHowever, beyond the basic restrictions imposed by a language, the naming of variables is largely a matter of style. At the machine code level, variable names are not used, so the exact names chosen do not matter to the computer. Thus names of variables identify them, for the rest they are just a tool for programmers to make programs easier to write and understand. Using poorly chosen variable names can make code more difficult to review than non-descriptive names, so names which are clear are often encouraged.\nProgrammers often create and adhere to code style guidelines which offer guidance on naming variables or impose a precise naming scheme. Shorter names are faster to type but are less descriptive; longer names often make programs easier to read and the purpose of variables easier to understand.

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. \nWe segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. \\texttt{camelCaseVariable}, \\texttt{PascalCaseClass}, \\texttt{UPPERCASE\\_CONSTANT}).\nWe thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words \\emph{without} a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\"). \n\n\\textbf{Verb prior:}\nThe correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative.

As a control, in some contexts, no adverb was present. When the novel adjective was presented with the adverb \"very\", the children assigned a relative GA meaning to it, and when it was presented with adverb \"completely\", a maximal GA. When no adverb was present, the children were unable to assign a meaning to the adjective. This shows that, in order for children to learn the meaning of a new adjective, they depend on grammatical information provide by adverbs about the semantic class of the novel adjective.\nAn experiment by Wellwood, Gagliardi, and Lidz (2016) showed that four-year-olds associate unknown words with a quality meaning when they are presented with adjective syntax, and with a quantitative meaning when they are presented with determiner syntax. For example, in \"Gleebest of the cows are by the barn,\" \"gleebest\" would be interpreted as \"many\" or \"four,\" a quantity. Yet children associate the same unknown word with a quality interpretation when the word is presented in an adjective position. In the sentence \"The gleebest cows are by the barn,\" \"gleebest\" would be interpreted as \"striped\" or \"purple,\" a quality.

Hodges] regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations.\nAll computers and related equipment configurations brought into the Federal Government inventory on and after July 1, 1969, must have the capability to use the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used.\nASCII was the most common character encoding on the World Wide Web until December 2007, when UTF-8 encoding surpassed it; UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII.", "ASCII was incorporated into the Unicode (1991) character set as the first 128 symbols, so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows UTF-8 to be backward compatible with 7-bit ASCII, as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters. Even more importantly, forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged."], "wikipedia-3282778": ["The ASCII text-encoding standard uses 128 unique values (0\u2013127) to represent the alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation characters commonly used in English, plus a selection of control codes which do not represent printable characters.

Systems based on ASCII use seven bits to represent these values digitally.\nIn contrast, most computers store data in memory organized in eight-bit bytes. Files that contain machine-executable code and non-textual data typically contain all 256 possible eight-bit byte values. Many computer programs came to rely on this distinction between seven-bit \"text\" and eight-bit \"binary\" data, and would not function properly if non-ASCII characters appeared in data that was expected to include only ASCII text. For example, if the value of the eighth bit is not preserved, the program might interpret a byte value above 127 as a flag telling it to perform some function.\nIt is often desirable, however, to be able to send non-textual data through text-based systems, such as when one might attach an image file to an e-mail message. To accomplish this, the data is encoded in some way, such that eight-bit data is encoded into seven-bit ASCII characters (generally using only alphanumeric and punctuation characters\u2014the ASCII printable characters).

Many communications protocols, most importantly SMTP and HTTP, require the character encoding of content to be tagged with IANA-assigned character set identifiers. Some multi-byte character encodings (character encodings that can handle more than 256 different characters) are also true extended ASCII. That means all ASCII characters are encoded with a single byte with the same value as ASCII, and these values are not used anywhere else.

Some popular peripherals only implemented a 64-printing-character subset: Teletype Model 33 could not transmit \"a\" through \"z\" or five less-common symbols (\"`\", \"{\", \"|\", \"}\", and \"~\"). and when they received such characters they instead printed \"A\" through \"Z\" (forced all caps) and five other mostly-similar symbols (\"@\", \"[\", \"\\\", \"]\", and \"^\").\nThe ASCII character set is barely large enough for US English use and lacks many glyphs common in typesetting, and far too small for universal use.

Modified variants of 7-bit ASCII appeared promptly, trading some lesser-used symbols for highly desired symbols or letters, such as replacing \"#\" with \"\u00a3\" on UK Teletypes, \"\\\" with \"\u00a5\" in Japan or \"\u20a9\" in Korea, etc. At least 29 variant sets resulted. 12 code points were modified by at least one modified set, leaving only 82 \"invariant\" codes. Programming languages however had assigned meaning to many of the replaced characters, work-arounds were devised such as C three-character sequences \"??(\" and \"??)\" to represent \"{\" and \"}\". Languages with dissimilar basic alphabets could use transliteration, such as replacing all the Latin letters with the closest match Cyrillic letters (resulting in odd but somewhat readable text when English was printed in Cryllic or vice-versa).

What? Where? When? Why? and How?\" These questions help in determining the proper data sources to evaluate, which can affect the type of analysis that can be performed.\nData analysis is the set of activities that assist in transforming raw data into insight, which in turn leads to a new base of knowledge and business value. In other words, data analysis is the phase that takes filtered data as input and transforms that into information of value to the analysts. Many different types of analysis can be performed with social media data, including analysis of posts, sentiment, sentiment drivers, geography, demographics, etc.\nThe insights derived from analysis can be as varied as the original question that was posed in step one of analysis."], "wikipedia-4007073": ["Expression profiling is a logical next step after sequencing a genome: the sequence tells us what the cell could possibly do, while the expression profile tells us what it is actually doing at a point in time. Genes contain the instructions for making messenger RNA (mRNA), but at any moment each cell makes mRNA from only a fraction of the genes it carries. If a gene is used to produce mRNA, it is considered \"on\", otherwise \"off\". Many factors determine whether a gene is on or off, such as the time of day, whether or not the cell is actively dividing, its local environment, and chemical signals from other cells. For instance, skin cells, liver cells and nerve cells turn on (express) somewhat different genes and that is in large part what makes them different. Therefore, an expression profile allows one to deduce a cell's type, state, environment, and so forth.\nExpression profiling experiments often involve measuring the relative amount of mRNA expressed in two or more experimental conditions. This is because altered levels of a specific sequence of mRNA suggest a changed need for the protein coded by the mRNA, perhaps indicating a homeostatic response or a pathological condition. For example, higher levels of mRNA coding for alcohol dehydrogenase suggest that the cells or tissues under study are responding to increased levels of ethanol in their environment. Similarly, if breast cancer cells express higher levels of mRNA associated with a particular transmembrane receptor than normal cells do, it might be that this receptor plays a role in breast cancer. A drug that interferes with this receptor may prevent or treat breast cancer. In developing a drug, one may perform gene expression profiling experiments to help assess the drug's toxicity, perhaps by looking for changing levels in the expression of cytochrome P450 genes, which may be a biomarker of drug metabolism. Gene expression profiling may become an important diagnostic test."], "wikipedia-28486111": ["During the first decade of the century, Professor Caroline Haythornthwaite explored the impact of media type on the development of social ties, observing that human interactions can be analyzed to gain novel insight not from strong interactions (i.e. people that are strongly related to the subject) but, rather, from weak ties. This provides Learning Analytics with a central idea: apparently un-related data may hide crucial information.\n\nHer research also focused on the way that different types of media can impact the formation of networks. Her work highly contributed to the development of social network analysis as a field. Important ideas were inherited by Learning Analytics, such that a range of metrics and approaches can define the importance of a particular node, the value of information exchange, the way that clusters are connected to one another, structural gaps that might exist within those networks, etc.\n\nRecognizing unique traits, goals, and motivations of individuals remains an important activity in learning analytics.\n\nAdaptive hypermedia builds on user modelling by increasing personalization of content and interaction. In particular, adaptive hypermedia systems build a model of the goals, preferences and knowledge of each user, in order to adapt to the needs of that user.\n\nThe fields of learning analytics (LA) and educational data mining (EDM) have emerged with the aim of transforming this data into new insights that can benefit students, teachers, and administrators.\n\nMethods for learning analytics include:\nBULLET::::- Social learning analytics, which is aimed at exploring the role of social interaction in learning, the importance of learning networks, discourse used to sensemake, etc.\nBULLET::::- Disposition analytics, which seeks to capture data regarding student's dispositions to their own learning, and the relationship of these to their learning. For example, \"curious\" learners may be more inclined to ask questions, and this data can be captured and analysed for learning analytics.\n\nThere is a broad awareness of analytics across educational institutions for various stakeholders, but that the way learning analytics is defined and implemented may vary, including:\nBULLET::::1. for individual learners to reflect on their achievements and patterns of behaviour in relation to others.

Many other studies have focused on the manufacture and use of ceramics, architecture, food, fiber, and other types of material culture.

We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words \\emph{without} a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\"). \n\n\\textbf{Verb prior:}\nThe correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative. \n\n\\textbf{Translating short identifiers:}\nShort variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\".

See Figure \\ref{fig:lang-stats} for an overview.\nUsers on GitHub do not state their L1 (arterial) language. While a subset of users optionally state their country this is neither common nor reliable. To estimate a user's preferred language we use the language that they use in the git commit message. To find subsets of users who speak a given language, we search for all users who write git commits in that language. We observe that, especially in personal projects, users write commit messages in their L1 language at a higher rate than comments or identifiers. To identify languages we use Google Language Detect which is highly accurate (more so for common internet languages) and can identify languages with non-Roman Alphabet text which has been transliterated, for example it can detect both\\begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{gbsn}\\hspace{-3mm}\u7b97\u6cd5\\end{CJK*} the Chinese characters for ``algorithm\" and \"suanfa\", the Mandarin transliteration, as Chinese\\footnote{Google Translate provides a confidence for its language detection. We only consider positive detections with confidence > 0.5. We don't run language detection on ascii strings less than 2 characters long. Identifiers are turned into phrases using  case parsing as described in section 3. All \"positive\" results are manually verified.}. \nOf the 1.1 million GitHub users, 12.7\\% wrote commit messages in non-English languages. Of the non-English languages Chinese was the most common (28.6\\% of non-English committers), followed by Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Japanese.  More than 100 languages were detected in commit messages on public Java projects. Figure \\ref{fig:lang-stats} contains breakdowns and the appendix contains the full list. This does not match the distribution of non-English in web content (55\\% English) with both major and minor languages underrepresented. For example the prevalence of Spanish on GitHub (2.1\\%) is about half of webcontent (5.1\\% \\cite{www-lang-trends}) and further trails native speakers (7.8\\% of the worlds population \\cite{spanish-speakers}).\nGithub does not present a random sample of programs written in the world, and we consider the relevant confounds this introduces. \nTo that point, we believe the under-representation of certain languages is a form of Survivorship Bias.

An early example is the invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they saw, heard, felt, or thought to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry, and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and time.\nThe process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage. Decoding is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands, such as English or Spanish.\nOne reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or written, is difficult or impossible.

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. We segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. camelCaseVariable, PascalCaseClass, UPPERCASE_CONSTANT). We thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words without a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\").\n\nVerb prior: The correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. In addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative.\n\nTranslating short identifiers: Short variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\".

This does not match the distribution of non-English in web content (55\\% English) with both major and minor languages underrepresented. For example the prevalence of Spanish on GitHub (2.1\\%) is about half of webcontent (5.1\\% \\cite{www-lang-trends}) and further trails native speakers (7.8\\% of the worlds population \\cite{spanish-speakers}).\nGithub does not present a random sample of programs written in the world, and we consider the relevant confounds this introduces. \nTo that point, we believe the under-representation of certain languages is a form of Survivorship Bias. It suggests that users have found barriers to entry towards joining the GitHub community. Those barriers could derive from the English dominance of programming languages, code instruction, or the github interface."], "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/10": ["The use of non-English in identifiers and comments is \nlarge for the population of users who we define as non-English \"speakers\"\n(those who use non-English in their git-commit messages). 90\\% of users who use a non-English language in the commit messages also use that language in their comments or as identifiers. We note that, in Java, identifiers can be written in any script. \nSurprisingly, the patterns of non-English usage differs substantially when we condition on users \"speaking\" different languages. For example, among the detected Spanish speakers, 87.2\\% percent of users write identifiers in Spanish. On the other hand, among Chinese users only 23.3\\% of users write code with Chinese identifiers (either in Chinese script or ASCII). Figure 1b shows coding patterns conditioned on users speaking different languages. For each language we plot the percent of projects with identifiers in the language against the percent of projects with comments in the language. Languages naturally cluster into three categories: (1) \\textbf{Major-Euro-Latin:} languages with high use of non-English identifier including Spanish, German and French (2) \\textbf{Non-Latin:} languages in non-latin scripts including Russian and Chinese which have low use of non-English identifiers and (3) \\textbf{English-Comment:}  Programmers write their comments in English (> 70\\% of projects only have English comments). This group contains many smaller and non-European languages like Dutch and Bahasa Indonesia. \\~50\\% of projects in this group still uses their L1 language in identifiers.\nThe use of identifiers in local language (as opposed to English) is very clearly split on whether languages use the Latin alphabet.

Further, suppose that no one can look inside another's box, and each claims to know what a \"beetle\" is only by examining their own box. Wittgenstein suggests that, in such a situation, the word \"beetle\" could not be the name of a thing, because supposing that each person has something completely different in their boxes (or nothing at all) does not change the meaning of the word; the beetle as a private object \"drops out of consideration as irrelevant\".

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. \nWe segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. \\texttt{camelCaseVariable}, \\texttt{PascalCaseClass}, \\texttt{UPPERCASE\\_CONSTANT}).\nWe thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words \\emph{without} a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\"). \n\nVerb prior:\nThe correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative. \n\nTranslating short identifiers:\nShort variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\". We only translate identifiers which are at least two characters long.

Moreover, if students learn coding using their L1 language and enjoy it, they become intrinsically motivated to learn English, knowing that English would broaden their access to learning material (learning earning a language, with no short-term motives, could be dull  especially for young students). In this context CodeInternational can help students who are interacting with libraries in English. Perhaps more importantly our tool can help teachers rapidly develop localized content that builds off English content. The alternative: manual-translation of API, code-examples and website text, can be a huge barrier to translating material. Finally, our tool builds off GoogleTranslate, which is high accurate, but charges \\$1 per 50,000 characters. A free version would have a huge impact on utility.\nWe call for \\textbf{future work} from tool experts, for extending popular code-editors (e.g. vim, XCode, Visual Studio, Eclipse) to integrate with our APIs for back-and-forth translation and side-by-side display. Optionally, integrating with automatic text-to-speech (e.g. \\citep{wavenet-text2speech}) could allow students learn English pronunciation of code components. Moreover, one remaining feature in automatic human-translation of code is identifier consistency: if two identifiers have specific terms in common, eg getHeight, setHeight, we would like the translation of \"height\" to be consistent. While they are often consistent in our work, it is not enforced. Full consistency is hard, but not impossible, with modern neural machine translation."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-21922177": 1, "wikipedia-52335": 1, "wikipedia-23674": 1, "wikipedia-1673634": 1, "wikipedia-588531": 1, "wikipedia-13775157": 1, "wikipedia-42130800": 1, "wikipedia-3115040": 1, "wikipedia-6470064": 1, "wikipedia-326930": 1, "arxiv-1403.7050": 1, "arxiv-2504.07756": 1, "arxiv-2109.12451": 1, "arxiv-2401.13275": 1, "arxiv-2303.08080": 1, "arxiv-2403.14599": 1, "arxiv-1009.1341": 1, "arxiv-cond-mat/0502118": 1, "arxiv-1808.09055": 1, "arxiv-2207.13722": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/4": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/10": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/13": 2, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/14": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/7": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/8": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/22": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/17": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-21922177": 1, "wikipedia-52335": 1, "wikipedia-23674": 2, "wikipedia-1673634": 2, "wikipedia-588531": 1, "wikipedia-13775157": 1, "wikipedia-42130800": 1, "wikipedia-3115040": 1, "wikipedia-6470064": 1, "wikipedia-326930": 1, "arxiv-1403.7050": 1, "arxiv-2504.07756": 1, "arxiv-2109.12451": 1, "arxiv-2401.13275": 1, "arxiv-2303.08080": 1, "arxiv-2403.14599": 1, "arxiv-1009.1341": 1, "arxiv-cond-mat/0502118": 1, "arxiv-1808.09055": 1, "arxiv-2207.13722": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/4": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/10": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/13": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/14": 2, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/7": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/9": 2, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/8": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/22": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/17": 1}}}

Tokenization is performed using a modified version of \"Javalang\" (for Java) and the \"Parser\" library (for Python).

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. \nWe segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. \\texttt{camelCaseVariable}, \\texttt{PascalCaseClass}, \\texttt{UPPERCASE\\_CONSTANT}).\nWe thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words \\emph{without} a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\"). \n\nVerb prior:\nThe correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative. \n\nTranslating short identifiers:\nShort variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\". We only translate identifiers which are at least two characters long. This exception has its own edge-case: CJK (Chinese, Japanese Korean) identifiers can be  non-mathematical names even if only a character long."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-43900402": 1, "wikipedia-15322296": 1, "wikipedia-504357": 1, "wikipedia-33485748": 1, "wikipedia-988207": 1, "wikipedia-6742890": 1, "wikipedia-1754140": 1, "wikipedia-52454494": 1, "wikipedia-19748524": 1, "wikipedia-22268208": 1, "arxiv-2501.17704": 1, "arxiv-2012.04700": 1, "arxiv-1907.01172": 1, "arxiv-1708.04589": 1, "arxiv-2202.11337": 1, "arxiv-2310.01685": 1, "arxiv-1708.02696": 1, "arxiv-2311.00686": 1, "arxiv-2503.11117": 1, "arxiv-2411.17204": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/5": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/13": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/2": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/24": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/14": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-43900402": 1, "wikipedia-15322296": 1, "wikipedia-504357": 1, "wikipedia-33485748": 1, "wikipedia-988207": 1, "wikipedia-6742890": 2, "wikipedia-1754140": 1, "wikipedia-52454494": 2, "wikipedia-19748524": 2, "wikipedia-22268208": 1, "arxiv-2501.17704": 1, "arxiv-2012.04700": 1, "arxiv-1907.01172": 1, "arxiv-1708.04589": 1, "arxiv-2202.11337": 1, "arxiv-2310.01685": 1, "arxiv-1708.02696": 1, "arxiv-2311.00686": 1, "arxiv-2503.11117": 1, "arxiv-2411.17204": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/5": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/13": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/2": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/24": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/14": 2}}}

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. \nWe segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. \\texttt{camelCaseVariable}, \\texttt{PascalCaseClass}, \\texttt{UPPERCASE\\_CONSTANT}).\nWe thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words \\emph{without} a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\").\n\n\\textbf{Verb prior:}\nThe correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative. \n\n\\textbf{Translating short identifiers:}\nShort variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\".

Structure the problem by identifying the issues to be decided.\nBULLET::::2. Identify the stakeholders who control the issues, either directly or indirectly.\nBULLET::::3. Make an inventory of policy options by means of which the stakeholders control the issues.\nBULLET::::4. Determine the dependencies between the policy options.\nThe dependencies between options should typically be formulated as \"option X can only be implemented if option Y is also implemented\", or \"options Y and Z are mutually exclusive\". The result is a metagame model, which can then be analysed in different ways.\nSection::::Method.:Scenario development.\nThe possible outcomes of the game, based on the combination of options, are called scenarios. In theory, a game with N stakeholders s, ..., s who have Oi options (i = 1, ..., N), there are O\u00d7...\u00d7O possible outcomes. As the number of stakeholders and the number of the options they have increase, the number of scenarios will increase steeply due to a combinatorial explosion. Conversely, the dependencies between options will reduce the number of scenarios, because they rule out those containing logically or physically impossible combinations of options.\nIf the set of feasible scenarios is too large to be analysed in full, some combinations may be eliminated because the analyst judges them to be not worth considering. When doing so, the analyst should take care to preserve these particular types of scenarios :\nBULLET::::- The Status Quo, representing the future as it was previously expected.\nBULLET::::- The present scenario, which may differ from the Status Quo as it incorporates the intentions that are expressed by the stakeholders to change their plans; the Status Quo necessarily remains the same, but the present scenario may change as stakeholders interact and influence each other's plans.\nBULLET::::- The positions of different stakeholders, being the scenarios they would like others to agree to. Similar to the present scenario, positions may change through interaction.\nBULLET::::- Compromises between two stakeholders, defined as scenarios that, while not the position of either, are preferred by both to the other\u2019s position. A compromise does not necessarily have to involve all stakeholders.\nBULLET::::- Conflict points, defined as scenarios that stakeholders might move to in trying to force others to accept their positions.\nSection::::Method.:Scenario analysis.\nThe next step in the metagame analysis consists of the actual analysis of the scenarios generated so far. This analysis centres around stability and is broken down in the following four steps :\nBULLET::::1. Choose a particular scenario to analyse for stability. A scenario is stable if \"each stakeholder expects to do its part and expects others to do theirs.\" Note that stable scenarios are accepted by all stakeholders, but that acceptance does not need to be voluntary. There may be more than one stable scenario, the stability of a scenario may change, and unstable scenarios can also happen.\nBULLET::::2. Identify all unilateral improvements for stakeholders and subsets of stakeholders from the particular scenario. These are all the scenarios that are both preferred by all members of a certain subset and 'reachable' by them alone changing their selection of individual options.\nBULLET::::3. Identify all sanctions that exist to deter the unilateral improvements. A sanction against an improvement is a possible reaction to an improvement by the stakeholders who were not involved in the improvement. It is such that the stakeholder who was involved in the improvement finds the sanction not preferred to the particular scenario, making it not worthwhile for that stakeholder to have helped with the improvement. The general \"law of stability\" to be used in scenario analysis is: for a scenario to be stable, it is necessary for each credible improvement to be deterred by a credible sanction brSteps 1 to 3 need to be repeated to analyse some additional scenarios. When a number of scenarios have been analysed, one can proceed to the next step:\nBULLET::::4. Draw a strategic map, laying out all the threats and promises stakeholders can make to try to stabilise the situation at scenarios they prefer.

This information guides the selection process for a focus group. The principle of the focus group is to select members who are diverse yet share a degree of commonality. This may sound paradoxical yet it isn't necessarily. Generally speaking the commonality between focus group members is a vested interest and stake in their community. Thus, focus group members might include: \"local politicians, business owners, block club leaders and community activists.

The results are then brought to the community through a public forum.\n\nPublic forums are the place where the information collected through the survey, the identified strengths, weaknesses, and concerns of the community are presented for open public discussion.\n\nFinally, the results of the focus groups, survey, and public forum present a direction which the final report can detail.

Large scale surveys involving many people can reveal useful information, while smaller surveys may be less generalizable and used only in the context within which they are conducted. Survey design will vary depending on context, such as internet and phone surveys for well resourced communities or face to face surveys for less resourced communities.\nSection::::Community.:Methodology and data collection.:Community mapping.\nOften, a practitioner may be wanting to implement a service that they think will be of benefit to the community. The problem facing the practitioner will be where and how to place the service at a particular point in the community, and whether that service is likely to be used. Community mapping is where the practitioner gets people in the community to draw a map of the community of the places that they visit the most and how often they go there. This will give an indication of where to locate a service so that it is conveniently placed and accessible to community participants whom it is intended to service. The problem may arise where there are differences between the places that people visit.\nSection::::Community.:Methodology and data collection.:Seasonal calendar.\nA seasonal calendar allows the practitioner to look at seasonal trends that may affect the use or implementation of a service in a community. Seasonal trends may reveal decreases in the supply of labour, periods of hunger that may affect for example school children's performance at school and so on. Seasonal calendars may reveal important reasons for the gaps between service utilization and intervention outcomes. This will allow the practitioner to plan for other things that may not have been considered as part of the intervention but which will greatly improve the quality of the intervention and make life better for the community members. To use the seasonal calendar as a data collection tool, the practitioner gets community members to write a list of the things that they have to do throughout the year. These things are related to work, cultural activities, certain times of the year in which participants are unavailable at all and so on, and to plot how they share them with other members of the community.\nSection::::Community.:Methodology and data collection.:Focus group sessions.\nFocus groups are sessions in which community members can answer questions about different aspects of the intervention in the form of planned discussions.

We downloaded and analyzed the human language used for writing comments (in Java code), naming identifiers (method and variable names), and writing  \\textit{git commit} messages.\n\nWe focused on Java code as it is both one of the most popular source-code languages on GitHub and in the classroom.  \nA selection of results from this study are that:\nThis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first analysis of the human languages on GitHub. See Figure \\ref{fig:lang-stats} for an overview.\nUsers on GitHub do not state their L1 (arterial) language. While a subset of users optionally state their country this is neither common nor reliable. To estimate a user's preferred language we use the language that they use in the git commit message. To find subsets of users who speak a given language, we search for all users who write git commits in that language. We observe that, especially in personal projects, users write commit messages in their L1 language at a higher rate than comments or identifiers. To identify languages we use Google Language Detect which is highly accurate (more so for common internet languages) and can identify languages with non-Roman Alphabet text which has been transliterated, for example it can detect both\\begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{gbsn}\\hspace{-3mm}\u7b97\u6cd5\\end{CJK*} the Chinese characters for ``algorithm\" and \"suanfa\", the Mandarin transliteration, as Chinese\\footnote{Google Translate provides a confidence for its language detection. We only consider positive detections with confidence > 0.5. We don't run language detection on ascii strings less than 2 characters long. Identifiers are turned into phrases using  case parsing as described in section 3. All \"positive\" results are manually verified.}. \nOf the 1.1 million GitHub users, 12.7\\% wrote commit messages in non-English languages. Of the non-English languages Chinese was the most common (28.6\\% of non-English committers), followed by Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Japanese.  More than 100 languages were detected in commit messages on public Java projects. Figure \\ref{fig:lang-stats} contains breakdowns and the appendix contains the full list. This does not match the distribution of non-English in web content (55\\% English) with both major and minor languages underrepresented. For example the prevalence of Spanish on GitHub (2.1\\%) is about half of webcontent (5.1\\% \\cite{www-lang-trends}) and further trails native speakers (7.8\\% of the worlds population \\cite{spanish-speakers}).\nGithub does not present a random sample of programs written in the world, and we consider the relevant confounds this introduces. \nTo that point, we believe the under-representation of certain languages is a form of Survivorship Bias. It suggests that users have found barriers to entry towards joining the GitHub community. Those barriers could derive from the English dominance of programming languages, code instruction, or the github interface."], "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/18": ["To evaluate out translator we randomly selected 1,000 (1k) single file projects from public GitHub Java and translated them into the languages: Chinese, Spanish and Arabic.

(They felt that other existing languages such as C++ and their environments were far too complicated for beginners.) The programming language that they created was called SiMPLE.\nSiMPLE is vaguely reminiscent of the AppleSoft BASIC programming language that existed on the old Apple-II computers. However, SiMPLE is not (and was never intended to be) merely a \"clone\" of Applesoft BASIC. It was merely \"inspired\" by it. There are many features of Applesoft that needed to be improved. For example, Applesoft was an interpreted language, and so it ran somewhat slowly (even for a 1MHZ processor). SiMPLE, on the other hand, compiles into an executable (.EXE) file. So it not only produces programs that run faster, but those programs can even run on computers that don't have SiMPLE installed.\nAnother difference between the two languages is in the use of line numbers. Applesoft required them; SiMPLE doesn't even use them. (Instead of typing program statements onto the black Apple screen, SiMPLE uses a text editor.) Furthermore the \"FOR-NEXT\" loops in Applesoft have been replaced by \"Do-Loop\" instructions in SiMPLE. (But they function in much the same way).\nHowever, aside from a few differences in their outward appearances, writing programs in SiMPLE has a similar \"feel\" to what one experienced when writing programs in Applesoft. For example, when using SiMPLE in command-line mode, a program is run by simply typing the word \"RUN\" on a black screen (just as was done on the Apple!)\n\"Simple\" is a generic term for three slightly different versions of the language: Micro-SiMPLE, Pro-SiMPLE, and Ultra-SiMPLE.\n(a) Micro-SiMPLE is an introductory programming language designed to use only 4 keywords: Call, Set, If, and Goto."], "wikipedia-7130410": ["Several methods can achieve simplicity in a photograph.

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. \nWe segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. \\texttt{camelCaseVariable}, \\texttt{PascalCaseClass}, \\texttt{UPPERCASE\\_CONSTANT}).\nWe thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words \\emph{without} a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\"). \n\n\\textbf{Verb prior:}\nThe correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative. \n\n\\textbf{Translating short identifiers:}\nShort variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\". We only translate identifiers which are at least two characters long. This exception has its own edge-case: CJK (Chinese, Japanese Korean) identifiers can be  non-mathematical names even if only a character long."], "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/5": ["\\item \\textbf{Immutable}: consisting of language  keywords (\\texttt{while}, \\texttt{void}, etc), and identifiers imported from libraries that are external to the code being translated (e.g. \\texttt{FileReader} of \\texttt{java.io}).

It supports the growing set of human languages covered by Google Translate and is adaptive to the particular context of source-code. To translate code, it first parses the code and extracts four types of tokens:\nOur translation algorithm is as follows. We (1)  collect all of the target identifiers defined in the codebase and (2) translate them (enforcing that if two identifiers have the same name, they are given the same translation). Once the identifiers are translated we (3) translate the comments preserving structure and references to identifiers. (4) Finally string literals are optionally translated.

Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words \\emph{without} a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\"). \n\noindent\n\\textbf{Verb prior:}\nThe correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative."], "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/11": ["As an example a comment above a method specifies in script that it is calculating the Fibonacci sequence however the method name (an identifier) is transliterated \"//\\hspace{-3mm}\\begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{gbsn}\u6590\u6ce2\u90a3\u5951\\end{CJK*}\" however the code uses a transliteration of the phonemes in the script \"public int feibonaqie(int n)\"."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-48313622": 1, "wikipedia-23674": 1, "wikipedia-43645": 1, "wikipedia-49892": 1, "wikipedia-17218690": 1, "wikipedia-21133583": 1, "wikipedia-4853465": 1, "wikipedia-1040161": 1, "wikipedia-302645": 1, "wikipedia-41363180": 1, "arxiv-2103.00269": 1, "arxiv-2201.08570": 1, "arxiv-2308.12701": 1, "arxiv-2201.09476": 1, "arxiv-2103.11118": 1, "arxiv-2201.10705": 1, "arxiv-1409.1903": 1, "arxiv-2102.13555": 1, "arxiv-1409.4203": 1, "arxiv-2303.05771": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/14": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/10": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/5": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/24": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/12": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/11": 3}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-48313622": 1, "wikipedia-23674": 1, "wikipedia-43645": 2, "wikipedia-49892": 1, "wikipedia-17218690": 1, "wikipedia-21133583": 1, "wikipedia-4853465": 1, "wikipedia-1040161": 1, "wikipedia-302645": 1, "wikipedia-41363180": 1, "arxiv-2103.00269": 1, "arxiv-2201.08570": 1, "arxiv-2308.12701": 1, "arxiv-2201.09476": 1, "arxiv-2103.11118": 2, "arxiv-2201.10705": 1, "arxiv-1409.1903": 1, "arxiv-2102.13555": 1, "arxiv-1409.4203": 1, "arxiv-2303.05771": 2, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/14": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/10": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/5": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/24": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/12": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/11": 3}}}

In a systemic development approach, the first step is to define the boundaries, thresholds, and stakeholders. Understanding what is, is crucial to understand the layers of complexity of the development needs.\nSection::::Concepts.:Methodological.\nMethodology in systemic development must consider all variables, values, and sustainability principles, and aim to ensure that no elements have been neglected. It is important to ensure completeness, comprehensiveness, and transparency of the assessment. Mutual feedback and interactions between stakeholders should be modeled and assessed using carefully designed specific methodologies.\nSection::::Concepts.:Epistemological.\nEpistemology stresses how dialogue and communication by the stakeholders are the key tools to systemic development. This is when the verification and confirmation of the facets of the development process are discovered. Insight from each stakeholder is important to enhance and broaden the perspective of all involved. It is essential to take these viewpoints into consideration because they influence the process, the trends, the drivers of change, and the interactions between the parts. It is during this phase that learning is accomplished.\nSection::::Concepts.:Axiological.\nAxiologology emphasizes the ethical and aesthetic responsibility during the development process. It is important because the solution manifested by the systemic development process needs to represent the values of the represented stakeholders.\nSection::::Framework.:Holistic Thinking.\nTo successfully achieve development through a systems approach, holistic thinking is necessary. A holistic approach to a system thinks about each variable, the space between the variables and what defines the variable. \u201cIt\u2019s the sum of the interaction of its parts\u201d In this process each individual must learn from each other to understand the whole system in a multidimensional way to find a solution. To think about development with a systemic lens, one needs to be able to see the whole instead of parts and understand the relationship between the parts, the way the parts move, what drives the behavior of the parts, what influences the flow or direction, and to understand why there are no more or no fewer parts. The many factors that make up the whole can be a complex system.\nSection::::Framework.:Stakeholders.\nIncluding many diverse stakeholders helps each individual to grow their own perspective, gain an understanding of others and to increase their creativity. Systemic involvement must strive for a transdisciplinary approach instead of a multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary approach to achieve successful development. Transdisciplinary allows for the integration of methodologies and epistemologies through collaboration of the different stakeholders. Including more perspectives in the loop will increase the chance of a successful solution.\nSection::::Framework.:Communication and Learning.\nThe foundation of systemic development, systems thinking, when applied, creates knowledge which leads to expanded knowledge, which leads to success. Dialog is an essential tool for sharing knowledge and translating it into action. Communication can provide feedback and insight about \u201csystem, culture, practices, and artifacts and about the objectives and values of the project sponsor, client, and other stakeholders.\u201d Learning happens during the dialog process as each stakeholder comes to observe other stakeholder\u2019s values and ideas about what successful development would encompass.\nSection::::Framework.:Complex loop.\nA feedback loop, closed loop, or systems complex model is a tool to help cope with complexity and understand the system as a whole. The tool will help to visualize the direction, velocity, delay time, long term and short term effects, and to help see the dynamic process. Feedback is necessary to learn about each other, including objectives and values of stakeholders and officials. A systemic approach to development is change oriented.

These tests are conducted with/without actual users during each stage of the process from requirements, pre-production models and post production, completing a circle of proof back to and ensuring that \"development proceeds with the user as the center of focus.\"\n\nBelow are the general phases of User-Centered Design process:\nBULLET::::1. Specify context of use: Identify who the primary users of the product, why they will use the product, what are their requirements and under what environment they will use it.\nBULLET::::2. Specify Requirements: Once the context is specified, it is the time to identify the granular requirements of the product. This is an important process which can further facilitate the designers to create storyboards, and set important goals to make the product successful.\nBULLET::::3. Create Design solutions and development: Based on product goals and requirements, start an iterative process of product design and development.\nBULLET::::4. Evaluate Product: Product designers do usability testing to get users' feedback of the product. Product evaluation is a crucial step in product development which gives critical feedback of the product.\nIn the next steps, the above procedure is repeated to further finish the product. These phases are general approaches and factors like design goals, team and their timeline, and environment in which the product is developed, determine the appropriate phases for a project and their order.

Lean also takes into account waste created through and . Working from the perspective of the client who consumes a product or service, \"value\" is any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for.\nFor many, lean is the set of \"tools\" that assist in the identification and steady elimination of waste. As waste is eliminated quality improves while production time and cost are reduced.\nA non exhaustive list of such tools would include: SMED, value stream mapping, Five S, \"Kanban\" (pull systems), \"poka-yoke\" (error-proofing), total productive maintenance, elimination of time batching, mixed model processing, rank order clustering, single point scheduling, redesigning working cells, multi-process handling and control charts (for checking mura).\nThere is a second approach to lean manufacturing, which is promoted by Toyota, called The Toyota Way, in which the focus is upon improving the \"flow\" or smoothness of work, thereby steadily eliminating \"mura\" (\"unevenness\") through the system and not upon 'waste reduction' per se. Techniques to improve flow include production leveling, \"pull\" production (by means of \"kanban\") and the \"Heijunka box\".\nLean implementation emphasizes the importance of optimizing work flow through strategic operational procedures while minimizing waste and being adaptable. Flexibility is required to allow production leveling (Heijunka) using tools such as SMED, but have their analogues in other processes such as research and development (R&D). However, adaptability is often constrained, and therefore may not require significant investment. More importantly, all of these concepts have to be acknowledged by employees who develop the products and initiate processes that deliver value. The cultural and managerial aspects of lean are arguably more important than the actual tools or methodologies of production itself.\nIn 1999, Spear and Bowen identified four rules which characterize the \"Toyota DNA\":\nBULLET::::1. All work shall be highly specified as to content, sequence, timing, and outcome.\nBULLET::::2. Every customer-supplier connection must be direct, and there must be an unambiguous yes or no way to send requests and receive responses.\nBULLET::::3. The pathway for every product and service must be simple and direct.\nBULLET::::4. Any improvement must be made in accordance with the scientific method, under the guidance of a teacher, at the lowest possible level in the organization.", "The following steps should be implemented to create the ideal lean manufacturing system:\n- Design a simple manufacturing system\n- Recognize that there is always room for improvement\n- Continuously improve the lean manufacturing system design\n\nA fundamental principle of lean manufacturing is demand-based flow manufacturing. In this type of production setting, inventory is only pulled through each production center when it is needed to meet a customer's order.\n\nA continuous improvement mindset is essential to reach the company's goals. The term \"continuous improvement\" means incremental improvement of products, processes, or services over time, with the goal of reducing waste to improve workplace functionality, customer service, or product performance. Lean is founded on the concept of continuous and incremental improvements on product and process while eliminating redundant activities. \"The value of adding activities are simply only those things the customer is willing to pay for, everything else is waste, and should be eliminated, simplified, reduced, or integrated\" (Rizzardo, 2003). Improving the flow of material through new ideal system layouts at the customer's required rate would reduce waste in material movement and inventory."], "wikipedia-1304248": ["The framework bases its planning approach on a concept called \"backcasting\" and more specifically \"backcasting from sustainability principles\". Backcasting is the process of moving backwards from an imagined vision of success. One begins with an end in mind, moves backwards from the vision to the \"present\", and moves step-by-step towards the vision. It is essentially placing ourselves in the future, imagining that we have achieved success and looking back to ask the question: \u201cWhat do we need to do today to reach that successful outcome?\u201d. Instead of picturing how success could look like, backcasting is advocated from a principled vision of success in which specific conditions are met creates a shared understanding of success.\n\nThe ABCD method is the approach with which the framework backcasting from the 4 sustainability principles can be applied to an organization. The letters represent the following steps (FSSD academic ABCD and TNS ABCD method differ slightly):\nA: Awareness and visioning. After understanding the system your organization works within and the principles, members of the organization create a vision on how they would like the organization to be. Organisations should also identify the service they provide, independent of the product, sparking more creative goals.\nB: Baseline assessment. The organisation analyses and maps what it has been doing currently and evaluates it based on the 4 principles. It allows for the organisation to identify critical issues, implications and opportunities.\nC: Creative solutions. Members of the organisation brainstorm for solutions to the issues raised previously, without constraint. With the vision and potential actions, organisations backcast to develop strategies for sustainability.\nD: Decide on priorities. The organisation prioritizes the different actions developed previously that help gear it to sustainability in the fastest and most optimal way, by asking a set of questions: by asking: \ni) Does this action move us in the right direction? \nii) Can this action be built upon in future? \niii) Does this action bring an acceptable financial, ecological and/or social return on investment?.

For pure and new designs, the system design stage is where an Instruction set and operation is planned out, and in most chips existing instruction sets are modified for newer functionality. Design at this stage is often statements such as \"encodes in the MP3 format\" or \"implements IEEE floating-point arithmetic\". At later stages in the design process, each of these innocent looking statements expands to hundreds of pages of textual documentation.\nUpon agreement of a system design, RTL designers then implement the functional models in a hardware description language like Verilog, SystemVerilog, or VHDL. Using digital design components like adders, shifters, and state machines as well as computer architecture concepts like pipelining, superscalar execution, and branch prediction, RTL designers will break a functional description into hardware models of components on the chip working together. Each of the simple statements described in the system design can easily turn into thousands of lines of RTL code, which is why it is extremely difficult to verify that the RTL will do the right thing in all the possible cases that the user may throw at it.\nTo reduce the number of functionality bugs, a separate hardware verification group will take the RTL and design testbenches and systems to check that the RTL actually is performing the same steps under many different conditions, classified as the domain of functional verification.

To think about development with a systemic lens, one needs to be able to see the whole instead of parts and understand the relationship between the parts, the way the parts move, what drives the behavior of the parts, what influences the flow or direction, and to understand why there are no more or no fewer parts. The many factors that make up the whole can be a complex system.\n\nIncluding many diverse stakeholders helps each individual to grow their own perspective, gain an understanding of others and to increase their creativity. Systemic involvement must strive for a transdisciplinary approach instead of a multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary approach to achieve successful development. Transdisciplinary allows for the integration of methodologies and epistemologies through collaboration of the different stakeholders. Including more perspectives in the loop will increase the chance of a successful solution.\n\nThe foundation of systemic development, systems thinking, when applied, creates knowledge which leads to expanded knowledge, which leads to success. Dialog is an essential tool for sharing knowledge and translating it into action. Communication can provide feedback and insight about \u201csystem, culture, practices, and artifacts and about the objectives and values of the project sponsor, client, and other stakeholders.\u201d Learning happens during the dialog process as each stakeholder comes to observe other stakeholder\u2019s values and ideas about what successful development would encompass.\n\nA feedback loop, closed loop, or systems complex model is a tool to help cope with complexity and understand the system as a whole. The tool will help to visualize the direction, velocity, delay time, long term and short term effects, and to help see the dynamic process. Feedback is necessary to learn about each other, including objectives and values of stakeholders and officials. A systemic approach to development is change oriented. The approach must encourage humans to communicate through interpersonal interactions, address the values of each stakeholder, and take part in developing and understanding the complex loop."], "wikipedia-504357": ["Below are the general phases of User-Centered Design process:\nBULLET::::1. Specify context of use: Identify who the primary users of the product, why they will use the product, what are their requirements and under what environment they will use it.\nBULLET::::2. Specify Requirements: Once the context is specified, it is the time to identify the granular requirements of the product. This is an important process which can further facilitate the designers to create storyboards, and set important goals to make the product successful.\nBULLET::::3. Create Design solutions and development: Based on product goals and requirements, start an iterative process of product design and development.\nBULLET::::4. Evaluate Product: Product designers do usability testing to get users' feedback of the product. Product evaluation is a crucial step in product development which gives critical feedback of the product.\nIn the next steps, the above procedure is repeated to further finish the product. These phases are general approaches and factors like design goals, team and their timeline, and environment in which the product is developed, determine the appropriate phases for a project and their order. You can either follow a waterfall model, agile model or any other software engineering practice."], "wikipedia-218445": ["For many, lean is the set of \"tools\" that assist in the identification and steady elimination of waste. As waste is eliminated quality improves while production time and cost are reduced.\nA non exhaustive list of such tools would include: SMED, value stream mapping, Five S, \"Kanban\" (pull systems), \"poka-yoke\" (error-proofing), total productive maintenance, elimination of time batching, mixed model processing, rank order clustering, single point scheduling, redesigning working cells, multi-process handling and control charts (for checking mura).\nThere is a second approach to lean manufacturing, which is promoted by Toyota, called The Toyota Way, in which the focus is upon improving the \"flow\" or smoothness of work, thereby steadily eliminating \"mura\" (\"unevenness\") through the system and not upon 'waste reduction' per se. Techniques to improve flow include production leveling, \"pull\" production (by means of \"kanban\") and the \"Heijunka box\". This is a fundamentally different approach from most improvement methodologies, and requires considerably more persistence than basic application of the tools, which may partially account for its lack of popularity.\nThe difference between these two approaches is not the goal itself, but rather the prime approach to achieving it. The implementation of smooth flow exposes quality problems that already existed, and thus waste reduction naturally happens as a consequence. The advantage claimed for this approach is that it naturally takes a system-wide perspective, whereas a waste focus sometimes wrongly assumes this perspective.\nBoth lean and TPS can be seen as a loosely connected set of potentially competing principles whose goal is cost reduction by the elimination of waste. These principles include: pull processing, perfect first-time quality, waste minimization, continuous improvement, flexibility, building and maintaining a long term relationship with suppliers, autonomation, load leveling and production flow and visual control. The disconnected nature of some of these principles perhaps springs from the fact that the TPS has grown pragmatically since 1948 as it responded to the problems it saw within its own production facilities. Thus what one sees today is the result of a 'need' driven learning to improve where each step has built on previous ideas and not something based upon a theoretical framework.\nToyota's view is that the main method of lean is not the tools, but the reduction of three types of waste: , , and , to expose problems systematically and to use the tools where the ideal cannot be achieved. From this perspective, the tools are workarounds adapted to different situations, which explains any apparent incoherence of the principles above.\nLean implementation emphasizes the importance of optimizing work flow through strategic operational procedures while minimizing waste and being adaptable. Flexibility is required to allow production leveling (Heijunka) using tools such as SMED, but have their analogues in other processes such as research and development (R&D). However, adaptability is often constrained, and therefore may not require significant investment. More importantly, all of these concepts have to be acknowledged by employees who develop the products and initiate processes that deliver value. The cultural and managerial aspects of lean are arguably more important than the actual tools or methodologies of production itself. There are many examples of lean tool implementation without sustained benefit, and these are often blamed on weak understanding of lean throughout the whole organization.\nLean aims to enhance productivity by simplifying the operational structure enough to understand, perform and manage the work environment. To achieve these three goals simultaneously, one of Toyota's mentoring methodologies (loosely called \"Senpai\" and \"Kohai\" which is Japanese for senior and junior), can be used to foster lean thinking throughout the organizational structure from the ground up. The closest equivalent to Toyota's mentoring process is the concept of \"\"Lean Sensei\",\" which encourages companies, organizations, and teams to seek third-party experts that can provide advice and coaching.\nIn 1999, Spear and Bowen identified four rules which characterize the \"Toyota DNA\":\nBULLET::::1. All work shall be highly specified as to content, sequence, timing, and outcome.\nBULLET::::2. Every customer-supplier connection must be direct, and there must be an unambiguous yes or no way to send requests and receive responses.\nBULLET::::3. The pathway for every product and service must be simple and direct.\nBULLET::::4. Any improvement must be made in accordance with the scientific method, under the guidance of a teacher, at the lowest possible level in the organization.", "The following steps should be implemented to create the ideal lean manufacturing system:\nBULLET::::- Design a simple manufacturing system\nBULLET::::- Recognize that there is always room for improvement\nBULLET::::- Continuously improve the lean manufacturing system design\n\nSection::::Steps to achieve lean systems.:Design a simple manufacturing system.\nA fundamental principle of lean manufacturing is demand-based flow manufacturing. In this type of production setting, inventory is only pulled through each production center when it is needed to meet a customer's order. The benefits of this goal include:\nBULLET::::- Decreased cycle time\nBULLET::::- Less inventory\nBULLET::::- Increased productivity\nBULLET::::- Increased capital equipment utilization\n\nSection::::Steps to achieve lean systems.:Continuous improvement.\nA continuous improvement mindset is essential to reach the company's goals. The term \"continuous improvement\" means incremental improvement of products, processes, or services over time, with the goal of reducing waste to improve workplace functionality, customer service, or product performance. Lean is founded on the concept of continuous and incremental improvements on product and process while eliminating redundant activities. \"The value of adding activities are simply only those things the customer is willing to pay for, everything else is waste, and should be eliminated, simplified, reduced, or integrated\" (Rizzardo, 2003). Improving the flow of material through new ideal system layouts at the customer's required rate would reduce waste in material movement and inventory.\n\nSection::::Steps to achieve lean systems.:Measure.\nOverall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is a set of performance metrics that fit well in a lean environment. Also, PMTS, methods-time measurement, cost analysis and perhaps time study can be used to evaluate the wastes and IT effectiveness in the operational processes. For example, Jun-Ing Ker and Yichuan Wang analyze two prescribing technologies, namely no carbon required (NCR) and digital scanning technologies to quantify the advantages of the medication ordering, transcribing, and dispensing process in a multi-hospital health system. With comparison between these two technologies, the statistical analysis results show a significant reduction on process times by adopting digital scanning technology. The results indicated a reduction of 54.5% in queue time, 32.4% in order entry time, 76.9% in outgoing delay time, and 67.7% in outgoing transit time with the use of digital scanning technology."], "wikipedia-1304248": ["Section::::Framework.:FSSD - Tools Level.:ABCD Method.\nThe ABCD method is the approach with which the framework backcasting from the 4 sustainability principles can be applied to an organization.

After understanding the system your organization works within and the principles, members of the organization create a vision on how they would like the organization to be. Organisations should also identify the service they provide, independent of the product, sparking more creative goals.\nB: Baseline assessment. The organisation analyses and maps what it has been doing currently and evaluates it based on the 4 principles. It allows for the organisation to identify critical issues, implications and opportunities.\nC: Creative solutions. Members of the organisation brainstorm for solutions to the issues raised previously, without constraint. With the vision and potential actions, organisations backcast to develop strategies for sustainability.\nD: Decide on priorities. The organisation prioritizes the different actions developed previously that help gear it to sustainability in the fastest and most optimal way, by asking a set of questions: by asking: \ni) Does this action move us in the right direction? \nii) Can this action be built upon in future? \niii) Does this action bring an acceptable financial, ecological and/or social return on investment?.

The user may use a variety of languages and tools to create this description. Examples include a C/C++ model, SystemC, SystemVerilog Transaction Level Models, Simulink and MATLAB.\nBULLET::::- RTL design: This step converts the user specification (what the user wants the chip to do) into a register transfer level (RTL) description. The RTL describes the exact behavior of the digital circuits on the chip, as well as the interconnections to inputs and outputs.\nBULLET::::- Physical design: This step takes the RTL, and a library of available logic gates, and creates a chip design. This involves figuring out which gates to use, defining places for them, and wiring them together.", "turn the preliminary design into a system-level specification that can be simulated with simple models using languages like C++ and MATLAB and emulation tools. For pure and new designs, the system design stage is where an Instruction set and operation is planned out, and in most chips existing instruction sets are modified for newer functionality. Design at this stage is often statements such as \"encodes in the MP3 format\" or \"implements IEEE floating-point arithmetic\". At later stages in the design process, each of these innocent looking statements expands to hundreds of pages of textual documentation.\nSection::::Design process.:RTL design.\nUpon agreement of a system design, RTL designers then implement the functional models in a hardware description language like Verilog, SystemVerilog, or VHDL. Using digital design components like adders, shifters, and state machines as well as computer architecture concepts like pipelining, superscalar execution, and branch prediction, RTL designers will break a functional description into hardware models of components on the chip working together. Each of the simple statements described in the system design can easily turn into thousands of lines of RTL code, which is why it is extremely difficult to verify that the RTL will do the right thing in all the possible cases that the user may throw at it.\nTo reduce the number of functionality bugs, a separate hardware verification group will take the RTL and design testbenches and systems to check that the RTL actually is performing the same steps under many different conditions, classified as the domain of functional verification. Many techniques are used, none of them perfect but all of them useful \u2013 extensive logic simulation, formal methods, hardware emulation, lint-like code checking, code coverage, and so on.\nA tiny error here can make the whole chip useless, or worse. The famous Pentium FDIV bug caused the results of a division to be wrong by at most 61 parts per million, in cases that occurred very infrequently. No one even noticed it until the chip had been in production for months. Yet Intel was forced to offer to replace, for free, every chip sold until they could fix the bug, at a cost of $475 million (US).\nSection::::Design process.:Physical design.\nRTL is only a behavioral model of the actual functionality of what the chip is supposed to operate under. It has no link to a physical aspect of how the chip would operate in real life at the materials, physics, and electrical engineering side. For this reason, the next step in the IC design process, physical design stage, is to map the RTL into actual geometric representations of all electronics devices, such as capacitors, resistors, logic gates, and transistors that will go on the chip.\nThe main steps of physical design are listed below. In practice there is not a straightforward progression - considerable iteration is required to ensure all objectives are met simultaneously. This is a difficult problem in its own right, called design closure.\nBULLET::::- Logic synthesis: The RTL is mapped into a gate-level netlist in the target technology of the chip.\nBULLET::::- Floorplanning: The RTL of the chip is assigned to gross regions of the chip, input/output (I/O) pins are assigned and large objects (arrays, cores, etc.) are placed.\nBULLET::::- Placement: The gates in the netlist are assigned to nonoverlapping locations on the die area.\nBULLET::::- Logic/placement refinement: Iterative logical and placement transformations to close performance and power constraints.\nBULLET::::- Clock insertion: Clock signal wiring is (commonly, clock trees) introduced into the design.\nBULLET::::- Routing: The wires that connect the gates in the netlist are added.\nBULLET::::- Postwiring optimization: Performance (timing closure), noise (signal integrity), and yield (Design for manufacturability) violations are removed.\nBULLET::::- Design for manufacturability: The design is modified, where possible, to make it as easy and efficient as possible to produce. This is achieved by adding extra vias or adding dummy metal/diffusion/poly layers wherever possible while complying to the design rules set by the foundry.\nBULLET::::- Final checking: Since errors are expensive, time consuming and hard to spot, extensive error checking is the rule, making sure the mapping to logic was done correctly, and checking that the manufacturing rules were followed faithfully.\nBULLET::::- Tapeout and mask generation: the design data is turned into photomasks in mask data preparation."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

To translate code, it first parses the code and extracts four types of tokens:\nOur translation algorithm is as follows. We (1)  collect all of the target identifiers defined in the codebase and (2) translate them (enforcing that if two identifiers have the same name, they are given the same translation).

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. \nWe segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. \\texttt{camelCaseVariable}, \\texttt{PascalCaseClass}, \\texttt{UPPERCASE\\_CONSTANT}).\nWe thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words \\emph{without} a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\"). \n\nVerb prior:\nThe correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative. \n\nTranslating short identifiers:\nShort variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\". We only translate identifiers which are at least two characters long. This exception has its own edge-case: CJK (Chinese, Japanese Korean) identifiers can be  non-mathematical names even if only a character long."], "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/7": ["In this paper we present a tool for translating a program from one human-language to another to assist in code education, which could reduce the barrier to computer science education for non-English speakers.\nOur human-language code translator was inspired by a desire to make programming more accessible \\cite{brinkman2016applying}.

From the 1k projects 91% of the identifiers were able to be translated.

In one of the most comprehensive meta-analytic summary to date by Weisner and Cronshaw (1988). The authors investigated interview validity as a function of interview format (individual vs board) and degree of structure( structure vs unstructured). Results of this study showed that structured interviews yielded much higher mean corrected validities than unstructured interviews (0.63 vs 0.20), and structured board interviews using consensus ratings had the highest corrected validity (0.64).\n\nIn McDaniel, Whetzel, Schmidt & Maurer's Comprehensive Review and Meta- analysis of the Validity of Interviews (1994) paper, the authors go a step further and include an examination of the validity of three different types of interview content(situational, job-related, and psychological).Their goal was to explore the possibility that validity is a function of the type of content collected.\n\nThey define the three kinds of content as follows \u2013 situational content was described as interview questions that get information on how the interviewee would behave in specific situations presented by the interviewer. For example, a question that asks whether the interviewee would choose to report a coworker for behaving in an unethical way or just let them go. Job related questions, on the other hand, assess the interviewee's past behavior and job-related information. While psychological interviews include questions intended to assess the interviewee's personality traits such as their work ethic, dependability, honesty etc.\n\nThe authors conducted a meta-analysis of all previous studies on the validity of interviews across the three types of content mentioned above. Their results show that for job-performance criteria, situational interviews yield higher mean validity(0.50) than do job-related interviews(0.39) which yield a higher mean validity than do psychology interviews(0.29). This means that when the interview is used to predict job performance, it is best to conduct situational interviews rather than job-related or psychological interviews. On the other hand, when interviews are used to predict an applicant's training performance, the mean validity of job-related interviews(0.36) is somewhat lower than the mean validity of psychological interviews(0.40).\n\nGoing beyond the content of the interview, the authors' analysis of interview validity was extended to include an assessment of how the interview was conducted. Here, two questions emerged \u2013 Are structured interviews more valid than unstructured interviews ? and are board interviews( with more than one interviewer) more valid than individual interviews.\n\nTheir answer to the first question \u2013 Are structured interviews more valid unstructured interviews was that structured interviews, regardless of content, is more valid(0.44) than unstructured interviews(0.33) in predicting job performance criteria. However, when training performance is the criteria, the validity of structured and unstructured interviews are similar (0.34 and 0.36).\n\nAs for the validity of board interviews versus individual interviews, the researchers conducted another meta-analyses comparing the validity of board interviews and individual interviews for job performance criteria. The results show that individual interviews are more valid than board interviews( 0.43 vs 0.32). This is true regardless of whether the individual interview is structured or unstructured.\n\nWhen exploring the variance in interview validity between job performance, training performance, and tenure criteria, the researchers found that the interviews are similar in predictive accuracy for job-performance and training performance( 0.37 vs 0.36). But less predictive for tenure (0.20).\n\nBased on meta-analysis results, cognitive ability tests appear to be among the most valid of all psychological tests and are valid for most occupations. However, these tests tend to do better at predicting training criteria than long term job performance. Cognitive ability tests in general provide the benefit of being generalizable. Hence they can be used across organizations and jobs and have been shown to produce large economic gains for companies that use them (Gatewood & Feild, 1998; Heneman et al., 2000).\n\nBut despite the high validity of cognitive testing, it is less frequently used as selection tools. One main reason is that cognitive ability testing has been demonstrated to produce adverse impact. In general, groups including Hispanics and African-Americans score lower than the general population while other groups including Asian \u2013 Americans score higher (Heneman et al., 2000; Lubenski, 1995). The legal issues with cognitive ability testing were amplified by the supreme court's ruling in the famous 1971 Griggs v. Duke Power case. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that when a selection test produces adverse impact against protected group members the company must be able to defend it by showing that use of the test is a \"business necessity\" for the operation of the business. The courts have held narrow interpretations of business necessity that require companies to show that no other acceptable selection alternative exists (Sovereign, 1999). As a result, many companies abandoned cognitive ability testing ( Steven L. Thomas &Wesley A. Scroggins, 2006).\n\nWhile the utility of cognitive ability testing in selection has been broadly accepted, the utility of personality testing, until relatively recently, has not. Historically, research documenting the low predictive validity and the potential for invasion of privacy based on item content has made its application as selection instruments questionable (Hogan, Hogan, & Roberts, 1996).\n\nBut due to the legal challenges associated with cognitive ability, interest in personality instruments has recently been revived (Schmidt, Ones, & Hunter, 1992). Some have suggested that pairing personality testing with cognitive ability testing may be one means to enhance validity while reducing adverse impact (Ryan,"], "wikipedia-239140": ["Validity is the extent to which a concept, conclusion or measurement is well-founded and likely corresponds accurately to the real world. The word \"valid\" is derived from the Latin validus, meaning strong. This should not be confused with notions of certainty nor necessity. The validity of a measurement tool (for example, a test in education) is considered to be the degree to which the tool measures what it claims to measure. Validity is based on the strength of a collection of different types of evidence (e.g. face validity, construct validity, etc.) described in greater detail below.\nIn psychometrics, validity has a particular application known as test validity: \"the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores\" (\"as entailed by proposed uses of tests\").\nIt is generally accepted that the concept of scientific validity addresses the nature of reality in terms of statistical measures and as such is an epistemological and philosophical issue as well as a question of measurement. The use of the term in logic is narrower, relating to the truth of inferences made from premises. In logic, and therefore as the term is applied to any epistemological claim, validity refers to the consistency of an argument flowing from the premises to the conclusion; as such, the truth of the claim in logic is not only reliant on validity. Rather, an argumentative claim is true if and only if it is both valid and sound. This means the argument flows without contradiction from the premises or the conclusion, and all of the premises and the conclusion correspond to known facts. As such, \"scientific or statistical validity\" is not a deductive claim that is necessarily truth preserving, but is an inductive claim that remains true or false in an undecided manner. This is why \"scientific or statistical validity\" is a claim that is qualified as being either strong or weak in its nature, it is never necessary nor certainly true. This has the effect of making claims of \"scientific or statistical validity\" open to interpretation as to what, in fact, the facts of the matter mean. \nValidity is important because it can help determine what types of tests to use, and help to make sure researchers are using methods that are not only ethical, and cost-effective, but also a method that truly measures the idea or constructs in question."], "wikipedia-5222017": ["The WEI includes five subscores: processor, memory, 2D graphics, 3D graphics, and disk; the basescore is equal to the lowest of the subscores and is not an average of the subscores.

For example, the Aero graphical user interface will not automatically be enabled unless the system has a WEI score of 3 or higher.\nThe WEI can also be used to show which part of a system would be expected to provide the greatest increase in performance when upgraded. For example, a computer with the lowest subscore being its memory, would benefit more from a RAM upgrade than adding a faster hard drive (or any other component).\nDetailed raw performance information, like actual disk bandwidth, can be obtained by invoking codice_1 from the command line. This also allows only specific tests to be re-run. Obtaining the WEI score from the command line is done invoking codice_2, which also updates the value stored in codice_3.

At the time of writing this article, Google Translate uses Neural Machine Translation  \\cite{nmt} to translate pairwise between languages and has become incredibly accurate, at least for languages common on the web \\citep{gnmt}. Further research has been done on transliterating text \\cite{knight1998machine, arbabi1994algorithms}. However, current state-of-the-art methods for text translation fail at translating code. Directly running a translation algorithm on code would fail to distinguish between code syntax and identifiers, would not recognize terms embedded in identifiers e.g. with camel case \\texttt{getElementAt}, and could produce code with one identifier name having different translations on separate lines. As such, current automatic text translation, if ran directly on code, would produce malfunctional code. \\textbf{Code Instruction in Non-English} In 2017, Dasgupta and Hill published seminal work outlining the importance of learning to code in one's own language. They conclude that \"novice users who code with their programming language keywords and environment localized into their home countries' primary language demonstrate new programming concepts at a faster rate than users from the same countries whose interface is in English\" \\cite{dasgupta2017learning}. Since then, there has been a large set of papers expanding on the barriers for non-native English speakers. Guo et al survey over 800 non-English students learning who report on the many challenges that come with not understanding English while coding. \\cite{guo2018non} reinforced by \\cite{dasgupta2018wide, kirkpatrick2011internationalization}. This has led to preliminary work into translating compiler errors \\cite{reestman2019native} and advocation for language-free block free programming \\cite{banerjee2018empowering}. However, while language-free programming is a great step forward for younger students, it doesn't address the needs of CS1 students who program in common programming languages like Python or Java.

In this paper we present a tool for translating a program from one human-language to another to assist in code education, which could reduce the barrier to computer science education for non-English speakers.\nThe main contributions presented in this paper are:\nOur human-language code translator was inspired by a desire to make programming more accessible \\cite{brinkman2016applying}. An accurate and useful translator would enable faster localization of instruction materials and it would allow learners (as well as practitioners) to translate code that they are working with.\nAs programming becomes more of a requisite common knowledge skill, we expect coding education to become open-access to everyone. One barrier to this goal is human language. English is currently the modal language of programming instruction perhaps given that the keywords of most of the popular languages, Java, JavaScript etc, are in English (even including Python and Lua, invented in the Netherlands and Brasil respectively).

They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects (Wikipedia and others). For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia, and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have. The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.\nTranslated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer \"interwiki links\", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.\nA study published by \"PLoS ONE\" in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world.

It supports the growing set of human languages covered by Google Translate and is adaptive to the particular context of source-code. To translate code, it first parses the code and extracts four types of tokens: Our translation algorithm is as follows. We (1) collect all of the target identifiers defined in the codebase and (2) translate them (enforcing that if two identifiers have the same name, they are given the same translation). Once the identifiers are translated we (3) translate the comments preserving structure and references to identifiers. (4) Finally string literals are optionally translated. See Figure \\ref{fig:api} for a highlevel depiction and Figure \\ref{fig:exampleTranslation} for a concrete example. Each of these steps has surprising challenges. In this section we cover the corresponding solutions we developed. The mapping of identifier translations that the tool decides on is preserved to assist any external source which needs to refer to the newly translated identifiers (such as text in a text-book or code in a related project). CodeInternational is implemented in Python. Tokenization is performed using a modified version of \"Javalang\" (for Java) and the \"Parser\" library (for Python). Supporting other programming languages requires a small amount of extra work\\footnote{We expect C, C++ and Javascript to be ready by the camera-ready deadline.}."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-31392996": 1, "wikipedia-13522534": 1, "wikipedia-39483071": 1, "wikipedia-43446010": 1, "wikipedia-56153487": 1, "wikipedia-27201290": 1, "wikipedia-3395624": 1, "wikipedia-39125084": 1, "wikipedia-47544882": 1, "wikipedia-43894656": 1, "arxiv-hep-ph/0202025": 1, "arxiv-1707.08759": 1, "arxiv-0705.0342": 1, "arxiv-1705.09349": 1, "arxiv-quant-ph/9610014": 1, "arxiv-1109.5915": 1, "arxiv-2204.13754": 1, "arxiv-physics/0306036": 1, "arxiv-0710.5590": 1, "arxiv-1310.7044": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/0": 2, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/22": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/14": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/19": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/13": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-31392996": 1, "wikipedia-13522534": 1, "wikipedia-39483071": 1, "wikipedia-43446010": 1, "wikipedia-56153487": 1, "wikipedia-27201290": 1, "wikipedia-3395624": 1, "wikipedia-39125084": 1, "wikipedia-47544882": 1, "wikipedia-43894656": 1, "arxiv-hep-ph/0202025": 1, "arxiv-1707.08759": 1, "arxiv-0705.0342": 1, "arxiv-1705.09349": 1, "arxiv-quant-ph/9610014": 1, "arxiv-1109.5915": 1, "arxiv-2204.13754": 1, "arxiv-physics/0306036": 1, "arxiv-0710.5590": 1, "arxiv-1310.7044": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/0": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/18": 2, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/22": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/14": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/7": 2, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/19": 2, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/13": 2}}}

The tool, which we call CodeInternational, takes in code written in either Java or Python with comments and identifiers written in a human-language and translates the comments and identifiers into another human-language. It supports the growing set of human languages covered by Google Translate and is adaptive to the particular context of source-code. To translate code, it first parses the code and extracts four types of tokens: Our translation algorithm is as follows. We (1) collect all of the target identifiers defined in the codebase and (2) translate them (enforcing that if two identifiers have the same name, they are given the same translation). Once the identifiers are translated we (3) translate the comments preserving structure and references to identifiers. (4) Finally string literals are optionally translated. See Figure \\ref{fig:api} for a highlevel depiction and Figure \\ref{fig:exampleTranslation} for a concrete example. Each of these steps has surprising challenges. In this section we cover the corresponding solutions we developed. The mapping of identifier translations that the tool decides on is preserved to assist any external source which needs to refer to the newly translated identifiers (such as text in a text-book or code in a related project). CodeInternational is implemented in Python. Tokenization is performed using a modified version of \"Javalang\" (for Java) and the \"Parser\" library (for Python). Supporting other programming languages requires a small amount of extra work\\footnote{We expect C, C++ and Javascript to be ready by the camera-ready deadline.}"], "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/14": ["In order to properly translate identifiers, we consider the following:\n\nIdentifier segmentation: Translating an identifier using a tool like Google Translate does not work by default as identifiers are often composed of unsegmented words. For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. We segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. camelCaseVariable, PascalCaseClass, UPPERCASE_CONSTANT). We thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words without a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\"). \n\nVerb prior: The correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. In addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative.\n\nTranslating short identifiers: Short variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\". We only translate identifiers which are at least two characters long.

We note that, in Java, identifiers can be written in any script. \nSurprisingly, the patterns of non-English usage differs substantially when we condition on users \"speaking\" different languages. For example, among the detected Spanish speakers, 87.2\\% percent of users write identifiers in Spanish. On the other hand, among Chinese users only 23.3\\% of users write code with Chinese identifiers (either in Chinese script or ASCII). Figure 1b shows coding patterns conditioned on users speaking different languages. For each language we plot the percent of projects with identifiers in the language against the percent of projects with comments in the language. Languages naturally cluster into three categories: (1) \\textbf{Major-Euro-Latin:} languages with high use of non-English identifier including Spanish, German and French (2) \\textbf{Non-Latin:} languages in non-latin scripts including Russian and Chinese which have low use of non-English identifiers and (3) \\textbf{English-Comment:}  Programmers write their comments in English (> 70\\% of projects only have English comments). This group contains many smaller and non-European languages like Dutch and Bahasa Indonesia. \\~50\\% of projects in this group still uses their L1 language in identifiers.\nThe use of identifiers in local language (as opposed to English) is very clearly split on whether languages use the Latin alphabet. On average 82\\% of projects from users speak languages with different scripts like Chinese, Korean, or Russian have only English identifiers, compared to 12\\% of projects from Latin alphabet users ($p < 0.0001$).

Among comments languages differ greatly: 99\\% of Chinese projects have non ASCII comments compared to only 53\\% of Spanish. As an example a comment above a method specifies in script that it is calculating the Fibonacci sequence however the method name (an identifier) is transliterated \"//\\hspace{-3mm}\\begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{gbsn}\u6590\u6ce2\u90a3\u5951\\end{CJK*}\" however the code uses a transliteration of the phonemes in the script \"public int feibonaqie(int n)\".

To translate code, it first parses the code and extracts four types of tokens:\nOur translation algorithm is as follows. We (1)  collect all of the target identifiers defined in the codebase and (2) translate them (enforcing that if two identifiers have the same name, they are given the same translation). Once the identifiers are translated we (3) translate the comments preserving structure and references to identifiers. (4) Finally string literals are optionally translated.

From the 1k projects 91\\% of the identifiers were able to be translated. The nine percent that were not able to be translated were mainly abbreviations (such as users who named a variable frac instead of fraction or pct instead of percent). This is an opportunity for future work. Overall the results paint the picture of a functioning tool which is ready for use."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-5679554": 1, "wikipedia-18704901": 1, "wikipedia-239140": 1, "wikipedia-866638": 1, "wikipedia-682774": 1, "wikipedia-1522933": 1, "wikipedia-20156916": 1, "wikipedia-59146042": 1, "wikipedia-7018809": 1, "wikipedia-35204369": 1, "arxiv-2302.05883": 1, "arxiv-2202.05453": 1, "arxiv-1909.03953": 1, "arxiv-1703.09400": 1, "arxiv-2402.09858": 1, "arxiv-1906.12199": 1, "arxiv-1603.08701": 1, "arxiv-1909.11042": 1, "arxiv-2303.05978": 1, "arxiv-2207.00156": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/2": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/18": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/13": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-5679554": 1, "wikipedia-18704901": 1, "wikipedia-239140": 1, "wikipedia-866638": 1, "wikipedia-682774": 1, "wikipedia-1522933": 1, "wikipedia-20156916": 1, "wikipedia-59146042": 1, "wikipedia-7018809": 1, "wikipedia-35204369": 1, "arxiv-2302.05883": 1, "arxiv-2202.05453": 1, "arxiv-1909.03953": 1, "arxiv-1703.09400": 1, "arxiv-2402.09858": 1, "arxiv-1906.12199": 1, "arxiv-1603.08701": 1, "arxiv-1909.11042": 1, "arxiv-2303.05978": 1, "arxiv-2207.00156": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/2": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/18": 3, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/9": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/13": 1}}}

This does not match the distribution of non-English in web content (55% English) with both major and minor languages underrepresented. For example the prevalence of Spanish on GitHub (2.1%) is about half of webcontent (5.1%) and further trails native speakers (7.8% of the worlds population). Github does not present a random sample of programs written in the world, and we consider the relevant confounds this introduces.

We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words \\emph{without} a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\").\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Verb prior:}\nThe correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative.

Optionally, integrating with automatic text-to-speech (e.g. \\citep{wavenet-text2speech}) could allow students learn English pronunciation of code components.

Yes  \n2. Wikipedia pages related to programming, software development, or code translation (e.g., \"Code migration,\" \"Programming paradigms,\" or \"Compiler\") often cover common challenges in these areas. These may include specific issues like semantic discrepancies, differences in programming paradigms, performance trade-offs, or compatibility issues, which could be interpreted as 'potential pitfalls' in code translation.", "wikipedia-639009": ["Organizations and teams implementing agile software development often face difficulties transitioning from more traditional methods such as waterfall development, such as teams having an agile process forced on them. These are often termed \"agile anti-patterns\" or more commonly \"agile smells\". Below are some common examples:\n\nLack of overall product design.\nA goal of agile software development is to focus more on producing working software and less on documentation. This is in contrast to waterfall models where the process is often highly controlled and minor changes to the system require significant revision of supporting documentation. However, this does not justify completely doing without any analysis or design at all. Failure to pay attention to design can cause a team to proceed rapidly at first but then to have significant rework required as they attempt to scale up the system. One of the key features of agile software development is that it is iterative. When done correctly design emerges as the system is developed and commonalities and opportunities for re-use are discovered.\n\nAdding stories to an iteration in progress.\nIn agile software development, \"stories\" (similar to use case descriptions) are typically used to define requirements and an \"iteration\" is a short period of time during which the team commits to specific goals. Adding stories to an iteration in progress is detrimental to a good flow of work. These should be added to the product backlog and prioritized for a subsequent iteration or in rare cases the iteration could be cancelled.\nThis does not mean that a story cannot expand. Teams must deal with new information, which may produce additional tasks for a story. If the new information prevents the story from being completed during the iteration, then it should be carried over to a subsequent iteration. However, it should be prioritized against all remaining stories, as the new information may have changed the story's original priority.\n\nLack of sponsor support.\nAgile software development is often implemented as a grassroots effort in organizations by software development teams trying to optimize their development processes and ensure consistency in the software development life cycle. By not having sponsor support, teams may face difficulties and resistance from business partners, other development teams and management. Additionally, they may suffer without appropriate funding and resources. This increases the likelihood of failure.\n\nInsufficient training.\nA survey performed by VersionOne found respondents cited insufficient training as the most significant cause for failed agile implementations Teams have fallen into the trap of assuming the reduced processes of agile software development compared to other methodologies such as waterfall means that there are no actual rules for agile software development.\n\nProduct owner role is not properly filled.\nThe product owner is responsible for representing the business in the development activity and is often the most demanding role.\nA common mistake is to have the product owner role filled by someone from the development team. This requires the team to make its own decisions on prioritization without real feedback from the business. They try to solve business issues internally or delay work as they reach outside the team for direction. This often leads to distraction and a breakdown in collaboration.\n\nTeams are not focused.\nAgile software development requires teams to meet product commitments, which means they should focus only on work for that product. However, team members who appear to have spare capacity are often expected to take on other work, which makes it difficult for them to help complete the work to which their team had committed.\n\nExcessive preparation/planning.\nTeams may fall into the trap of spending too much time preparing or planning. This is a common trap for teams less familiar with agile software development where the teams feel obliged to have a complete understanding and specification of all stories. Teams should be prepared to move forward only with those stories in which they have confidence, then during the iteration continue to discover and prepare work for subsequent iterations (often referred to as backlog refinement or grooming).\n\nProblem-solving in the daily standup.\nA daily standup should be a focused, timely meeting where all team members disseminate information. If problem-solving occurs, it often can only involve certain team members and potentially is not the best use of the entire team's time. If during the daily standup the team starts diving into problem-solving, it should be set aside until a sub-team can discuss, usually immediately after the standup completes.\n\nAssigning tasks.\nOne of the intended benefits of agile software development is to empower the team to make choices, as they are closest to the problem. Additionally, they should make choices as close to implementation as possible, to use more timely information in the decision. If team members are assigned tasks by others or too early in the process, the benefits of localized and timely decision making can be lost.\nBeing assigned work also constrains team members into certain roles (for example, team member A must always do the database work), which limits opportunities for cross-training. Team members themselves can choose to take on tasks that stretch their abilities and provide cross-training opportunities.\n\nScrum master as a contributor.\nAnother common pitfall is for a scrum master to act as a contributor. While not prohibited by the Scrum methodology, the scrum master needs to ensure they have the capacity to act in the role of scrum master first and not working on development tasks. A scrum master's role is to facilitate the process rather than create the product.\nHaving the scrum master also multitasking may result in too many context switches to be productive. Additionally, as a scrum master is responsible for ensuring roadblocks are removed so that the team can make forward progress, the benefit gained by individual tasks moving forward may not outweigh roadblocks that are deferred due to lack of capacity.\n\nLack of test automation.\nDue to the iterative nature of agile development, multiple rounds of testing are often needed. Automated testing helps reduce the impact of repeated unit, integration, and regression tests and frees developers and testers to focus on higher value work.\nTest automation also supports continued refactoring required by iterative software development. Allowing a developer to quickly run tests to confirm refactoring has not modified the functionality of the application may reduce the workload and increase confidence that cleanup efforts have not introduced new defects.\n\nAllowing technical debt to build up.\nFocusing on delivering new functionality may result in increased technical debt. The team must allow themselves time for defect remediation and refactoring. Technical debt hinders planning abilities by increasing the amount of unscheduled work as production defects distract the team from further progress.\nAs the system evolves it is important to refactor as entropy of the system naturally increases. Over time the lack of constant maintenance causes increasing defects and development costs.\n\nAttempting to take on too much in an iteration.\nA common misconception is that agile software development allows continuous change, however an iteration backlog is an agreement of what work can be completed during an iteration. Having too much work-in-progress (WIP) results in inefficiencies such as context-switching and queueing. The team must avoid feeling pressured into taking on additional work.\n\nFixed time, resources, scope, and quality.\nAgile software development fixes time (iteration duration), quality, and ideally resources in advance (though maintaining fixed resources may be difficult if developers are often pulled away from tasks to handle production incidents), while the scope remains variable. The customer or product owner often push for a fixed scope for an iteration. However, teams should be reluctant to commit to the locked time,"], "wikipedia-8735708": ["Because we are dealing with a multimedia product, the challenges translators have to face are also multimedia. Within the same project they have to deal with a wide variety of issues like reproducing the oral quality of dialogue in writing, lip-synching for dubbing, space and time constraints for subtitling, number of characters for subtitle, UI, etc.\n...\nSpeech delivered by game characters where registers, accents, and idiosyncrasies have to be conveyed into other languages. Sometimes an extra column is included to add inflection comments for the dubbing director. A part of the dubbing script may include atmospheric utterances also in a spoken form. Many games might feature characters talking or reacting to players\u2019 actions. These characters may have little or no relevance to the plot, but their inclusion and to the immersion of the player in the virtual world. No synchronisation is normally required, but orality has to be maintained.\n...\nOral text in written form. The dubbing script may be applied directly in the subtitling of the game, which results in cluttered and fast subtitles with no character limit per line, nor lines per subtitle. In addition, translators may be faced with the fact that not all languages allow for the same freedom when writing subtitles.

This is in contrast to waterfall models where the process is often highly controlled and minor changes to the system require significant revision of supporting documentation. However, this does not justify completely doing without any analysis or design at all. Failure to pay attention to design can cause a team to proceed rapidly at first but then to have significant rework required as they attempt to scale up the system. One of the key features of agile software development is that it is iterative. When done correctly design emerges as the system is developed and commonalities and opportunities for re-use are discovered.\nSection::::Experience and adoption.:Common agile software development pitfalls.:Adding stories to an iteration in progress.\nIn agile software development, \"stories\" (similar to use case descriptions) are typically used to define requirements and an \"iteration\" is a short period of time during which the team commits to specific goals. Adding stories to an iteration in progress is detrimental to a good flow of work. These should be added to the product backlog and prioritized for a subsequent iteration or in rare cases the iteration could be cancelled.\nThis does not mean that a story cannot expand. Teams must deal with new information, which may produce additional tasks for a story. If the new information prevents the story from being completed during the iteration, then it should be carried over to a subsequent iteration. However, it should be prioritized against all remaining stories, as the new information may have changed the story's original priority.\nSection::::Experience and adoption.:Common agile software development pitfalls.:Lack of sponsor support.\nAgile software development is often implemented as a grassroots effort in organizations by software development teams trying to optimize their development processes and ensure consistency in the software development life cycle. By not having sponsor support, teams may face difficulties and resistance from business partners, other development teams and management. Additionally, they may suffer without appropriate funding and resources. This increases the likelihood of failure.\nSection::::Experience and adoption.:Common agile software development pitfalls.:Insufficient training.\nA survey performed by VersionOne found respondents cited insufficient training as the most significant cause for failed agile implementations Teams have fallen into the trap of assuming the reduced processes of agile software development compared to other methodologies such as waterfall means that there are no actual rules for agile software development. \nSection::::Experience and adoption.:Common agile software development pitfalls.:Product owner role is not properly filled.\nThe product owner is responsible for representing the business in the development activity and is often the most demanding role.\nA common mistake is to have the product owner role filled by someone from the development team. This requires the team to make its own decisions on prioritization without real feedback from the business. They try to solve business issues internally or delay work as they reach outside the team for direction. This often leads to distraction and a breakdown in collaboration.\nSection::::Experience and adoption.:Common agile software development pitfalls.:Teams are not focused.\nAgile software development requires teams to meet product commitments, which means they should focus only on work for that product. However, team members who appear to have spare capacity are often expected to take on other work, which makes it difficult for them to help complete the work to which their team had committed.\nSection::::Experience and adoption.:Common agile software development pitfalls.:Excessive preparation/planning.\nTeams may fall into the trap of spending too much time preparing or planning. This is a common trap for teams less familiar with agile software development where the teams feel obliged to have a complete understanding and specification of all stories. Teams should be prepared to move forward only with those stories in which they have confidence, then during the iteration continue to discover and prepare work for subsequent iterations (often referred to as backlog refinement or grooming).\nSection::::Experience and adoption.:Common agile software development pitfalls.:Problem-solving in the daily standup.\nA daily standup should be a focused, timely meeting where all team members disseminate information. If problem-solving occurs, it often can only involve certain team members and potentially is not the best use of the entire team's time. If during the daily standup the team starts diving into problem-solving, it should be set aside until a sub-team can discuss, usually immediately after the standup completes. \nSection::::Experience and adoption.:Common agile software development pitfalls.:Assigning tasks.\nOne of the intended benefits of agile software development is to empower the team to make choices, as they are closest to the problem. Additionally, they should make choices as close to implementation as possible, to use more timely information in the decision. If team members are assigned tasks by others or too early in the process, the benefits of localized and timely decision making can be lost.\nBeing assigned work also constrains team members into certain roles (for example, team member A must always do the database work), which limits opportunities for cross-training. Team members themselves can choose to take on tasks that stretch their abilities and provide cross-training opportunities.\nSection::::Experience and adoption.:Common agile software development pitfalls.:Scrum master as a contributor.\nAnother common pitfall is for a scrum master to act as a contributor. While not prohibited by the Scrum methodology, the scrum master needs to ensure they have the capacity to act in the role of scrum master first and not working on development tasks. A scrum master's role is to facilitate the process rather than create the product.\nHaving the scrum master also multitasking may result in too many context switches to be productive. Additionally, as a scrum master is responsible for ensuring roadblocks are removed so that the team can make forward progress, the benefit gained by individual tasks moving forward may not outweigh roadblocks that are deferred due to lack of capacity.\nSection::::Experience and adoption.:Common agile software development pitfalls.:Lack of test automation.\nDue to the iterative nature of agile development, multiple rounds of testing are often needed. Automated testing helps reduce the impact of repeated unit, integration, and regression tests and frees developers and testers to focus on higher value work.\nTest automation also supports continued refactoring required by iterative software development. Allowing a developer to quickly run tests to confirm refactoring has not modified the functionality of the application may reduce the workload and increase confidence that cleanup efforts have not introduced new defects.\nSection::::Experience and adoption.:Common agile software development pitfalls.:Allowing technical debt to build up.\nFocusing on delivering new functionality may result in increased technical debt. The team must allow themselves time for defect remediation and refactoring. Technical debt hinders planning abilities by increasing the amount of unscheduled work as production defects distract the team from further progress.\nAs the system evolves it is important to refactor as entropy of the system naturally increases. Over time the lack of constant maintenance causes increasing defects and development costs.\nSection::::Experience and adoption.:Common agile software development pitfalls.:Attempting to take on too much in an iteration.\nA common misconception is that agile software development allows continuous change, however an iteration backlog is an agreement of what work can be completed during an iteration. Having too much work-in-progress (WIP) results in inefficiencies such as context-switching and queueing. The team must avoid feeling pressured into taking on additional work.\nSection::::Experience and adoption.:Common agile software development pitfalls.:Fixed time, resources, scope, and quality.\nAgile software development fixes time (iteration duration), quality, and ideally resources in advance (though maintaining fixed resources may be difficult if developers are often pulled away from tasks to handle production incidents), while the scope remains variable. The customer or product owner often push for a fixed scope for an iteration. However, teams should be reluctant to commit to the locked time,"], "wikipedia-4183932": ["Writing P/Invoke wrappers can be difficult and error prone.

We observed that most Java code with human languages that have non-ascii scripts like Kanji, Devanagari, or even Spanish accents like \u00f1, will have been \"transliterated\" into ascii. The Java Language Specification states that, \"letters and digits (in identifiers) may be drawn from the entire Unicode character set, which supports most writing scripts\". This specification is not widely known, and even if Java supports non-ascii , there can be complexities of file encodings across different operating systems.\n\nWe find that regardless of L1 language most users transliterate identifiers: among L1 Chinese speakers, 93\\% of projects have identifiers which are only written in ASCII. Similarly in Spanish 88\\% of projects have only ASCII identifiers. As a concrete example, in GitHub Java code \"numero\" is 3.8x more common than \"n\u00famero\". Among comments languages differ greatly: 99\\% of Chinese projects have non ASCII comments compared to only 53\\% of Spanish. As an example a comment above a method specifies in script that it is calculating the Fibonacci sequence however the method name (an identifier) is transliterated \"//\\hspace{-3mm}\\begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{gbsn}\u6590\u6ce2\u90a3\u5951\\end{CJK*}\" however the code uses a transliteration of the phonemes in the script \"public int feibonaqie(int n)\".

We segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. \\texttt{camelCaseVariable}, \\texttt{PascalCaseClass}, \\texttt{UPPERCASE\\_CONSTANT}). We thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words \\emph{without} a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\").\n\n\\textbf{Verb prior:} The correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. In addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative.\n\n\\textbf{Translating short identifiers:} Short variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\".

The Unicode specification assigns a \"directional type\" to each character to inform text processors how sequences of characters should be ordered on the page.\nWhile lexical characters (that is, letters) are normally specific to a single writing script, some symbols and punctuation marks are used across many writing scripts.

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. We segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. \\texttt{camelCaseVariable}, \\texttt{PascalCaseClass}, \\texttt{UPPERCASE\\_CONSTANT}). We thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\".

Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. In addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative.

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. \nWe segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. \\texttt{camelCaseVariable}, \\texttt{PascalCaseClass}, \\texttt{UPPERCASE\\_CONSTANT}).\nWe thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\".

Translanguaging is an extension of the concept of languaging, the discursive practices of language speakers, but with an additional feature of using multiple languages, often simultaneously. It is a dynamic process in which multilingual language users navigate complex social and cognitive demands through strategic employment of multiple languages.\n\nIn an educational setting, translanguaging can be controlled by both the student and the teacher. It maximizes the child's bilingual ability and is being used across the world. For instance, a teacher can develop a lesson plan using English as the medium of instruction and another language as the medium of discussion. This then allows the student to, in response, use each language for different domains within the classroom. Translanguaging, however, is not only a tool used in the classroom, but a function of language experienced by multilingual speakers, who constitute most language communities in the world.\n\nScholars argue that translanguaging functions as an emancipation from the adverse second language acquisition pedagogies of the 20th century. They believe that translanguaging gives multilingual students an advantage within educational systems because it (1) promotes a more thorough understanding of content; (2) helps the development of the weaker language for bilingual or multilingual speakers; (3) fosters home-to-school links within language use; and (4) integrates fluent speakers with early learners, thus expediting the language learning process."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

To develop a theory of non-English code, and inform our translation decisions, we conduct a study of public code repositories on GitHub. The study is to the best of our knowledge the first on human-language in code and covers  2.9 million Java repositories.

The main contributions presented in this paper are: Our human-language code translator was inspired by a desire to make programming more accessible \\cite{brinkman2016applying}. An accurate and useful translator would enable faster localization of instruction materials and it would allow learners (as well as practitioners) to translate code that they are working with. As programming becomes more of a requisite common knowledge skill, we expect coding education to become open-access to everyone. One barrier to this goal is human language. English is currently the modal language of programming instruction perhaps given that the keywords of most of the popular languages, Java, JavaScript etc, are in English (even including Python and Lua, invented in the Netherlands and Brasil respectively). However, a majority of the world, estimated in 2008 at 80\\%, can't ``use\" English for communication and substantially more don't speak English as their L1 language (the technical term for one's arterial language, aka, mother tongue) \\cite{crystal2008two}. Should the more than 6 billion non-English speakers learn to program in their native language or in English? This question is debated, which we address in the discussion. We take the position that whether or not code instruction is in English, if students do not speak English as their L1 language, their code education would benefit from the ability to translate Code between their preferred language and English."], "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/13": ["The GitHub analysis is coherent with the contemporary narrative: there are perhaps hundreds of millions of learners who will not speak English as their L1 language. For those learners, teachers need a tool to translate code so they can give examples with less congitive load. Similarly students need a tool to understand the non-English code they encounter. Finally, to a growing extent English speakers will begin to interact with code written in other languages.\nTo adress this need,\nwe \ndesigned a tool to help\nprogrammers, regardless of their spoken language, access code in many languages.\nThe tool, which we call CodeInternational, takes in code written in either Java or Python with comments and identifiers written in a human-language and translates the comments and identifiers into another human-language. It supports the growing set of human languages covered by Google Translate and is adaptive to the particular context of source-code. To translate code, it first parses the code and extracts four types of tokens:\nOur translation algorithm is as follows. We (1)  collect all of the target identifiers defined in the codebase and (2) translate them (enforcing that if two identifiers have the same name, they are given the same translation). Once the identifiers are translated we (3) translate the comments preserving structure and references to identifiers. (4) Finally string literals are optionally translated. See Figure \\ref{fig:api} for a highlevel depiction and Figure \\ref{fig:exampleTranslation} for a concrete example. Each of these steps has surprising challenges. In this section we cover the corresponding solutions we developed. The mapping of identifier translations that the tool decides on is preserved to assist any external source which needs to refer to the newly translated identifiers (such as text in a text-book or code in a related project)."], "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/19": ["Our motivation for developing an automatic human-language code translation tool was to support education for non-English speakers.

Karel has been the inspiration for assignments on platforms such as Code.org and CodeHS and is a staple of the first weeks of CS1 \\cite{becker2001teaching}. \nWe translated a Karel reader in Python and Java to 100 languages. The translated web-reader is free to use, and is hosted at [redacted]. At time of publication the reader has been public (without advertising) and has already been used by over 3,000 people from 50 countries. \nWith permission from Eric Roberts, we first made an eBook version of his Karel reader and simplified the English used \\cite{ericson2016identifying}.

The primary reason for this intuitive: the cognitive-load of learning to program is already high. Moreover, if students learn coding using their L1 language and enjoy it, they become intrinsically motivated to learn English, knowing that English would broaden their access to learning material (learning earning a language, with no short-term motives, could be dull especially for young students).

Students could improve their English through coding, e.g. by placing English code against their L1 code, side-by-side.\nThe primary reason for this intuitive: the cognitive-load of learning to program is already high. Moreover, if students learn coding using their L1 language and enjoy it, they become intrinsically motivated to learn English, knowing that English would broaden their access to learning material (learning earning a language, with no short-term motives, could be dull  especially for young students). In this context CodeInternational can help students who are interacting with libraries in English. Perhaps more importantly our tool can help teachers rapidly develop localized content that builds off English content. The alternative: manual-translation of API, code-examples and website text, can be a huge barrier to translating material. Finally, our tool builds off GoogleTranslate, which is high accurate, but charges \\$1 per 50,000 characters.

Optionally, integrating with automatic text-to-speech (e.g. \\citep{wavenet-text2speech}) could allow students learn English pronunciation of code components. Moreover, one remaining feature in automatic human-translation of code is identifier consistency: if two identifiers have specific terms in common, eg getHeight, setHeight, we would like the translation of \"height\" to be consistent. While they are often consistent in our work, it is not enforced.

In this paper we present a tool for translating a program from one human-language to another to assist in code education, which could reduce the barrier to computer science education for non-English speakers.\nThe main contributions presented in this paper are:\nOur human-language code translator was inspired by a desire to make programming more accessible \\cite{brinkman2016applying}. An accurate and useful translator would enable faster localization of instruction materials and it would allow learners (as well as practitioners) to translate code that they are working with.\nAs programming becomes more of a requisite common knowledge skill, we expect coding education to become open-access to everyone. One barrier to this goal is human language. English is currently the modal language of programming instruction perhaps given that the keywords of most of the popular languages, Java, JavaScript etc, are in English (even including Python and Lua, invented in the Netherlands and Brasil respectively). However, a majority of the world, estimated in 2008 at  80\\%, can't ``use\" English for communication  and substantially more don't speak English as their L1 language (the technical term for one's arterial language, aka, mother tongue)  \\cite{crystal2008two}. Should the more than 6 billion non-English speakers learn to program in their native language or in English? This question is debated, which we address in the discussion. \nWe take the position that whether or not code instruction is in English, if students do not speak English as their L1 language, their code education would benefit from the ability to translate Code between their preferred language and English."], "paper/38/1909.04556/paper.jsonl/10": ["The use of non-English in identifiers and comments is large for the population of users who we define as non-English \"speakers\" (those who use non-English in their git-commit messages). 90\\% of users who use a non-English language in the commit messages also use that language in their comments or as identifiers. We note that, in Java, identifiers can be written in any script. Surprisingly, the patterns of non-English usage differs substantially when we condition on users \"speaking\" different languages. For example, among the detected Spanish speakers, 87.2\\% percent of users write identifiers in Spanish. On the other hand, among Chinese users only 23.3\\% of users write code with Chinese identifiers (either in Chinese script or ASCII). Figure 1b shows coding patterns conditioned on users speaking different languages.

Finally, to a growing extent English speakers will begin to interact with code written in other languages.\nTo adress this need,\nwe \ndesigned a tool to help\nprogrammers, regardless of their spoken language, access code in many languages.\nThe tool, which we call CodeInternational, takes in code written in either Java or Python with comments and identifiers written in a human-language and translates the comments and identifiers into another human-language. It supports the growing set of human languages covered by Google Translate and is adaptive to the particular context of source-code. To translate code, it first parses the code and extracts four types of tokens:\nOur translation algorithm is as follows. We (1)  collect all of the target identifiers defined in the codebase and (2) translate them (enforcing that if two identifiers have the same name, they are given the same translation). Once the identifiers are translated we (3) translate the comments preserving structure and references to identifiers. (4) Finally string literals are optionally translated. See Figure \\ref{fig:api} for a highlevel depiction and Figure \\ref{fig:exampleTranslation} for a concrete example. Each of these steps has surprising challenges. In this section we cover the corresponding solutions we developed. The mapping of identifier translations that the tool decides on is preserved to assist any external source which needs to refer to the newly translated identifiers (such as text in a text-book or code in a related project).\nCodeInternational is implemented in Python. Tokenization is performed using a modified version of \"Javalang\" (for Java) and the \"Parser\" library (for Python).

We analyzed Java repositories on GitHub, the largest host of source code in the world, where 1.1 million unique users host 2.9 million public Java projects. We downloaded and analyzed the human language\nused for writing comments (in Java code), naming identifiers (method and variable names), and writing  \\textit{git commit} messages.\nWe focused on Java code as it is both one of the most popular source-code languages on GitHub and in the classroom.  \nA selection of results from this study are that:\nThis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first analysis of the human languages on GitHub. See Figure \\ref{fig:lang-stats} for an overview.\nUsers on GitHub do not state their L1 (arterial) language. While a subset of users optionally state their country this is neither common nor reliable. To estimate a user's preferred language we use the language that they use in the git commit message. To find subsets of users who speak a given language, we search for all users who write git commits in that language. We observe that, especially in personal projects, users write commit messages in their L1 language at a higher rate than comments or identifiers. To identify languages we use Google Language Detect which is highly accurate (more so for common internet languages) and can identify languages with non-Roman Alphabet text which has been transliterated, for example it can detect both\\begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{gbsn}\\hspace{-3mm}\u7b97\u6cd5\\end{CJK*} the Chinese characters for ``algorithm\" and \"suanfa\", the Mandarin transliteration, as Chinese\\footnote{Google Translate provides a confidence for its language detection.

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. We segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. camelCaseVariable, PascalCaseClass, UPPERCASE_CONSTANT). We thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\".

As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. \nIn addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative.

For example: getFavoriteNumber is readable to a human as \"get favorite number\" but is not parsable by an online translator. We segment identifiers using naming conventions  (e.g. camelCaseVariable, PascalCaseClass, UPPERCASE_CONSTANT). We thus segment identifiers into phrases which we feed into an automatic translator. We then recombine the translated phrase using the original casing convention. For example, to translate the method name identifier \"turnAround\" into Spanish: \"turnAround\" is segmented into \"turn around\" which is translated into \"media vuelta\" which is formatted into the original camelCase \"mediaVuelta\". Advances in artificial intelligence for word segmentation enable a future version of this tool to break up words without a given segmentation (eg \"turnaround\").\n\nVerb prior: The correct translation for a phrase can be ambiguous, especially without context. As an example the method \"move\" translated into Spanish could be translated into a noun (\"movimiento\", movement) or a verb (\"moverse\"). For method identifiers there is an implicit context that an action is being performed. We incorporate this context by placing a prior on the first word being a verb. Thus, for example, when we translate \"move()\" into Spanish we chose \"moverse()\" instead of \"movimiento()\", the noun movement, as Google suggests. In addition to knowing the translations of methods should start with verbs, we also have a select number of reasonable tenses for the verb: infinitive (eg \"toMove\"), third person present (eg \"moves\" as in \"he moves\") and imperative (eg \"move\"). In most languages, including English, we translate verbs with a prior that they be the imperative tense. In English you would expect a method to be \"getObject()\" the imperative. However some languages, especially Romance languages, use the infinitive of the verb: as an example, \"obtener\" the infinitive of \"obtain\" is 200x more common on GitHub then \"obtenga\" the imperative.\n\nTranslating short identifiers: Short variable names that are used for mathematical symbols or as iterators should not be translated. This is especially important to pay attention to for the cannonical for loop identifier \"i\". For example translating the code \"for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)\" into Spanish should not produce \"for(int yo = 0; yo < 10; yo++)\" even though \"yo\" is the translation of the pronoun \"I\". We only translate identifiers which are at least two characters long.

Over the years, some of them bleed into larger namespaces (as people interact in ways they formerly hadn't, e.g., cross-border trade, scientific collaboration, military alliance, and general cultural interconnection or assimilation). When such dissemination happens, the limitations of the original naming convention, which had formerly been latent and moot, become painfully apparent, often necessitating retronymy, synonymity, translation/transcoding, and so on. Such limitations generally accompany the shift away from the original context to the broader one. Typically the system shows implicit context (context was formerly assumed, and narrow), lack of capacity (e.g., low number of possible IDs, reflecting the outmoded narrow context), lack of extensibility (no features defined and reserved against future needs), and lack of specificity and disambiguating capability (related to the context shift, where longstanding uniqueness encounters novel nonuniqueness). Within computer science, this problem is called naming collision. The story of the origination and expansion of the CODEN system provides a good case example in a recent-decades, technical-nomenclature context. The capitalization variations seen with specific designators reveals an instance of this problem occurring in natural languages, where the proper\u00a0noun/common\u00a0noun distinction (and its complications) must be dealt with.

We observe that, especially in personal projects, users write commit messages in their L1 language at a higher rate than comments or identifiers. To identify languages we use Google Language Detect which is highly accurate (more so for common internet languages) and can identify languages with non-Roman Alphabet text which has been transliterated, for example it can detect both\\begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{gbsn}\\hspace{-3mm}\u7b97\u6cd5\\end{CJK*} the Chinese characters for ``algorithm\" and \"suanfa\", the Mandarin transliteration, as Chinese\\footnote{Google Translate provides a confidence for its language detection.
