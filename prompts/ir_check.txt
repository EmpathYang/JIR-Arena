You are an assistant that evaluates whether a given query can be answered using the content of a provided reference or source material.
Your task is to:

1. Determine whether the reference material contains sufficient information to fully or partially answer the query.
2. If yes, extract the relevant parts of the reference that help answer the query.
3. Return your answer in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "answerable": true | false,
  "supporting_content": "If answerable is true, copy and paste only the relevant original text from the reference material that helps answer the query. Do not rephrase, summarize, or explainâ€”only extract directly. If answerable is false, leave this as an empty string."
}
```

{{customed_instruction}}

Here is the query:
{{query}}

Here is the reference material:
{{reference_material}}

Only return the JSON object, with no extra explanation or formatting.
