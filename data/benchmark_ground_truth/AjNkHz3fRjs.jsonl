Three models trained on this dataset (Chronos, TimesFM, MOMENT) perform best, especially for shorter durations. An interesting observation arises with the Uni2TS model, which approaches the performance of the others as the duration increases though it has not seen this data before. This phenomenon may occur because the data is resampled as the duration increases, resulting in a dataset that differs slightly from the original training data sampled every 15 minutes. Consequently, Uni2TS manages to close the performance gap. Comparing statistical models with foundation models, we observed that BestFit outperforms models that have not been trained on the UCI dataset (TimeGPT and Uni2TS) on \ud835\udc36 = 48 and 72. Besides, AutoARIMA and BestFit outperform LagLlama consistently despite LagLlama being trained on the dataset.\n\nSwitching to the Smart* electricity dataset (shown in Table 3 (b)) reveals a shift in model performance. The number of steps is not strictly different for varying durations, as data is resampled for longer periods, so performance discrepancies reflect behavioral characteristics. Evaluated on the Smart* dataset, Chronos loses its leading position to TimesFM. MOMENT and TimeGPT are comparable in terms of absolute performance, following TimesFM and AutoARIMA. Other FMs perform worse, and Uni2TS shows large errors due to outliers. Regarding statistical models, overall, AutoARIMA performs consistently close to the best TSFM TimesFM, BestFit outperforms three foundation models, and S-ARIMA outperforms two foundation models. Compared to the observations in the UCI dataset, the considerably larger errors of TSFMs suggest the challenging predictability of Smart* and the limited generalizability of TSFMs, narrowing the performance gap with statistical models.\n\nThe ecobee dataset presents a more diverse set of results (Ta-ble 3(c)), with statistical models outperforming others for shorter durations. As the duration increases, temperature variations tend to smooth out, where TSFMs seem to perform better. Nonetheless, AutoARIMA remains competitive, nearly matching the best-performing forecasting models. When comparing MOMENT, TimeGPT, and TimesFM, we find that TimesFM excels in long-duration predictions, whereas MOMENT and TimeGPT perform best during moderate durations where temperature changes are less variable. This nuanced performance indicates the importance of considering duration-specific characteristics when evaluating model efficacy.\n\nIn summary, models that have been trained using the UCI dataset, such as Chronos, TimesFM, and MOMENT, demonstrated superior forecasting abilities on the same dataset.

In order to elicit knowledge from the PLMs efficiently, Zecoler casts the downstream tasks to the same form of pre-training objectives by inserting train-able prompts into the original input. These prompts can guide PLMs on how to generate better results. Subsequently, we employ the prompt tuning technique to search for the optimal prompts for PLMs automatically.

Unlike language models that leverage contextual cues such as syntax and semantics, time-series data often lacks this information, complicating pattern recognition. Additionally, the variability in time-series data, driven by factors like physical processes and sensor characteristics, adds complexity. To enhance robustness, TSFMs need to incorporate auxiliary information or undergo fine-tuning to account for this diversity."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Comparing statistical models with foundation models, we observed that BestFit outperforms models that have not been trained on the UCI dataset (TimeGPT and Uni2TS) on \ud835\udc36 = 48 and 72. Besides, AutoARIMA and BestFit outperform LagLlama consistently despite LagLlama being trained on the dataset.\nSwitching to the Smart* electricity dataset (shown in Table 3 (b)) reveals a shift in model performance. The number of steps is not strictly different for varying durations, as data is resampled for longer periods, so performance discrepancies reflect behavioral characteristics. Evaluated on the Smart* dataset, Chronos loses its leading position to TimesFM. MOMENT and TimeGPT are comparable in terms of absolute performance, following TimesFM and AutoARIMA. Other FMs perform worse, and Uni2TS shows large errors due to outliers. Regarding statistical models, overall, AutoARIMA performs consistently close to the best TSFM TimesFM, BestFit outperforms three foundation models, and S-ARIMA outperforms two foundation models. Compared to the observations in the UCI dataset, the considerably larger errors of TSFMs suggest the challenging predictability of Smart* and the limited generalizability of TSFMs, narrowing the performance gap with statistical models.\nThe ecobee dataset presents a more diverse set of results (Ta-ble 3(c)), with statistical models outperforming others for shorter durations. As the duration increases, temperature variations tend to smooth out, where TSFMs seem to perform better. Nonetheless, AutoARIMA remains competitive, nearly matching the best-performing forecasting models. When comparing MOMENT, TimeGPT, and TimesFM, we find that TimesFM excels in long-duration predictions, whereas MOMENT and TimeGPT perform best during moderate durations where temperature changes are less variable. This nuanced performance indicates the importance of considering duration-specific characteristics when evaluating model efficacy.\nIn summary, models that have been trained using the UCI dataset, such as Chronos, TimesFM, and MOMENT, demonstrated superior forecasting abilities on the same dataset. Shifting to the unseen electricity dataset, the performance gap between statistical models and TSFMs is marginal, indicating limited generalizability across datasets. For indoor air temperature forecasting, TSFMs generally outperform statistical models across extended prediction horizons with the lowest errors ranging from 1 to 1.4\u00b0F for durations up to 24"], "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/1": ["Our results indicate that TSFMs exhibit marginally better performance compared to statistical models on unseen sensing modality and/or patterns."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-16314501": 1, "wikipedia-35201597": 1, "wikipedia-35201519": 1, "wikipedia-1005416": 1, "wikipedia-18408210": 1, "wikipedia-596646": 1, "wikipedia-33223932": 1, "wikipedia-17835768": 1, "wikipedia-40674659": 1, "wikipedia-1935504": 1, "arxiv-2203.13067": 1, "arxiv-2312.07036": 1, "arxiv-1801.01466": 1, "arxiv-2211.13309": 1, "arxiv-2412.19412": 1, "arxiv-2307.10405": 1, "arxiv-2111.05564": 1, "arxiv-2501.08415": 1, "arxiv-2409.11733": 1, "arxiv-1510.01770": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/7": 3, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/16": 3, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/5": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/11": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/14": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/1": 2}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-16314501": 1, "wikipedia-35201597": 1, "wikipedia-35201519": 1, "wikipedia-1005416": 1, "wikipedia-18408210": 1, "wikipedia-596646": 1, "wikipedia-33223932": 1, "wikipedia-17835768": 1, "wikipedia-40674659": 1, "wikipedia-1935504": 1, "arxiv-2203.13067": 1, "arxiv-2312.07036": 1, "arxiv-1801.01466": 1, "arxiv-2211.13309": 1, "arxiv-2412.19412": 1, "arxiv-2307.10405": 1, "arxiv-2111.05564": 1, "arxiv-2501.08415": 1, "arxiv-2409.11733": 1, "arxiv-1510.01770": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/7": 3, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/16": 3, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/5": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/11": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/14": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/18": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/1": 3}}}

Other more common forms of tactition are smartphone and game controller vibrations.\nSection::::Human\u2013computer modalities.\nComputers can be equipped with various types of input devices and sensors to allow them to receive information from humans. Common input devices are often interchangeable if they have a standardized method of communication with the computer and afford practical adjustments to the user. Certain modalities can provide a richer interaction depending on the context, and having options for implementation allows for more robust systems.\nBULLET::::- Simple modalities\nBULLET::::- Keyboard\nBULLET::::- Pointing device\nBULLET::::- Touchscreen\nBULLET::::- Complex modalities\nBULLET::::- Computer vision\nBULLET::::- Speech recognition\nBULLET::::- Motion\nBULLET::::- Orientation\nWith the increasing popularity of smartphones, the general public are becoming more comfortable with the more complex modalities. Speech recognition was a major selling point of the iPhone 4S and following Apple products, with the introduction of Siri. This technology gives users an alternative way to communicate with computers when typing is less desirable. However, in a loud environment, the audition modality is not quite effective. This exemplifies how certain modalities have varying strengths depending on the situation. Other complex modalities such as computer vision in the form of Microsoft's Kinect or other similar technologies can make sophisticated tasks easier to communicate to a computer especially in the form of three dimensional movement."], "wikipedia-569650": ["Stimulus modality, also called sensory modality, is one aspect of a stimulus or what is perceived after a stimulus. For example, the temperature modality is registered after heat or cold stimulate a receptor. Some sensory modalities include: light, sound, temperature, taste, pressure, and smell. The type and location of the sensory receptor activated by the stimulus plays the primary role in coding the sensation. All sensory modalities work together to heighten stimuli sensation when necessary."], "wikipedia-2069491": ["In semiotics, a modality is a particular way in which information is to be encoded for presentation to humans, i.e. to the type of sign and to the status of reality ascribed to or claimed by a sign, text, or genre. Thus, the sensory modalities will be visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, gustatory, kinesthetic, etc. A list of sign types would include: writing, symbol, index, image, map, graph, diagram, etc. Some combinations of signs can be multi-modal, i.e. different types of signs grouped together for effect. But the distinction between a \"medium\" and a modality should be clarified: \nBULLET::::- \"text\" is a medium for presenting the modality of natural language;\nBULLET::::- \"image\" is both a medium and a modality;\nBULLET::::- \"music\" is a modality for the auditory media.\nSo, the \"modality\" refers to a certain type of information and/or the representation format in which information is stored. The \"medium\" is the means whereby this information is delivered to the senses of the interpreter."], "wikipedia-46975535": ["The information in real world usually comes as different modalities. For example, images are usually associated with tags and text explanations; texts contain images to more clearly express the main idea of the article. Different modalities are characterized by very different statistical properties. For instance, images are usually represented as pixel intensities or outputs of feature extractors, while texts are represented as discrete word count vectors. Due to the distinct statistical properties of different information resources, it is very important to discover the relationship between different modalities. Multimodal learning is a good model to represent the joint representations of different modalities. The multimodal learning model is also capable to fill missing modality given the observed ones. The multimodal learning model combines two deep Boltzmann machines each corresponds to one modality. An additional hidden layer is placed on top of the two Boltzmann Machines to give the joint representation.\nSection::::Motivation.\nA lot of models/algorithms have been implemented to retrieve and classify a certain type of data, e.g. image or text (where humans who interact with machines can extract images in a form of pictures and text that could be any message etc). However, data usually comes with different modalities (it is the degree to which a system's components may be separated or combined) which carry different information. For example, it is very common to caption an image to convey the information not presented by this image. Similarly, sometimes it is more straightforward to use an image to describe the information which may not be obvious from texts. As a result, if some different words appear in similar images, these words are very likely used to describe the same thing. Conversely, if some words are used in different images, these images may represent the same object. Thus, it is important to invite a novel model which is able to jointly represent the information such that the model can capture the correlation structure between different modalities. Moreover, it should also be able to recover missing modalities given observed ones, e.g. predicting possible image object according to text description. The Multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machine model satisfies the above purposes."], "wikipedia-1619306": ["There are four attributes of stimulus: modality, intensity, location, and duration. The neocortex in the mammalian brain has parcellations that primarily process sensory input from one modality. For example, primary visual area, V1, or primary somatosensory area, S1. These areas mostly deal with low-level stimulus features such as brightness, orientation, intensity, etc. These areas have extensive connections to each other as well as to higher association areas that further process the stimuli and are believed to integrate sensory input from various modalities. However, recently multisensory effects have been shown to occur in primary sensory areas as well."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

Nonetheless, AutoARIMA remains competitive, nearly matching the best-performing forecasting models.

Regarding statistical models, overall, AutoARIMA performs consistently close to the best TSFM TimesFM, BestFit outperforms three foundation models, and S-ARIMA outperforms two foundation models.

As the duration increases, temperature variations tend to smooth out, where TSFMs seem to perform better. Nonetheless, AutoARIMA remains competitive, nearly matching the best-performing forecasting models.

Table 3 illustrates the performance of each model, measured by RMSE. Our results provide insights into model performance across a diverse range of seasons and household characteristics.\n\nOur first dataset, UCI as shown in Table 3 (a), was used to train several TSFMs. Comparing model performance on familiar versus unfamiliar data reveals their generalization ability. Three models trained on this dataset (Chronos, TimesFM, MOMENT) perform best, especially for shorter durations. An interesting observation arises with the Uni2TS model, which approaches the performance of the others as the duration increases though it has not seen this data before. This phenomenon may occur because the data is resampled as the duration increases, resulting in a dataset that differs slightly from the original training data sampled every 15 minutes. Consequently, Uni2TS manages to close the performance gap. Comparing statistical models with foundation models, we observed that BestFit outperforms models that have not been trained on the UCI dataset (TimeGPT and Uni2TS) on \ud835\udc36 = 48 and 72.

The number of steps is not strictly different for varying durations, as data is resampled for longer periods, so performance discrepancies reflect behavioral characteristics. Evaluated on the Smart* dataset, Chronos loses its leading position to TimesFM. MOMENT and TimeGPT are comparable in terms of absolute performance, following TimesFM and AutoARIMA. Other FMs perform worse, and Uni2TS shows large errors due to outliers. Regarding statistical models, overall, AutoARIMA performs consistently close to the best TSFM TimesFM, BestFit outperforms three foundation models, and S-ARIMA outperforms two foundation models. Compared to the observations in the UCI dataset, the considerably larger errors of TSFMs suggest the challenging predictability of Smart* and the limited generalizability of TSFMs, narrowing the performance gap with statistical models.\n\nThe ecobee dataset presents a more diverse set of results (Ta-ble 3(c)), with statistical models outperforming others for shorter durations. As the duration increases, temperature variations tend to smooth out, where TSFMs seem to perform better. Nonetheless, AutoARIMA remains competitive, nearly matching the best-performing forecasting models. When comparing MOMENT, TimeGPT, and TimesFM, we find that TimesFM excels in long-duration predictions, whereas MOMENT and TimeGPT perform best during moderate durations where temperature changes are less variable.

It is commonly used to measure the success of an online advertising campaign for a particular website as well as the effectiveness of email campaigns.\nSection::::Online metrics.:Session success rate.\nSession success rate measures the ratio of user sessions that lead to a success. Defining \"success\" is often dependent on context, but for search a successful result is often measured using dwell time as a primary factor along with secondary user interaction, for instance, the user copying the result URL is considered a successful result, as is copy/pasting from the snippet.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Precision.\nPrecision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are relevant to the user's information need.\nIn binary classification, precision is analogous to positive predictive value. Precision takes all retrieved documents into account. It can also be evaluated at a given cut-off rank, considering only the topmost results returned by the system. This measure is called \"precision at n\" or \"P@n\".\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Recall.\nRecall is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved.\nIn binary classification, recall is often called sensitivity. So it can be looked at as \"the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query\".\nSection::::Offline metrics.:F-score / F-measure.\nThe weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, the traditional F-measure or balanced F-score is:\nThis is also known as the formula_11 measure, because recall and precision are evenly weighted.\nThe general formula for non-negative real formula_12 is:\nTwo other commonly used F measures are the formula_14 measure, which weights recall twice as much as precision, and the formula_15 measure, which weights precision twice as much as recall.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Average precision.\nPrecision and recall are single-value metrics based on the whole list of documents returned by the system. For systems that return a ranked sequence of documents, it is desirable to also consider the order in which the returned documents are presented. By computing a precision and recall at every position in the ranked sequence of documents, one can plot a precision-recall curve, plotting precision formula_21 as a function of recall formula_22. Average precision computes the average value of formula_21 over the interval from formula_24 to formula_25:\nThat is the area under the precision-recall curve.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Precision at K.\nFor modern (web-scale) information retrieval, recall is no longer a meaningful metric, as many queries have thousands of relevant documents, and few users will be interested in reading all of them. Precision at k documents (P@k) is still a useful metric (e.g., P@10 or \"Precision at 10\" corresponds to the number of relevant results on the first search results page), but fails to take into account the positions of the relevant documents among the top k. Another shortcoming is that on a query with fewer relevant results than k, even a perfect system will have a score less than 1. It is easier to score manually since only the top k results need to be examined to determine if they are relevant or not.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:R-Precision.\nR-precision requires knowing all documents that are relevant to a query. The number of relevant documents, formula_44, is used as the cutoff for calculation, and this varies from query to query. For example, if there are 15 documents relevant to \"red\" in a corpus (R=15), R-precision for \"red\" looks at the top 15 documents returned, counts the number that are relevant formula_22 turns that into a relevancy fraction: formula_46.\nPrecision is equal to recall at the R-th position.\nEmpirically, this measure is often highly correlated to mean average precision.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Mean average precision.\nMean average precision for a set of queries is the mean of the average precision scores for each query.\nwhere \"Q\" is the number of queries.\nSection::::Offline metrics.:Discounted cumulative gain.\nDCG uses a graded relevance scale of documents from the result set to evaluate the usefulness, or gain, of a document based on its position in the result list. The premise of DCG is that highly relevant documents appearing lower in a search result list should be penalized as the graded relevance value is reduced logarithmically proportional to the position of the result.\nThe DCG accumulated at a particular rank position formula_48 is defined as:"], "wikipedia-9578059": ["Numerous metrics have been formulated over time and their suitability discussed at great length. A general problem observed is that the more accurate and universally applicable the metric devised, the more complex and unemployable it becomes. A good metric must be clearly defined, simple, measurable, objective rather than subjective and must ultimately drive the desired behavior.\n\nSection::::Effective Mass Yield.\nEffective mass yield is defined as the percentage of the mass of the desired product relative to the mass of all non-benign materials used in its synthesis. Hudlicky \"et al.\" suggests the following equation:\nEffective mass yield (%) = mass of products \u00d7 100% / mass of non-benign reagents\n\nSection::::Carbon efficiency.\nCarbon efficiency is how much carbon ends up in the useful product compared to how much carbon was used to create the product.\nCarbon efficiency (%) = amount of carbon in product \u00d7 100% / total carbon present in reactants\n\nSection::::Atom economy.\nAtom economy is different from other green chemistry metrics, most of these were designed to measure process improvements. Barry Trost conversely, designed atom economy as a framework by which organic chemists would pursue \u201cgreener\u201d chemistry. The atom economy number is how much of the reactants remain in the final product. This is shown below:\nFor a generic multi-stage reaction:\nBULLET::::1. A + B \u2192 C\nBULLET::::2. C + D \u2192 E\nBULLET::::3. E + F \u2192 G\nAtom economy = m.w. of G \u00d7 100% /\n\u03a3 (m.w. A,B,D,F)\n\nSection::::Reaction mass efficiency.\nThe reaction mass efficiency takes into account atom economy, chemical yield and stoichiometry. For a generic reaction A + B \u2192 C, the formula can take either of the two forms shown below:\n(1) Reaction mass efficiency = molecular weight of product C \u00d7 yield / \nm.w. A + (m.w. B \u00d7 molar ratio B/A)\n(2) Reaction mass efficiency = mass of product C \u00d7 100% / mass of A + mass of B\n\nSection::::Environmental (E) factor.\nThe first general metric for green chemistry remains one of the most flexible and popular ones. Roger A. Sheldon\u2019s E-factor can be made as complex and thorough or as simple as desired and useful.\nThe E-factor the ratio of the mass of waste per mass of product:\n\nSection::::The EcoScale.\nThe EcoScale metric was proposed in an article in the Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry in 2006 for evaluation of the effectiveness of a synthetic reaction. It is characterized by simplicity and general applicability. Like the yield-based scale, the EcoScale gives a score from 0 to 100, but also takes into account cost, safety, technical set-up, energy and purification aspects."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The motto of The Royal Society is 'Nullius in verba', translated \"Take no man's word for it.\" Many funding agencies, institutions, and publication venues have policies regarding data sharing because transparency and openness are considered by many to be part of the scientific method.\nA number of funding agencies and science journals require authors of peer-reviewed papers to share any supplemental information (raw data, statistical methods or source code) necessary to understand, develop or reproduce published research. A great deal of scientific research is not subject to data sharing requirements, and many of these policies have liberal exceptions. In the absence of any binding requirement, data sharing is at the discretion of the scientists themselves. In addition, in certain situations governments and institutions prohibit or severely limit data sharing to protect proprietary interests, national security, and subject/patient/victim confidentiality. Data sharing may also be restricted to protect institutions and scientists from use of data for political purposes.\nData and methods may be requested from an author years after publication. In order to encourage data sharing and prevent the loss or corruption of data, a number of funding agencies and journals established policies on data archiving. Access to publicly archived data is a recent development in the history of science made possible by technological advances in communications and information technology. To take full advantage of modern rapid communication may require consensual agreement on the criteria underlying mutual recognition of respective contributions. Models recognized for improving the timely sharing of data for more effective response to emergent infectious disease threats include the data sharing mechanism introduced by the GISAID Initiative.\nDespite policies on data sharing and archiving, data withholding still happens. Authors may fail to archive data or they only archive a portion of the data. Failure to archive data alone is not data withholding. When a researcher requests additional information, an author sometimes refuses to provide it. When authors withhold data like this, they run the risk of losing the trust of the science community.\nData sharing may also indicate the sharing of personal information on a social media platform."], "wikipedia-2041431": ["File sharing is the practice of distributing or providing access to digitally stored information, such as computer programs, multi-media (audio, video), documents, or electronic books. It may be implemented through a variety of ways. Storage, transmission, and distribution models are common methods of file sharing incorporate manual sharing using removable media, centralized computer file server installations on computer networks, World Wide Web-based hyperlinked documents, and the use of distributed peer-to-peer networking (see peer-to-peer file sharing).\n\nIn computer science, the issue of handling shared resources figures prominently. For example, time-sharing is an approach to interactive computing in which a single computer is used to provide apparently simultaneous interactive general-purpose computing to multiple users by sharing processor time. Sharing of resources between processes and threads is the source of most of the difficulties of concurrent programming. The word \"sharing\" is also used in some functional programming communities to refer specifically to sharing of memory between different data items to save space, otherwise known as hash consing.\n\nResource sharing - called kal\u00e1ka in Hungarian - is an old tradition in Hungary. Young couples had to build their house after marriage. Marriage itself was called h\u00e1zasod\u00e1s in Hungarian (en: becoming the owner of a house). When doing so the whole community, relatives and acquaintances helped the young couple with work, knowledge and even money. At pigsticking, all members of the community got their shares too. Superfluous plants were freely distributed for neighbours in the season.\n\nMarket sharing occurs when competitors agree to divide or allocate customers, suppliers or territories among themselves rather than allowing competitive market forces to work.\n\nMarket sharing can include:\nBULLET::::- allocating customers by geographic area\nBULLET::::- dividing contracts by value within an area\nAlso agreeing not to:\nBULLET::::- compete for established customers\nBULLET::::- produce each other\u2019s products or services\nBULLET::::- expand into a competitor\u2019s market"]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. **Yes**  \n2.

To test the general ability of TSFMs in predicting indoor temperature, we utilized a large publicly available dataset from ecobee [13].

A starting point was sampled from each month, using the same starting points across models for a deterministic comparison, while resampling starting points for each house to ensure greater time diversity. This approach allows us to capture diverse house behaviors, climates, and seasonal variations. Sampling starting points was mainly necessary because the data duration changes based on varying context windows and prediction horizon values.\n3.1.2 UCI Electricity Data. Similarly, to evaluate the general capability of these models in energy consumption predictions, we used the UCI Electricity Load Diagrams dataset [20]. This dataset, frequently used to evaluate forecasting algorithsm, provides an opportunity to reconsider the performance rankings of TSFMs using different metrics. The dataset records electricity consumption in Watts for 370 Portuguese clients from 2011 to 2014, sampled at 15-minute intervals. We sampled 30 houses in this dataset, and for each season, we sampled a starting point, resulting in 16 starting points for the each client. This method ensures a comprehensive evaluation across different seasonal contexts and house specifics.\n3.1.3 Smart*. The dataset contains whole-house electricity consumption for 114 single-family apartments for the period of 2014-2016 in kW [2], sampled every 15 minutes. Similar to the previous approach, we sampled 30 houses in this dataset and, for each season, sampled 4 different starting points.\nWe analyzed the list of training datasets presented by each TSFM.

However, how should we present model responses to users so they are most amenable to be corrected from user feedback? Further, what properties do users value to understand and trust responses? We answer these questions by analyzing the effect of rationales (or explanations) generated by QA models to support their answers. We specifically consider decomposed QA models that first extract an intermediate rationale based on a context and a question and then use solely this rationale to answer the question. A rationale outlines the approach followed by the model to answer the question. Our work considers various formats of these rationales that vary according to well-defined properties of interest. We sample rationales from language models using few-shot prompting for two datasets, and then perform two user studies. First, we present users with incorrect answers and corresponding rationales in various formats and ask them to provide natural language feedback to revise the rationale. We then measure the effectiveness of this feedback in patching these rationales through in-context learning. The second study evaluates how well different rationale formats enable users to understand and trust model answers, when they are correct. We find that rationale formats significantly affect how easy it is (1) for users to give feedback for rationales, and (2) for models to subsequently execute this feedback.

To complement existing feature extraction techniques, this paper introduces a novel framework that leverages large language models to model audience forward-looking beliefs about how stories might unfold. Our method generates multiple potential continuations for each story and extracts features related to expectations, uncertainty, and surprise using established content analysis techniques. Applying our method to over 30,000 book chapters, we demonstrate that our framework complements existing feature engineering techniques by amplifying their marginal explanatory power on average by 31%. The results reveal that different types of engagement-continuing to read, commenting, and voting-are driven by distinct combinations of current and anticipated content features.

Yet \"Industrial Big Data\" analytics is more interested in finding the physical root cause behind features extracted from the phenomena. This means effective \"Industrial Big Data\" analytics will require more domain know-how than general \"Big Data\" analytics.\n\nBroken: Compared to \"Big Data\" analytics, \"Industrial Big Data\" analytics favors the \"completeness\" of data over the \"volume\" of the data, which means that in order to construct an accurate data-driven analytical system, it is necessary to prepare data from different working conditions. Due to communication issues and multiple sources, data from the system might be discrete and un-synchronized. That is why pre-processing is an important procedure before actually analyzing the data to make sure that the data are complete, continuous and synchronized.\n\nBad-Quality: The focus of \"Big Data\" analytics is mining and discovering, which means that the volume of the data might compensate the low-quality of the data. However, for \"Industrial Big Data\", since variables usually possess clear physical meanings, data integrity is of vital importance to the development of the analytical system. Low-quality data or incorrect recordings will alter the relationship between different variables and will have a catastrophic impact on the estimation accuracy.\n\nTherefore, simply transferring the techniques developed for general-purpose big data analytics might not work well for industrial data. Industrial big data requires deeper domain knowledge, clear definitions of analytical system functions, and the right timing of delivering extracted insights to the right personnel to support wiser decision making."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

To test the general ability of TSFMs in predicting indoor temperature, we utilized a large publicly available dataset from ecobee [13]. This dataset is a subset of ecobee\u2019s Donate Your Data program, containing data from 1,000 homes located in four U.S. states\u2014California, Texas, Illinois, and New York\u2014collected in 2017 at 5-minute intervals with a temperature resolution of 1\u00b0F. To ensure statistically significant yet computationally feasible tests, we selected eight houses with the least number of missing thermostat temperature values from each state, resulting in 32 houses. A starting point was sampled from each month, using the same starting points across models for a deterministic comparison, while resampling starting points for each house to ensure greater time diversity. This approach allows us to capture diverse house behaviors, climates, and seasonal variations. Sampling starting points was mainly necessary because the data duration changes based on varying context windows and prediction horizon values.\n3.1.2 UCI Electricity Data. Similarly, to evaluate the general capability of these models in energy consumption predictions, we used the UCI Electricity Load Diagrams dataset [20]. This dataset, frequently used to evaluate forecasting algorithsm, provides an opportunity to reconsider the performance rankings of TSFMs using different metrics. The dataset records electricity consumption in Watts for 370 Portuguese clients from 2011 to 2014, sampled at 15-minute intervals. We sampled 30 houses in this dataset, and for each season, we sampled a starting point, resulting in 16 starting points for the each client. This method ensures a comprehensive evaluation across different seasonal contexts and house specifics.\n3.1.3 Smart*. The dataset contains whole-house electricity consumption for 114 single-family apartments for the period of 2014-2016 in kW [2], sampled every 15 minutes.

EMS offers more detailed energy information than utility billing can provide; another advantage is that outside factors affecting energy use, such as weather condition or building occupancy, can be accounted for as part of the reporting process. This information can be used to prioritize energy savings initiatives and balance energy savings against energy-related capital expenditures.\nBill verification can be used to compare metered consumption against billed consumption. Bill analysis can also demonstrate the impact of different energy costs, for example by comparing electrical demand charges to consumption costs.\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) accounting can calculate direct or indirect GHG emissions, which may be used for internal reporting or enterprise carbon accounting.\nSection::::Monitoring.\nMonitoring tools track and display real-time and historical data. Often, EMS includes various benchmarking tools, such as energy consumption per square foot, weather normalization or more advanced analysis using energy modelling algorithms to identify anomalous consumption. Seeing exactly when energy is used, combined with anomaly recognition, can allow Facility or Energy Managers to identify savings opportunities.\nInitiatives such as demand shaving, replacement of malfunctioning equipment, retrofits of inefficient equipment, and removal of unnecessary loads can be discovered and coordinated using the EMS. For example, an unexpected energy spike at a specific time each day may indicate an improperly set or malfunctioning timer. These tools can also be used for Energy Monitoring and Targeting. EMS uses models to correct for variable factors such as weather when performing historical comparisons to verify the effect of conservation and efficiency initiatives.\nEMS may offer alerts, via text or email messages, when consumption values exceed pre-defined thresholds based on consumption or cost. These thresholds may be set at absolute levels, or use an energy model to determine when consumption is abnormally high or low. More recently, smartphones and tablets are becoming mainstream platforms for EMS.\nSection::::Engagement.\nEngagement can refer to automated or manual responses to collected and analyzed energy data. Building control systems can respond as readily to energy fluctuation as a heating system can respond to temperature variation. Demand spikes can trigger equipment power-down processes, with or without human intervention.\nAnother objective of Engagement is to connect occupants\u2019 daily choices with building energy consumption. By displaying real-time consumption information, occupants see the immediate impact of their actions. The software can be used to promote energy conservation initiatives, offer advice to the occupants, or provide a forum for feedback on sustainability initiatives.\nPeople-driven energy conservation programs, such as those sponsored by Energy Education, can be highly effective in reducing energy use and cost. \nLetting occupants know their real-time consumption alone can be responsible for a 7% reduction in energy consumption."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Three models trained on this dataset (Chronos, TimesFM, MOMENT) perform best, especially for shorter durations. An interesting observation arises with the Uni2TS model, which approaches the performance of the others as the duration increases though it has not seen this data before. This phenomenon may occur because the data is resampled as the duration increases, resulting in a dataset that differs slightly from the original training data sampled every 15 minutes. Consequently, Uni2TS manages to close the performance gap. Comparing statistical models with foundation models, we observed that BestFit outperforms models that have not been trained on the UCI dataset (TimeGPT and Uni2TS) on \ud835\udc36 = 48 and 72. Besides, AutoARIMA and BestFit outperform LagLlama consistently despite LagLlama being trained on the dataset.\n\nSwitching to the Smart* electricity dataset (shown in Table 3 (b)) reveals a shift in model performance. The number of steps is not strictly different for varying durations, as data is resampled for longer periods, so performance discrepancies reflect behavioral characteristics. Evaluated on the Smart* dataset, Chronos loses its leading position to TimesFM. MOMENT and TimeGPT are comparable in terms of absolute performance, following TimesFM and AutoARIMA. Other FMs perform worse, and Uni2TS shows large errors due to outliers. Regarding statistical models, overall, AutoARIMA performs consistently close to the best TSFM TimesFM, BestFit outperforms three foundation models, and S-ARIMA outperforms two foundation models. Compared to the observations in the UCI dataset, the considerably larger errors of TSFMs suggest the challenging predictability of Smart* and the limited generalizability of TSFMs, narrowing the performance gap with statistical models.\n\nThe ecobee dataset presents a more diverse set of results (Ta-ble 3(c)), with statistical models outperforming others for shorter durations. As the duration increases, temperature variations tend to smooth out, where TSFMs seem to perform better. Nonetheless, AutoARIMA remains competitive, nearly matching the best-performing forecasting models. When comparing MOMENT, TimeGPT, and TimesFM, we find that TimesFM excels in long-duration predictions, whereas MOMENT and TimeGPT perform best during moderate durations where temperature changes are less variable. This nuanced performance indicates the importance of considering duration-specific characteristics when evaluating model efficacy.\n\nIn summary, models that have been trained using the UCI dataset, such as Chronos, TimesFM, and MOMENT, demonstrated superior forecasting abilities on the same dataset. Shifting to the unseen electricity dataset, the performance gap between statistical models and TSFMs is marginal, indicating limited generalizability across datasets. For indoor air temperature forecasting, TSFMs generally outperform statistical models across extended prediction horizons with the lowest errors ranging from 1 to 1.4\u00b0F for durations up to 24"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-59968610": 2, "wikipedia-1514392": 1, "wikipedia-25050663": 1, "wikipedia-10747879": 1, "wikipedia-60968880": 1, "wikipedia-53985910": 1, "wikipedia-226722": 1, "wikipedia-46975535": 1, "wikipedia-15450": 1, "wikipedia-375416": 1, "arxiv-2411.15821": 1, "arxiv-2409.04556": 1, "arxiv-2005.12062": 1, "arxiv-2307.12532": 1, "arxiv-2410.12723": 1, "arxiv-2210.09167": 1, "arxiv-2501.08506": 1, "arxiv-2501.12535": 1, "arxiv-1808.00525": 1, "arxiv-2410.21359": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/16": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/5": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/10": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/14": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/11": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/3": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-59968610": 3, "wikipedia-1514392": 1, "wikipedia-25050663": 1, "wikipedia-10747879": 1, "wikipedia-60968880": 1, "wikipedia-53985910": 1, "wikipedia-226722": 1, "wikipedia-46975535": 1, "wikipedia-15450": 1, "wikipedia-375416": 1, "arxiv-2411.15821": 2, "arxiv-2409.04556": 1, "arxiv-2005.12062": 1, "arxiv-2307.12532": 2, "arxiv-2410.12723": 1, "arxiv-2210.09167": 1, "arxiv-2501.08506": 1, "arxiv-2501.12535": 1, "arxiv-1808.00525": 1, "arxiv-2410.21359": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/16": 2, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/5": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/10": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/14": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/11": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/3": 1}}}

The DEPM database system contains numerous national, government-sponsored food intake surveys and chemical residue data from monitoring programs. In this model, consumption is expressed in terms 11 food groups containing 800 core foods which were selected to allow matching between food consumption and chemical residue data. These 800 core food items were established from mean values of consumption of over 6,700 foods commonly identified in food surveys. This model utilizes per capita food consumption rates for these 800 core foods for the population in the USA and also for roughly 24 subpopulations defined by different demographic factors such as gender, age, and ethnicity. A critical component of the DEPM model is the recipes which convert food as consumed to the raw agricultural commodities for which the chemical residue data is collected. The residue database contains average values of residues for more than 350 pesticides and environmental contaminants.\nThe model is run by selecting a food consumption database, a chemical residue database and a population. Based on these selections the model output is the average daily intake of a chemical for an individual with the average diet for the selected population. A diet can be specified based on selecting core foods then that diet can be matched with residue data and used to estimate exposure.\n\nSection::::Dietary Exposure Model Examples.:Dietary Exposure Evaluation Model (DEEM).\nDEEM is a computer based model developed by Novigen Sciences, Inc. that estimates dietary intake of chemical residues and provides output including dietary exposure estimates for different time ranges for populations or for individuals. This model converts food consumed to raw agricultural commodities using the USDA-EPA Food Commodity Intake Database recipes. DEEM utilizes Monte Carlo analysis to provide probabilistic assessments of dietary pesticide exposure. The EPA Office of Pesticide Programs uses DEEM for exposure and risk assessments.\nThe DEEM can be used for cumulative exposure analysis when multiple chemicals on multiple foods must be evaluated for a total exposure assessment. Also, DEEM software can be used with Calendex which is a cumulative aggregate exposure assessment software used to combine dietary and non-dietary or residential exposures."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

In the past, selective exposure had been studied from a motivational standpoint. For instance, the reason behind the existence of selective exposure was that people felt motivated to decrease the level of dissonance they felt while encountering inconsistent information. They also felt motivated to defend their decisions and positions, so they achieved this goal by exposing themselves to consistent information only. However, the new cognitive economy model not only takes into account the motivational aspects, but it also focuses on the cognitive processes of each individual. For instance, this model proposes that people cannot evaluate the quality of inconsistent information objectively and fairly because they tend to store more of the consistent information and use this as their reference point. Thus, inconsistent information is often observed with a more critical eye in comparison to consistent information. According to this model, the levels of selective exposure experienced during the decision-making process are also dependent on how much cognitive energy people are willing to invest. Just as people tend to be careful with their finances, cognitive energy or how much time they are willing to spend evaluating all the evidence for their decisions works the same way. People are hesitant to use this energy; they tend to be careful so they don't waste it. Thus, this model suggests that selective exposure does not happen in separate stages. Rather, it is a combined process of the individuals' certain acts of motivations and their management of the cognitive energy."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

When comparing MOMENT, TimeGPT, and TimesFM, we find that TimesFM excels in long-duration predictions, whereas MOMENT and TimeGPT perform best during moderate durations where temperature changes are less variable. This nuanced performance indicates the importance of considering duration-specific characteristics when evaluating model efficacy.\nIn summary, models that have been trained using the UCI dataset, such as Chronos, TimesFM, and MOMENT, demonstrated superior forecasting abilities on the same dataset. Shifting to the unseen electricity dataset, the performance gap between statistical models and TSFMs is marginal, indicating limited generalizability across datasets.

Models like UniTime [12] and TimeLLM [11] incorporate context but are not zero-shot predictors. In contrast, zero-shot TSFMs typically rely only on time-series data, lacking auxiliary context that could improve predictions. Unlike language models that leverage contextual cues such as syntax and semantics, time-series data often lacks this information, complicating pattern recognition. Additionally, the variability in time-series data, driven by factors like physical processes and sensor characteristics, adds complexity. To enhance robustness, TSFMs need to incorporate auxiliary information or undergo fine-tuning to account for this diversity."], "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/3": ["Building on the rapid advancement of large language models, time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have also experienced significant development as of late.

Three models trained on this dataset (Chronos, TimesFM, MOMENT) perform best, especially for shorter durations. An interesting observation arises with the Uni2TS model, which approaches the performance of the others as the duration increases though it has not seen this data before. This phenomenon may occur because the data is resampled as the duration increases, resulting in a dataset that differs slightly from the original training data sampled every 15 minutes. Consequently, Uni2TS manages to close the performance gap. Comparing statistical models with foundation models, we observed that BestFit outperforms models that have not been trained on the UCI dataset (TimeGPT and Uni2TS) on \ud835\udc36 = 48 and 72.

Our results provide insights into model performance across a diverse range of seasons and household characteristics.\nOur first dataset, UCI as shown in Table 3 (a), was used to train several TSFMs. Comparing model performance on familiar versus unfamiliar data reveals their generalization ability. Three models trained on this dataset (Chronos, TimesFM, MOMENT) perform best, especially for shorter durations. An interesting observation arises with the Uni2TS model, which approaches the performance of the others as the duration increases though it has not seen this data before. This phenomenon may occur because the data is resampled as the duration increases, resulting in a dataset that differs slightly from the original training data sampled every 15 minutes. Consequently, Uni2TS manages to close the performance gap. Comparing statistical models with foundation models, we observed that BestFit outperforms models that have not been trained on the UCI dataset (TimeGPT and Uni2TS) on \ud835\udc36 = 48 and 72. Besides, AutoARIMA and BestFit outperform LagLlama consistently despite LagLlama being trained on the dataset.\nSwitching to the Smart* electricity dataset (shown in Table 3 (b)) reveals a shift in model performance. The number of steps is not strictly different for varying durations, as data is resampled for longer periods, so performance discrepancies reflect behavioral characteristics.

The SEQUAL framework, which stands for \"semiotic quality framework\" is developed by John Krogstie and others since the 1990s.\nThe SEQUAL framework is a so-called \"top-down quality framework\", which is based on semiotic theory, such as the works of Charles W. Morris. Building on these theory it \"defines several quality aspects based on relationships between a model, a body of knowledge, a domain, a modeling language, and the activities of learning, taking action, and modeling\". Its usefulness, according to Mendling et al. (2006), was confirmed in a 2002 experiment by Moody et al.\nThe basic idea behind the SEQUAL framework is, that \"conceptual models can be considered as sets of statements in a language, and therefore can be evaluated in semiotic/linguistic terms\". A first semiotic framework for evaluating conceptual models was originally proposed by Lindland et al. in the 1994 article \"Understanding quality in conceptual modeling\". In its initial version, it considered three quality levels: \n- syntactic,\n- semantic, and\n- pragmatic quality\nThe framework was later extended, and called the SEQUAL framework by Krogstie et al. in the 1995 article \"Defining quality aspects for conceptual models\". in the 2002 article \"Quality of interactive models\" Krogstie & J\u00f8rgensen extended the initial framework adding\nmore levels of Stamper's semiotic ladder.\n\nThe Quality Framework works with a set of eight items:\n- A: Actors that develop or have to relate to (parts of) the model. Can be persons or tools.\n- L: What can be expressed in the modeling language\n- M: What is expressed in the model\n- D: What can be expressed about the domain (area of interest)\n- K: The explicit knowledge of the participating persons\n- I: What the persons in the audience interpret the model to say\n- T: What relevant tools interpret the model to say\n- G: The goals of the modeling\n\nThe three main aspects of physical quality are: \n- \"Externalization\" or the question \"Is it possible to externalize knowledge by using the model language?\",\n- \"Internalizability\" about model persistence and availability, and\n- \"Basically\" or the question \"Is the model language able to express the model domain?\"\n\nTo evaluate empirical quality, the model should be well externalized. Main aspects are: \n- Ergonomics,\n- readability,\n- layout, and\n- information theory.\n\nSyntactic quality is the correspondence between the model M and the language extension L of the language in which the model is written. Three aspects here are:\n- \"Error detection\": During a modeling session, some syntactical errors--- syntactic incompleteness --- should be allowed on a temporary basis. For instance, although the DFD language requires that all processes are linked to a flow, it is difficult to draw a process and a flow simultaneously. Syntactical completeness has to be checked upon user's request. So, in contrast to implicit checks where the tool is ``forcing\" the user to follow the language syntax, explicit check can only detect and report on existing errors. The user has to make the corrections.\n- \"Error correction\": to replace a detected error with a correct statement\n\nThe semantic goals of this framework are: \n- Validity; if all the statements in the model are correct and related to the problem. M\\D = \u00d8\n- Completeness; if the model contains all relevant and correct statements to solve this problem. D\\M = \u00d8\n\nPerceived semantic quality is the relation between an actor's interpretation of a model and his/her knowledge of the domain.\n- Perceived validity I\\K = \u00d8\n- Perceived completeness K\\I = \u00d8\n\nPragmatic quality is the correspondence between the model and people's interpretation of it. Comprehension is the only pragmatic goal in the framework. It is very important that people that read the model, understand it. No solution is good if no-one understands it. Pragmatic quality relates to the effect the model have on the participants and the world. Four aspects is treated specifically, that: \n- the human interpretation of the model is correct relative to what is meant.\n- the tool interpretation is correct relative to what is meant to be expressed in the model.\n- the participants learn based on the model.\n- the domain is changed (preferably in a positive direction relative to the goal of modeling).\n\nThe goal for the social quality is agreement. Agreement about knowledge, interpretation and model. Agreement is achieved if perceived semantic quality and comprehension are achieved. There is relative agreement and absolute agreement. For the three agreement parts (knowledge, interpretation and model) we can define:\n- Relative agreement in the three above agreement types; all Knowledge, Interpretation and Model are consistent.\n- Absolute agreement in the three above agreement types; all Knowledge, Interpretation and Model are equal.\n\nDegree of internalization of existing organizational reality."], "wikipedia-25988629": ["RDM uses \"robustness rather than optimality\" as a criterion to assess alternative policies. The traditional subjective utility framework ranks alternative decision options contingent on best estimate probability distributions. In general, there is a best (i.e., highest ranked) option. RDM analyses have employed several different definitions of robustness. These include: trading a small amount of optimum performance for less sensitivity to broken assumptions, good performance compared to the alternatives over a wide range of plausible scenarios, and keeping options open. All incorporate some type of satisficing criteria and, in contrast to expected utility approaches, all generally describe tradeoffs rather than provide a strict ranking of alternative options."], "wikipedia-1674621": ["Authors (Cardoso, Mendling, Neuman and Reijers, 2006) used complexity metrics to measure the simplicity and understandability of a design. This is supported by later research done by Mendling \"et al.\" who argued that without using the quality metrics to help question quality properties of a model, simple process can be modeled in a complex and unsuitable way. This in turn can lead to a lower understandability, higher maintenance cost and perhaps inefficient execution of the process in question.\nHommes quoted Wang \"et al.\" (1994) that all the main characteristic of quality of models can all be grouped under 2 groups namely correctness and usefulness of a model, correctness ranges from the model correspondence to the phenomenon that is modeled to its correspondence to syntactical rules of the modeling and also it is independent of the purpose to which the model is used.\nWhereas the usefulness can be seen as the model being helpful for the specific purpose at hand for which the model is constructed at first place. Hommes also makes a further distinction between internal correctness (empirical, syntactical and semantic quality) and external correctness (validity).\nFrom the research it was noticed that the quality framework was found to be both easy to use and useful in evaluating the quality of process models however it had limitations in regards to reliability and difficult to identify defects. These limitations led to refinement of the framework through subsequent research done by Krogstie. This framework is called SEQUEL framework by Krogstie \"et al.\" 1995 (Refined further by Krogstie & J\u00f8rgensen, 2002) which included three more quality aspects.\nBULLET::::- Physical quality: whether the externalized model is persistent and available for the audience to make sense of it.\nBULLET::::- Empirical quality: whether the model is modeled according to the established regulations regarding a given language.\nBULLET::::- Social quality: This regards the agreement between the stakeholders in the modeling domain.\nThe other framework in use is Guidelines of Modeling (GoM) based on general accounting principles include the six principles: Correctness, Clarity deals with the comprehensibility and explicitness (System description) of model systems.\nComprehensibility relates to graphical arrangement of the information objects and, therefore, supports the understand ability of a model.\nRelevance relates to the model and the situation being presented. Comparability involves the ability to compare models that is semantic comparison between two models, Economic efficiency; the produced cost of the design process need at least to be covered by the proposed use of cost cuttings and revenue increases.\nCorrectness, relevance and economic efficiency are prerequisites in the quality of models and must be fulfilled while the remaining guidelines are optional but necessary."], "wikipedia-17073876": ["In order to provide criticism of the CMM theory, it is important to establish a baseline for what accounts for a \"good\" study. Many scholars use different criteria for determining what makes a theory relevant, but they most often surround the following six concepts.\nBULLET::::1. Theories should be evaluated on their ability to produce hypotheses that are consistent with relevant evidence. CMM theory falls short under the criteria of rule 1 as it does not set out to provide measureable hypotheses that can be compared to any other situation. While CMM tries to outline the cause and effect relationship of communication, it fails to create consistencies as the theory dictates that each situation is different.\nBULLET::::2. General theories are preferred to less general theories. From the perspective of this rule, CMM theory is very general; however it is also very vague. The theory has difficulty focusing on exactly what is important in each interaction thereby not allowing those who study the theory to understand what is considered critical in a communicative interaction.\nBULLET::::3. Theories that produce several hypotheses are preferred to those that produce few. From this perspective, CMM theory fails as it neglects to have even a single hypothesis that is testable.\nBULLET::::4. It is more beneficial to evaluate research programs rather than individual theories. As CMM theory focuses on levels of contact between two (or more) persons engaged in communication, these findings from CMM research contribute beyond mere observation it is unsuccessful as a way to evaluate anything other than individual interactions.\nBULLET::::5. The overall implications of a theory mean that those with several are preferred over those with few. CMM theory focuses on how we create our social environments in the present, however it fails to predict how the theory can affect future events.\nBULLET::::6. Simplicity is considered a virtue. In accordance with this rule, CMM theory falls short. CMM is an extremely broad theory with many different terms, views and loopholes which makes a multifaceted study of communication even more complex."], "wikipedia-15015787": ["In statistics, an optimality criterion provides a measure of the fit of the data to a given hypothesis, to aid in model selection. A model is designated as the \"best\" of the candidate models if it gives the best value of an objective function measuring the degree of satisfaction of the criterion used to evaluate the alternative hypotheses. The term has been used to identify the different criteria that are used to evaluate a phylogenetic tree. For example, in order to determine the best topology between two phylogenetic trees using the maximum likelihood optimality criterion, one would calculate the maximum likelihood score of each tree and choose the one that had the better score. However, different optimality criteria can select different hypotheses. In such circumstances caution should be exercised when making strong conclusions. Many other disciplines use similar criteria or have specific measures geared toward the objectives of the field.

For domain-specific criteria, additional sources might be needed.", "wikipedia-2986559": ["The SEQUAL framework is systems modelling reference model for evaluating the quality of models. The SEQUAL framework, which stands for \"semiotic quality framework\" is developed by John Krogstie and others since the 1990s.\nThe SEQUAL framework is a so-called \"top-down quality framework\", which is based on semiotic theory, such as the works of Charles W. Morris. Building on these theory it \"defines several quality aspects based on relationships between a model, a body of knowledge, a domain, a modeling language, and the activities of learning, taking action, and modeling\". Its usefulness, according to Mendling et al. (2006), was confirmed in a 2002 experiment by Moody et al.\n\nThe basic idea behind the SEQUAL framework is, that \"conceptual models can be considered as sets of\nstatements in a language, and therefore can be evaluated in semiotic/linguistic terms\". A first semiotic\nframework for evaluating conceptual models was originally proposed by Lindland et al. in the 1994 article \"Understanding quality in conceptual modeling\". In its initial version, it considered three quality levels: \nBULLET::::- syntactic,\nBULLET::::- semantic, and\nBULLET::::- pragmatic quality\nThe framework was later extended, and called the SEQUAL framework by Krogstie et al. in the 1995 article \"Defining quality aspects for conceptual models\". in the 2002 article \"Quality of interactive models\" Krogstie & J\u00f8rgensen extended the initial framework adding\nmore levels of Stamper's semiotic ladder.\n\nSection::::SEQUAL framework topics.:Sets in the Quality Framework.\nThe Quality Framework works with a set of eight items:\nBULLET::::- A: Actors that develop or have to relate to (parts of) the model. Can be persons or tools.\nBULLET::::- L: What can be expressed in the modeling language\nBULLET::::- M: What is expressed in the model\nBULLET::::- D: What can be expressed about the domain (area of interest)\nBULLET::::- K: The explicit knowledge of the participating persons\nBULLET::::- I: What the persons in the audience interpret the model to say\nBULLET::::- T: What relevant tools interpret the model to say\nBULLET::::- G: The goals of the modeling\n\nSection::::SEQUAL framework topics.:Physical quality.\nThe three main aspects of physical quality are: \nBULLET::::- \"Externalization\" or the question \"Is it possible to externalize knowledge by using the model language?\",\nBULLET::::- \"Internalizability\" about model persistence and availability, and\nBULLET::::- \"Basically\" or the question \"Is the model language able to express the model domain?\"\n\"Externalization\" is presenting the modeller's concept in some model form for others to make sense of it. Other people can have look on it and can discuss. How other people perceives the model is a matter of internalization. After perceiving the model in their own way they can discuss and change their mind accordingly. To make sense others, it is better to have some model language in common. Physical quality refers to the possibility of externalizing models by using model language that should be available and of course in persistence manner to be internalized by audiences.\n\"How available is the model to audience?\" Availability depends on distributability, especially when members of the audience are geographically dispersed. Then, a model which is an electronically distributable format will be more easily distributed than one which must be printed on paper and sent by ordinary mail or fax. It may also matter exactly what is distributed, e.g. the model in an editable form or merely in an output format.\nHow persistent is the model, how protected is it against loss or damage? This also includes previous versions of the model, if these are relevant. E.g. for a model on disk, the physical quality will be higher if there is a backup copy, or even higher if this backup is on another disk whose failure is independent of the originals. Similarly, for models on paper, the amount and security of backup copies will be essential.\n\nSection::::SEQUAL framework topics.:Empirical quality.\nTo evaluate empirical quality, the model should be well externalized. Main aspects are: \nBULLET::::- Ergonomics,\nBULLET::::- readability,\nBULLET::::- layout, and\nBULLET::::- information theory.\nBasically empirical quality is about the question \"Is the model easily readable?\". Empirical quality deals with the variety of elements distinguished, error frequencies when being written or read, coding (shapes of boxes) and ergonomics for Computer-Human Interaction for documentation and modeling-tools. Ergonomics is the study of workplace design and the physical and psychological impact it has on workers. This quality is related to readability and layout. There are different factors that have an important impact on visual emphasis like size, solidity, foreground/background differences, colour (red attracts the eye more than other colours),change(blinking or moving symbols attract attention), position and so on.\nFor graph aesthetics there may be different consideration(Battista, 1994, Tamassia, 1988) like angles between edges not be too small, minimize the number of bends along edges, minimize the number of crossings between edges, place nodes with high degree in the centre of the drawing, have symmetry of sons in hierarchies, have uniform density of nodes in the drawing, have verticality of hierarchical structures and so on.\n\nSection::::SEQUAL framework topics.:Syntactical quality.\nSyntactic quality is the correspondence between the model M and the language extension L of the language in which the model is written. Three aspects here are:\nBULLET::::- \"Error detection\": During a modeling session, some syntactical errors--- syntactic incompleteness --- should be allowed on a temporary basis. For instance, although the DFD language requires that all processes are linked to a flow, it is difficult to draw a process and a flow simultaneously. Syntactical completeness has to be checked upon user's request. So, in contrast to implicit checks where the tool is ``forcing\" the user to follow the language syntax, explicit check can only detect and report on existing errors. The user has to make the corrections.\nBULLET::::- \"Error correction\": to replace a detected error with a correct statement\n\nSection::::SEQUAL framework topics.:Semantic quality.\nWhat is expressed in the model?\nThe semantic goals of this framework are: \nBULLET::::- Validity; if all the statements in the model are correct and related to the problem. M\\D = \u00d8\nBULLET::::- Completeness; if the model contains all relevant and correct statements to solve this problem. D\\M = \u00d8\n\nSection::::SEQUAL framework topics.:Perceived semantic quality.\nPerceived semantic quality is the relation between an actor's interpretation of a model and his/her knowledge of the domain.\nBULLET::::- Perceived validity I\\K = \u00d8\nBULLET::::- Perceived completeness K\\I = \u00d8\n\nSection::::SEQUAL framework topics.:Pragmatic quality.\nPragmatic quality is the correspondence between the model and people's interpretation of it. Comprehension is the only pragmatic goal in the framework. It is very important that people that read the model, understand it. No solution is good if no-one understands it. Pragmatic quality relates to the effect the model have on the participants and the world. Four aspects is treated specifically, that: \nBULLET::::- the human interpretation of the model is correct relative to what is meant.\nBULLET::::- the tool interpretation is correct relative to what is meant to be expressed in the model.\nBULLET::::- the participants learn based on the model.\nBULLET::::- the domain is changed (preferably in a positive direction relative to the goal of modeling).\n\nSection::::SEQUAL framework topics.:Social quality.\nThe goal for the social quality is agreement. Agreement about knowledge, interpretation and model. Agreement is achieved if perceived semantic quality and comprehension are achieved. There is relative agreement and absolute agreement. For the three agreement parts (knowledge, interpretation and model) we can define:\nBULLET::::- Relative agreement in the three above agreement types; all Knowledge, Interpretation and Model are consistent.\nBULLET::::- Absolute agreement in the three above agreement types; all Knowledge, Interpretation and Model are equal.\n\nSection::::SEQUAL framework topics.:Knowledge quality.\nDegree of internalization of existing organizational reality."], "wikipedia-639389": ["Section::::Methodology.:Five-E approach.\nOne model of policy analysis is the \"five-E approach\", which consists of examining a policy in terms of:\nBULLET::::- Effectiveness: How well does it work (or how well will it be predicted to work)?\nBULLET::::- Efficiency: How much work does or will it entail?

These include: trading a small amount of optimum performance for less sensitivity to broken assumptions, good performance compared to the alternatives over a wide range of plausible scenarios, and keeping options open.

Many scholars use different criteria for determining what makes a theory relevant, but they most often surround the following six concepts.\nBULLET::::1. Theories should be evaluated on their ability to produce hypotheses that are consistent with relevant evidence. CMM theory falls short under the criteria of rule 1 as it does not set out to provide measureable hypotheses that can be compared to any other situation. While CMM tries to outline the cause and effect relationship of communication, it fails to create consistencies as the theory dictates that each situation is different.\nBULLET::::2. General theories are preferred to less general theories. From the perspective of this rule, CMM theory is very general; however it is also very vague. The theory has difficulty focusing on exactly what is important in each interaction thereby not allowing those who study the theory to understand what is considered critical in a communicative interaction.\nBULLET::::3. Theories that produce several hypotheses are preferred to those that produce few. From this perspective, CMM theory fails as it neglects to have even a single hypothesis that is testable.\nBULLET::::4. It is more beneficial to evaluate research programs rather than individual theories. As CMM theory focuses on levels of contact between two (or more) persons engaged in communication, these findings from CMM research contribute beyond mere observation it is unsuccessful as a way to evaluate anything other than individual interactions.\nBULLET::::5. The overall implications of a theory mean that those with several are preferred over those with few. CMM theory focuses on how we create our social environments in the present, however it fails to predict how the theory can affect future events.\nBULLET::::6. Simplicity is considered a virtue.

For example, in order to determine the best topology between two phylogenetic trees using the maximum likelihood optimality criterion, one would calculate the maximum likelihood score of each tree and choose the one that had the better score. However, different optimality criteria can select different hypotheses. In such circumstances caution should be exercised when making strong conclusions.\nMany other disciplines use similar criteria or have specific measures geared toward the objectives of the field.

The position is a close relative of modularity of mind, but is considered more general in that it does not necessarily entail all the assumptions of Fodorian modularity (e.g., informational encapsulation). Instead, it is properly described as a variant of psychological nativism. Other cognitive scientists also hold the mind to be modular, without the modules necessarily possessing the characteristics of Fodorian modularity.\nDomain specificity emerged in the aftermath of the cognitive revolution as a theoretical alternative to empiricist theories that believed all learning can be driven by the operation of a few such general learning devices. Prominent examples of such domain-general views include Jean Piaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development, and the views of many modern connectionists. Proponents of domain specificity argue that domain-general learning mechanisms are unable to overcome the epistemological problems facing learners in many domains, especially language. In addition, domain-specific accounts draw support from the surprising competencies of infants, who are able to reason about things like numerosity, goal-directed behavior, and the physical properties of objects all in the first months of life. Domain-specific theorists argue that these competencies are too sophisticated to have been learned via a domain-general process like associative learning, especially over such a short time and in the face of the infant\u2019s perceptual, attentional, and motor deficits. \nCurrent proponents of domain specificity argue that evolution equipped humans (and indeed most other species) with specific adaptations designed to overcome persistent problems in the environment. For humans, popular candidates include reasoning about objects, other intentional agents, language, and number. Researchers in this field seek evidence for domain specificity in a variety of ways. Some look for unique cognitive signatures thought to characterize a domain (e.g. differences in ways infants reason about inanimate versus animate entities). Others try to show selective impairment or competence within but not across domains (e.g. the increased ease of solving the Wason Selection Task when the content is social in nature).

Domain knowledge usually must be learned from software users in the domain (as domain specialists/experts), rather than from software developers. It may include user workflows, data pipelines, business policies, configurations and constraints and is crucial in the development of a software application.

Table 3 illustrates the performance of each model, measured by RMSE. Our results provide insights into model performance across a diverse range of seasons and household characteristics.\nOur first dataset, UCI as shown in Table 3 (a), was used to train several TSFMs. Comparing model performance on familiar versus unfamiliar data reveals their generalization ability. Three models trained on this dataset (Chronos, TimesFM, MOMENT) perform best, especially for shorter durations. An interesting observation arises with the Uni2TS model, which approaches the performance of the others as the duration increases though it has not seen this data before. This phenomenon may occur because the data is resampled as the duration increases, resulting in a dataset that differs slightly from the original training data sampled every 15 minutes. Consequently, Uni2TS manages to close the performance gap. Comparing statistical models with foundation models, we observed that BestFit outperforms models that have not been trained on the UCI dataset (TimeGPT and Uni2TS) on \ud835\udc36 = 48 and 72. Besides, AutoARIMA and BestFit outperform LagLlama consistently despite LagLlama being trained on the dataset.\nSwitching to the Smart* electricity dataset (shown in Table 3 (b)) reveals a shift in model performance. The number of steps is not strictly different for varying durations, as data is resampled for longer periods, so performance discrepancies reflect behavioral characteristics. Evaluated on the Smart* dataset, Chronos loses its leading position to TimesFM. MOMENT and TimeGPT are comparable in terms of absolute performance, following TimesFM and AutoARIMA. Other FMs perform worse, and Uni2TS shows large errors due to outliers. Regarding statistical models, overall, AutoARIMA performs consistently close to the best TSFM TimesFM, BestFit outperforms three foundation models, and S-ARIMA outperforms two foundation models. Compared to the observations in the UCI dataset, the considerably larger errors of TSFMs suggest the challenging predictability of Smart* and the limited generalizability of TSFMs, narrowing the performance gap with statistical models.\nThe ecobee dataset presents a more diverse set of results (Ta-ble 3(c)), with statistical models outperforming others for shorter durations. As the duration increases, temperature variations tend to smooth out, where TSFMs seem to perform better. Nonetheless, AutoARIMA remains competitive, nearly matching the best-performing forecasting models. When comparing MOMENT, TimeGPT, and TimesFM, we find that TimesFM excels in long-duration predictions, whereas MOMENT and TimeGPT perform best during moderate durations where temperature changes are less variable. This nuanced performance indicates the importance of considering duration-specific characteristics when evaluating model efficacy.\nIn summary, models that have been trained using the UCI dataset, such as Chronos, TimesFM, and MOMENT, demonstrated superior forecasting abilities on the same dataset. Shifting to the unseen electricity dataset, the performance gap between statistical models and TSFMs is marginal, indicating limited generalizability across datasets. For indoor air temperature forecasting, TSFMs generally outperform statistical models across extended prediction horizons with the lowest errors ranging from 1 to 1.4\u00b0F for durations up to 24"]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-42365268": 1, "wikipedia-47647187": 1, "wikipedia-6606262": 1, "wikipedia-18038997": 1, "wikipedia-17322807": 1, "wikipedia-61005254": 1, "wikipedia-34215300": 1, "wikipedia-11103161": 1, "wikipedia-30441468": 1, "wikipedia-26565579": 1, "arxiv-2502.06037": 1, "arxiv-2410.12360": 1, "arxiv-2501.09045": 1, "arxiv-2412.19286": 1, "arxiv-2312.15042": 1, "arxiv-2006.11585": 1, "arxiv-2402.13470": 1, "arxiv-1411.1876": 1, "arxiv-2009.06864": 1, "arxiv-physics/0608285": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/19": 3, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/5": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/2": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/16": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-42365268": 1, "wikipedia-47647187": 1, "wikipedia-6606262": 1, "wikipedia-18038997": 1, "wikipedia-17322807": 1, "wikipedia-61005254": 1, "wikipedia-34215300": 1, "wikipedia-11103161": 1, "wikipedia-30441468": 1, "wikipedia-26565579": 1, "arxiv-2502.06037": 1, "arxiv-2410.12360": 1, "arxiv-2501.09045": 1, "arxiv-2412.19286": 1, "arxiv-2312.15042": 1, "arxiv-2006.11585": 1, "arxiv-2402.13470": 1, "arxiv-1411.1876": 1, "arxiv-2009.06864": 1, "arxiv-physics/0608285": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/19": 3, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/5": 2, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/2": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/0": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/3": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/17": 1, "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/16": 2}}}

While not all terms have exhaustive explanations, Wikipedia provides foundational definitions and relevance for these concepts.", "wikipedia-735430": ["A timestamp is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from rubber stamps used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received. Common examples of this type of timestamp are a postmark on a letter or the \"in\" and \"out\" times on a time card.\nIn modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data. For example, computer files contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and digital cameras add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.\nSection::::Digital timestamps.\nA timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.\nThis data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called timestamping. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping.\nTimestamps are typically used for logging events or in a sequence of events (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp.\nPractically all computer file systems store one or more timestamps in the per-file metadata.\nIn particular, most modern operating systems support the POSIX stat (system call), so each file has 3 timestamps associated with it:\ntime of last access (atime: ls -lu),\ntime of last modification (mtime: ls -l), and\ntime of last status change (ctime: ls -lc).\nSome file archivers and some version control software, when they copy a file from some remote computer to the local computer, adjust the timestamps of the local file to show the date/time in the past when that file was created or modified on that remote computer, rather than the date/time when that file was copied to the local computer."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Three models trained on this dataset (Chronos, TimesFM, MOMENT) perform best, especially for shorter durations. An interesting observation arises with the Uni2TS model, which approaches the performance of the others as the duration increases though it has not seen this data before. This phenomenon may occur because the data is resampled as the duration increases, resulting in a dataset that differs slightly from the original training data sampled every 15 minutes. Consequently, Uni2TS manages to close the performance gap. Comparing statistical models with foundation models, we observed that BestFit outperforms models that have not been trained on the UCI dataset (TimeGPT and Uni2TS) on \ud835\udc36 = 48 and 72. Besides, AutoARIMA and BestFit outperform LagLlama consistently despite LagLlama being trained on the dataset.\n\nThe ecobee dataset presents a more diverse set of results (Ta-ble 3(c)), with statistical models outperforming others for shorter durations. As the duration increases, temperature variations tend to smooth out, where TSFMs seem to perform better. Nonetheless, AutoARIMA remains competitive, nearly matching the best-performing forecasting models.

Three models trained on this dataset (Chronos, TimesFM, MOMENT) perform best, especially for shorter durations. An interesting observation arises with the Uni2TS model, which approaches the performance of the others as the duration increases though it has not seen this data before. This phenomenon may occur because the data is resampled as the duration increases, resulting in a dataset that differs slightly from the original training data sampled every 15 minutes. Consequently, Uni2TS manages to close the performance gap. Comparing statistical models with foundation models, we observed that BestFit outperforms models that have not been trained on the UCI dataset (TimeGPT and Uni2TS) on \ud835\udc36 = 48 and 72.

Table 3 illustrates the performance of each model, measured by RMSE. Our results provide insights into model performance across a diverse range of seasons and household characteristics.\nOur first dataset, UCI as shown in Table 3 (a), was used to train several TSFMs. Comparing model performance on familiar versus unfamiliar data reveals their generalization ability. Three models trained on this dataset (Chronos, TimesFM, MOMENT) perform best, especially for shorter durations. An interesting observation arises with the Uni2TS model, which approaches the performance of the others as the duration increases though it has not seen this data before. This phenomenon may occur because the data is resampled as the duration increases, resulting in a dataset that differs slightly from the original training data sampled every 15 minutes. Consequently, Uni2TS manages to close the performance gap. Comparing statistical models with foundation models, we observed that BestFit outperforms models that have not been trained on the UCI dataset (TimeGPT and Uni2TS) on \ud835\udc36 = 48 and 72. Besides, AutoARIMA and BestFit outperform LagLlama consistently despite LagLlama being trained on the dataset.\nSwitching to the Smart* electricity dataset (shown in Table 3 (b)) reveals a shift in model performance. The number of steps is not strictly different for varying durations, as data is resampled for longer periods, so performance discrepancies reflect behavioral characteristics. Evaluated on the Smart* dataset, Chronos loses its leading position to TimesFM. MOMENT and TimeGPT are comparable in terms of absolute performance, following TimesFM and AutoARIMA. Other FMs perform worse, and Uni2TS shows large errors due to outliers. Regarding statistical models, overall, AutoARIMA performs consistently close to the best TSFM TimesFM, BestFit outperforms three foundation models, and S-ARIMA outperforms two foundation models. Compared to the observations in the UCI dataset, the considerably larger errors of TSFMs suggest the challenging predictability of Smart* and the limited generalizability of TSFMs, narrowing the performance gap with statistical models.\nThe ecobee dataset presents a more diverse set of results (Ta-ble 3(c)), with statistical models outperforming others for shorter durations. As the duration increases, temperature variations tend to smooth out, where TSFMs seem to perform better. Nonetheless, AutoARIMA remains competitive, nearly matching the best-performing forecasting models. When comparing MOMENT, TimeGPT, and TimesFM, we find that TimesFM excels in long-duration predictions, whereas MOMENT and TimeGPT perform best during moderate durations where temperature changes are less variable. This nuanced performance indicates the importance of considering duration-specific characteristics when evaluating model efficacy.\nIn summary, models that have been trained using the UCI dataset, such as Chronos, TimesFM, and MOMENT, demonstrated superior forecasting abilities on the same dataset. Shifting to the unseen electricity dataset, the performance gap between statistical models and TSFMs is marginal, indicating limited generalizability across datasets.

The primary rationale behind this choice is that most models are optimized to make predictions within these limits [1, 4, 8]. During this selection, we considered the sampling rate and resampled to a lower temporal resolution when necessary.

Table 3 illustrates the performance of each model, measured by RMSE. Our results provide insights into model performance across a diverse range of seasons and household characteristics.\nOur first dataset, UCI as shown in Table 3 (a), was used to train several TSFMs. Comparing model performance on familiar versus unfamiliar data reveals their generalization ability. Three models trained on this dataset (Chronos, TimesFM, MOMENT) perform best, especially for shorter durations. An interesting observation arises with the Uni2TS model, which approaches the performance of the others as the duration increases though it has not seen this data before. This phenomenon may occur because the data is resampled as the duration increases, resulting in a dataset that differs slightly from the original training data sampled every 15 minutes. Consequently, Uni2TS manages to close the performance gap. Comparing statistical models with foundation models, we observed that BestFit outperforms models that have not been trained on the UCI dataset (TimeGPT and Uni2TS) on \ud835\udc36 = 48 and 72. Besides, AutoARIMA and BestFit outperform LagLlama consistently despite LagLlama being trained on the dataset.\nSwitching to the Smart* electricity dataset (shown in Table 3 (b)) reveals a shift in model performance. The number of steps is not strictly different for varying durations, as data is resampled for longer periods, so performance discrepancies reflect behavioral characteristics. Evaluated on the Smart* dataset, Chronos loses its leading position to TimesFM. MOMENT and TimeGPT are comparable in terms of absolute performance, following TimesFM and AutoARIMA. Other FMs perform worse, and Uni2TS shows large errors due to outliers. Regarding statistical models, overall, AutoARIMA performs consistently close to the best TSFM TimesFM, BestFit outperforms three foundation models, and S-ARIMA outperforms two foundation models. Compared to the observations in the UCI dataset, the considerably larger errors of TSFMs suggest the challenging predictability of Smart* and the limited generalizability of TSFMs, narrowing the performance gap with statistical models.\nThe ecobee dataset presents a more diverse set of results (Ta-ble 3(c)), with statistical models outperforming others for shorter durations. As the duration increases, temperature variations tend to smooth out, where TSFMs seem to perform better. Nonetheless, AutoARIMA remains competitive, nearly matching the best-performing forecasting models. When comparing MOMENT, TimeGPT, and TimesFM, we find that TimesFM excels in long-duration predictions, whereas MOMENT and TimeGPT perform best during moderate durations where temperature changes are less variable. This nuanced performance indicates the importance of considering duration-specific characteristics when evaluating model efficacy."], "paper/5/3671127.3698177.jsonl/14": ["In our analysis, we selected each context-prediction duration pair (\ud835\udc37,\ud835\udc43)based on two criteria:\ud835\udc36 < 512, and \ud835\udc3b < 64. The primary rationale behind this choice is that most models are optimized to make predictions within these limits [1, 4, 8]. During this selection, we considered the sampling rate and resampled to a lower temporal resolution when necessary. The context-prediction-sampling rate tuples (\ud835\udc37(h),\ud835\udc43(h),\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc60(mins))are as follows: ecobee: {(24,4,5),(36,4,5),(36,6,10),(48,6,10),(48,12,15),(96,12,15),(168,24,30)} Smart* and UCI: {(48,12,15),(72,12,15),(96,12,15),(48,24,15),(72,24,15),(96,24,30),(168,24,30)} For the Smart* and UCI datasets, we started with a larger number of horizons due to the original sampling rate of UCI being 15 minutes. We maintained this rate for the Smart* dataset to ensure a fair comparison between the two datasets. Additionally, considering the common weekly patterns in household behavior, we aimed to test the prediction performance of these models when a week of data is provided to predict the next day.

Climographs display data for two variables: (a) monthly average temperature and (b) monthly average precipitation.

The horizontal axis (x-axis) displays the 12 months while the vertical axis contains the precipitation scale on one side and the temperature scale on the other.\nWhile temperature is typically visualized using a line, some climographs opt to visualize the data using a bar. This method's advantage allows the climograph to display the average range in temperature (average minimum and average maximum temperatures) rather than a simple monthly average.\nSection::::Use.\nThe patterns in a climograph describe not just a location's climate but also provide evidence for that climate's relative location. For example, a climograph with a narrow range in temperature over the year might represent a location close to the equator, or alternatively a location adjacent to a large body of water exerting a moderating effect on the temperature range. Meanwhile, a wide range in annual temperature might suggest the opposite. We could also derive information about a site's ecological conditions through a climograph. For example, if precipitation is consistently low year-round, we might suggest the location reflects a desert; if there is a noticeable seasonal pattern to the precipitation, we might suggest the location experiences a monsoon season. When combining the temperature and precipitation patterns together, we have even better clues as to the local conditions.
