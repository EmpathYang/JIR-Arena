This book intends to make the theory accessible to a relatively general audience, requiring only some relevant scientific background.\n  The book starts with the assumption that suffering is mainly caused by frustration. Frustration means the failure of an agent (whether AI or human) to achieve a goal or a reward it wanted or expected. Frustration is inevitable because of the overwhelming complexity of the world, limited computational resources, and scarcity of good data. In particular, such limitations imply that an agent acting in the real world must cope with uncontrollability, unpredictability, and uncertainty, which all lead to frustration.\n  Fundamental in such modelling is the idea of learning, or adaptation to the environment. While AI uses machine learning, humans and animals adapt by a combination of evolutionary mechanisms and ordinary learning. Even frustration is fundamentally an error signal that the system uses for learning. This book explores various aspects and limitations of learning algorithms and their implications regarding suffering.\n  At the end of the book, the computational theory is used to derive various interventions or training methods that will reduce suffering in humans.

Early programming attempts have dealt almost exclusively with punning because this lends itself to simple straightforward rules. These primitive programs display no intelligence; instead they work off a template with a finite set of pre-defined punning options upon which to build.\nMore sophisticated computer joke programs have yet to be developed. Based on our understanding of the SSTH / GTVH humour theories, it is easy to see why. The linguistic scripts (a.k.a. frames) referenced in these theories include, for any given word, a \"large chunk of semantic information surrounding the word and evoked by it [...] a cognitive structure internalized by the native speaker\". These scripts extend much further than the lexical definition of a word; they contain the speaker's complete knowledge of the concept as it exists in his world. As insentient machines, computers lack the encyclopaedic scripts which humans gain through life experience. They also lack the ability to gather the experiences needed to build wide-ranging semantic scripts and understand language in a broader context, a context that any child picks up in daily interaction with his environment.\nFurther development in this field must wait until computational linguists have succeeded in programming a computer with an ontological semantic natural language processing system. It is only \"the most complex linguistic structures [which] can serve any formal and/or computational treatment of humor well\". Toy systems (i.e. dummy punning programs) are completely inadequate to the task. Despite the fact that the field of computational humour is small and underdeveloped, it is encouraging to note the many interdisciplinary efforts which are currently underway.

While the query is complex, Wikipedia offers foundational explanations that could partially address it.", "wikipedia-4643899": ["Emotions are an important characteristic of the human species. An emotion is an abstract concept that is most easily observed by looking at facial expressions. Emotions and their relation to categorical perception are often studied using facial expressions. Faces contain a large amount of valuable information.\nEmotions are divided into categories because they are discrete from one another. Each emotion entails a separate and distinct set of reactions, consequences, and expressions. The feeling and expression of emotions is a natural occurrence, and, it is actually a universal occurrence for some emotions. There are six basic emotions that are considered universal to the human species across age, gender, race, country, and culture and that are considered to be categorically distinct. These six basic emotions are: happiness, disgust, sadness, surprise, anger, and fear. According to the discrete emotions approach, people experience one emotion and not others, rather than a blend. Categorical perception of emotional facial expressions does not require lexical categories. Of these six emotions, happiness is the most easily identified.\nThe perception of emotions using facial expressions reveals slight gender differences based on the definition and boundaries (essentially, the \u201cedge line\u201d where one emotion ends and a subsequent emotion begins) of the categories. The emotion of anger is perceived easier and quicker when it is displayed by males. However, the same effects are seen in the emotion of happiness when portrayed by women. These effects are essentially observed because the categories of the two emotions (anger and happiness) are more closely associated with other features of these specific genders.\nAlthough a verbal label is provided to emotions, it is not required to categorically perceive them. Before language in infants, they can distinguish emotional responses. The categorical perception of emotions is by a \"hardwired mechanism\". Additional evidence exists showing the verbal labels from cultures that may not have a label for a specific emotion but can still categorically perceive it as its own emotion, discrete and isolated from other emotions. The perception of emotions into categories has also been studied using the tracking of eye movements which showed an implicit response with no verbal requirement because the eye movement response required only the movement and no subsequent verbal response.\nThe categorical perception of emotions is sometimes a result of joint processing. Other factors may be involved in this perception. Emotional expression and invariable features (features that remain relatively consistent) often work together. Race is one of the invariable features that contribute to categorical perception in conjunction with expression. Race can also be considered a social category. Emotional categorical perception can also be seen as a mix of categorical and dimensional perception. Dimensional perception involves visual imagery. Categorical perception occurs even when processing is dimensional."], "wikipedia-14659441": ["The covariation principle states that, \"an effect is attributed to the one of its possible causes with which, over time, it covaries\" (Kelley, 1973:108). That is, a certain behaviour is attributed to potential causes that appear at the same time. This principle is useful when the individual has the opportunity to observe the behaviour over several occasions. Causes of an outcome can be attributed to the person (internal), the stimulus (external), the circumstance, or some combination of these factors (Hewstone et al., 1973). Attributions are made based on three criteria: Consensus, Distinctiveness, and Consistency (Kelley, 1973).\n\nSection::::Consensus.\nConsensus is the co-variation of behavior across different people. If lots of people find Lisa attractive, consensus is high. If only Arnold finds Lisa attractive, consensus is low. High consensus is attributed to the stimulus (in the above example, to Lisa), while low consensus is attributed to the person (in this case, Arnold).\n\nSection::::Distinctiveness.\nDistinctiveness refers to how unique the behavior is to the particular situation. There is a low distinctiveness if an individual behaves similarly in all situations, and there exists a high distinctiveness when the person only shows the behaviour in particular situations. If the distinctiveness is high, one will attribute this behaviour more to the circumstance instead of person (Gilovich et al., 2005).\nReferring to the example of Dr. Stanton's complimenting Barry's work, if Dr. Stanton almost never compliments other people's work, he shows high distinctiveness. But if he compliments everybody's work, this is low distinctiveness, and one will attribute the behaviour to the person, in this case, Dr. Stanton (Orvis et al., 1975).\n\nSection::::Consistency.\nConsistency is the covariation of behavior across time. If Jane is generous all the time, she shows high consistency. If Jane is rarely generous or is generous only at specific times, perhaps around the holidays, she shows low consistency. High consistency is attributed to the person (Jane is a generous person), while low consistency is attributed to the circumstance (the holidays make people generous).\n\nSection::::Making attributions using consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency.\nAccording to Hewstone and Jaspars (1987), we are able to determine whether a person would likely make a personal (internal), stimulus (external) or circumstantial attribution by assessing the levels of consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency in a given situation: \nLow Consensus, Low Distinctiveness, High Consistency = Personal Attribution \nHigh Consensus, High Distinctiveness, High Consistency = Stimulus Attribution \nHigh Consensus, Low Distinctiveness, Low Consistency = Circumstance Attribution \nIn reference to McArthur's study (1972), consider the following example: \"John laughs at the comedian\" This outcome could be caused by something in the person (John), the stimulus (the comedian) the circumstances (the comedy club on that night), or some combination of these factors (Hewstone et al., 1987).\nIf John is the only person laughing at the comedian (low consensus), he laughs at the comedian at other comedy clubs (high consistency), and he laughs at other comedians (low distinctiveness), then the effect is seen as caused by something in the person (John).\nIf everyone is laughing at the comedian (high consensus), John laughs at the comedian at other comedy clubs (high consistency), and he does not laugh at other comedians (high distinctiveness), then the effect is seen as caused by something in the stimulus (the comedian).\nIf everyone is laughing at the comedian (high consensus), John doesn't laugh at the comedian at other comedy clubs (low consistency), and he laughs at other comedians at the club (low distinctiveness) then the effect is seen as caused by something in the circumstance (the comedy club on that night)."], "wikipedia-510995": ["The choices of different explanations for intentional behavior (reasons, belief reasons, etc.) indicate particular psychological functions. Reasons, for example, appear to reflect (among other things) psychological closeness. People increase reason explanations (relative to CHR explanations) when they explain their own rather than another person's behavior , when they portray another person in a positive light , and when they explain behaviors of nonhuman agents for whom they have ownership and affection (e.g., a pet fish; ). Conversely, people use fewer reasons and more CHR explanations when explaining behaviors of collectives or aggregate groups . Actor-observer asymmetries can therefore be seen as part of a broader continuum of psychological distance people have to various kinds of minds (their own, others', groups', animals' etc.)."], "wikipedia-511014": ["Attribution biases were first discussed in the 1950s and '60s by psychologists such as Fritz Heider, who studied attribution theory. Other psychologists, such as Harold Kelley and Ed Jones expanded Heider's early work by identifying conditions under which people are more or less likely to make different types of attributions.\n\nAttribution theory also provides explanations for why different people can interpret the same event in different ways and what factors contribute to attribution biases.\n\nHe noted that people tend to make distinctions between behaviors that are caused by personal disposition versus environmental or situational conditions. He also predicted that people are more likely to explain others' behavior in terms of dispositional factors (i.e., caused by a given person's personality), while ignoring the surrounding situational demands.\n\nKelley proposed that people are more likely to make dispositional attributions when consensus is low (most other people don't behave in the same way), consistency is high (a person behaves this way across most situations), and distinctiveness is low (a person's behavior is not unique to this situation). Alternatively, situational attributions are more likely reached when consensus is high, consistency is low, and distinctiveness is high.

Prior to the eighteenth century, it was a common belief that women and men represented two different forms of one essential sex: that is, women were seen to possess the same fundamental reproductive structure as men, the only difference being that female genitalia was inside the body, not outside of it. Anatomists saw the vagina as an interior penis, the labia as foreskin, the uterus as scrotum, and the ovaries as testicles. However, around the 18th century, the dominant view became that of two sexes directly opposite to each other. There was an abundance of literature written in the 18th century supporting the two-sex model. Jacques-Louis Moreau wrote that \"not only are the sexes different, but they are different in every conceivable aspect of body and soul, in every physical and moral aspect. To the physician or the naturalist, the relation of woman to man is a series of opposites and contrasts\". Women and men began to be seen as polar opposites and each sex was compared in relation to the other. Gender, prior to the eighteenth century, was not prescribed upon individual; a man could be physically male, but he could have a feminine gender identity. This was seen as being normal and acceptable. With the switch to the two-sex model, differences that had been expressed with reference to gender now came to be expressed with reference to sex and to biology."], "wikipedia-14662436": ["Part-based models refers to a broad class of detection algorithms used on images, in which various parts of the image are used separately in order to determine if and where an object of interest exists. Amongst these methods a very popular one is the constellation model which refers to those schemes which seek to detect a small number of features and their relative positions to then determine whether or not the object of interest is present.\nThese models build on the original idea of Fischler and Elschlager of using the relative position of a few template matches and evolve in complexity in the work of Perona and others. These models will be covered in the constellation models section. To get a better idea of what is meant by constellation model an example may be more illustrative. Say we are trying to detect faces. A constellation model would use smaller part detectors, for instance mouth, nose and eye detectors and make a judgment about whether an image has a face based on the relative positions in which the components fire.\nMany overlapping ideas are included under the title part-based models even after having excluded those models of the constellation variety. The uniting thread is the use of small parts to build up to an algorithm that can detect/recognize an item (face, car, etc.)\nLater efforts such as those by Poggio and Brunelli focus on building specific detectors for each feature. They use successive detectors to estimate scale, position, etc. and narrow the search field to be used by the next detector. As such it is a part-based model, however, they seek more to recognize specific faces rather than to detect the presence of a face. They do so by using each detector to build a 35 element vector of characteristics of a given face. These characteristic can then be compared to recognize specific faces, however cut-offs can also be used to detect whether a face is present at all.\nCootes, Lanitis and Taylor build on this work in constructing a 100 element representation of the primary features of a face. The model is more detailed and robust however, given the additional complexity (100 elements compared to 35) this might be expected. The model essentially computes deviations from a mean face in terms of shape, orientation and gray level. The model is matched by the minimization of an error function. These three classes of algorithms naturally fall within the scope of template matching\nOf the non-constellation perhaps the most successful is that of Leibe and Schiele. Their algorithm finds templates associated with positive examples and records both the template (an average of the feature in all positive examples where it is present) and the position of the center of the item (a face for instance) relative to the template. The algorithm then takes a test image and runs an interest point locater (hopefully one of the scale invariant variety). These interest points are then compared to each template and the probability of a match is computed. All templates then cast votes for the center of the detected object proportional to the probability of the match, and the probability the template predicts the center. These votes are all summed and if there are enough of them, well enough clustered, the presence of the object in question (i.e. a face or car) is predicted.\nThe algorithm is effective because it imposes much less constellational rigidity the way the constellation model does. Admittedly the constellation model can be modified to allow for occlusions and other large abnormalities but this model is naturally suited to it. Also it must be said that sometimes the more rigid structure of the constellation is desired."], "wikipedia-6470064": ["Together with Deanna Wilkes-Gibbs (1986), he also developed the collaborative model, a theory for explaining how people in conversation coordinate with one another to determine definite references.\n\nUnlike the literary model of definite reference, which takes into account only what the speaker does to create the definite reference; the conversational model has the speaker and the listener working together. The listener is interpreting at the same time as the speaker is talking, and the speaker may have to edit to rephrase what is being said based on how the listener reacts. Speaker A and speaker B must mutually accept the functionality and usefulness of A's reference before they can allow the conversation to go on. The belief that both have accepted the reference is established through a two-part process: (a)presentation and (b)acceptance. Speaker A presents a reference (e.g. the dog with the pink collar) and Speaker B accepts it by responding with the affirmation that he understood which dog was discussed. If A realizes the presentation wasn't definitive enough, he may edit his speech to be more specific (e.g. the dog with the pink collar, near the tree, by the parking lot over there).

The two models seem very different; in particular, model 1 is represented by a single discrete equation for the 1D wave function, while model 2 includes an additional equation for the transverse width. Nevertheless, numerical analyses show similar behaviors of fundamental unstaggered solitons in both systems, as concerns their existence region and stability limits. Both models admit the collapse of the localized modes, reproducing the fundamental property of the self-attractive BEC confined in tight traps. Thus, we conclude that the fundamental properties of discrete solitons predicted for the strongly trapped self-attracting BEC are reliable, as the two distinct models produce them in a nearly identical form. However, a difference between the models is found too, as strongly pinned (very narrow) discrete solitons, which were previously found in model 1, are not generated by model 2 -- in fact, in agreement with the continual 1D NPSE, which does not have such solutions either.

See Actor model and process calculi history.\nThere are many similarities between the two approaches, but also several differences (some philosophical, some technical):\nBULLET::::- There is only one Actor model (although it has numerous formal systems for design, analysis, verification, modeling, \"etc.\"); there are numerous process calculi, developed for reasoning about a variety of different kinds of concurrent systems at various levels of detail (including calculi that incorporate time, stochastic transitions, or constructs specific to application areas such as security analysis).\nBULLET::::- The Actor model was inspired by the laws of physics and depends on them for its fundamental axioms, \"i.e.\" physical laws (see Actor model theory); the process calculi were originally inspired by algebra .\nBULLET::::- Processes in the process calculi are anonymous, and communicate by sending messages either through named channels (synchronous or asynchronous), or via ambients (which can also be used to model channel-like communications ). In contrast, actors in the Actor model possess an identity, and communicate by sending messages to the mailing addresses of other actors (this style of communication can also be used to model channel-like communications \u2014 see below)."], "wikipedia-694147": ["Physical model (most commonly referred to simply as a model but in this context distinguished from a conceptual model) is a smaller or larger physical copy of an object. The object being modelled may be small (for example, an atom) or large (for example, the Solar System).\n\nThe geometry of the model and the object it represents are often similar in the sense that one is a rescaling of the other; in such cases the scale is an important characteristic. However, in many cases the similarity is only approximate or even intentionally distorted. Sometimes the distortion is systematic with e.g. a fixed scale horizontally and a larger fixed scale vertically when modelling topography of a large area (as opposed to a model of a smaller mountain region, which may well use the same scale horizontally and vertically, and show the true slopes).\n\nPhysical models allow visualization, from examining the model, of information about the thing the model represents. A model can be a physical object such as an architectural model of a building. Uses of an architectural model include visualization of internal relationships within the structure or external relationships of the structure to the environment. Other uses of models in this sense are as toys.\n\nInstrumented physical models are an effective way of investigating fluid flows for Engineering design. Physical models are often coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics models to optimize the design of equipment and processes. This includes external flow such as around buildings, vehicles, people, or hydraulic structures. Wind Tunnel and Water Tunnel testing is often used for these design efforts. Instrumented physical models can also examine internal flows, for the design of ductwork systems, pollution control equipment, food processing machines, and mixing vessels. Transparent flow models are used in this case to observe the detailed flow phenomenon. These models are scaled in terms of both geometry and important forces, for example using Froude number or Reynolds number scaling (see Similitude (model)).\n\nA physical model of something large is usually smaller, and of something very small is larger. A physical model of something that can move, like a vehicle or machine, may be completely static, or have parts that can be moved manually, or be powered. A physical model may show inner parts that are normally not visible. The purpose of a physical model on a smaller scale may be to have a better overview, for testing purposes, as hobby or toy. The purpose of a physical model on a larger scale may be to see the structure of things that are normally too small to see properly or to see at all, for example a model of an insect or of a molecule.\n\nA physical model of an animal shows the animals physical composition without it walking or flying away, and without danger, and if the real animal is not available.

He theorizes that a fundamental change in attitudes toward human sexual anatomy occurred in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. Prior to the eighteenth century, it was a common belief that women and men represented two different forms of one essential sex: that is, women were seen to possess the same fundamental reproductive structure as men, the only difference being that female genitalia was inside the body, not outside of it. Anatomists saw the vagina as an interior penis, the labia as foreskin, the uterus as scrotum, and the ovaries as testicles. However, around the 18th century, the dominant view became that of two sexes directly opposite to each other. There was an abundance of literature written in the 18th century supporting the two-sex model. Jacques-Louis Moreau wrote that \"not only are the sexes different, but they are different in every conceivable aspect of body and soul, in every physical and moral aspect. To the physician or the naturalist, the relation of woman to man is a series of opposites and contrasts\". Women and men began to be seen as polar opposites and each sex was compared in relation to the other."], "wikipedia-14662436": ["Part-based models refers to a broad class of detection algorithms used on images, in which various parts of the image are used separately in order to determine if and where an object of interest exists. Amongst these methods a very popular one is the constellation model which refers to those schemes which seek to detect a small number of features and their relative positions to then determine whether or not the object of interest is present.\nThese models build on the original idea of Fischler and Elschlager of using the relative position of a few template matches and evolve in complexity in the work of Perona and others. These models will be covered in the constellation models section. To get a better idea of what is meant by constellation model an example may be more illustrative. Say we are trying to detect faces. A constellation model would use smaller part detectors, for instance mouth, nose and eye detectors and make a judgment about whether an image has a face based on the relative positions in which the components fire.\nSection::::Non-constellation models.\n Many overlapping ideas are included under the title part-based models even after having excluded those models of the constellation variety. The uniting thread is the use of small parts to build up to an algorithm that can detect/recognize an item (face, car, etc.)\nLater efforts such as those by Poggio and Brunelli focus on building specific detectors for each feature. They use successive detectors to estimate scale, position, etc. and narrow the search field to be used by the next detector. As such it is a part-based model, however, they seek more to recognize specific faces rather than to detect the presence of a face. They do so by using each detector to build a 35 element vector of characteristics of a given face. These characteristic can then be compared to recognize specific faces, however cut-offs can also be used to detect whether a face is present at all.\nCootes, Lanitis and Taylor build on this work in constructing a 100 element representation of the primary features of a face. The model is more detailed and robust however, given the additional complexity (100 elements compared to 35) this might be expected. The model essentially computes deviations from a mean face in terms of shape, orientation and gray level. The model is matched by the minimization of an error function. These three classes of algorithms naturally fall within the scope of template matching\nOf the non-constellation perhaps the most successful is that of Leibe and Schiele. Their algorithm finds templates associated with positive examples and records both the template (an average of the feature in all positive examples where it is present) and the position of the center of the item (a face for instance) relative to the template. The algorithm then takes a test image and runs an interest point locater (hopefully one of the scale invariant variety). These interest points are then compared to each template and the probability of a match is computed. All templates then cast votes for the center of the detected object proportional to the probability of the match, and the probability the template predicts the center. These votes are all summed and if there are enough of them, well enough clustered, the presence of the object in question (i.e. a face or car) is predicted.\nThe algorithm is effective because it imposes much less constellational rigidity the way the constellation model does. Admittedly the constellation model can be modified to allow for occlusions and other large abnormalities but this model is naturally suited to it. Also it must be said that sometimes the more rigid structure of the constellation is desired."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

While there may be no general agreement on what an acceptable explanation should be like, many believe that a good explanation should have certain level of predictive accuracy. Descriptive models of social tagging typically are not concerned with explaining the actions of single individuals but describing the patterns that emerge as individual behavior is aggregated in a large social information system. Predictive models, however, attempt to explain aggregate patterns by analyzing how individuals interact and link to each other in ways that bring about similar or different emergent patterns of social behavior. In particular, a mechanism-based predictive model assumes a certain set of rule that individuals interact with each other, and understand how these interactions could produce aggregate patterns as observed and characterized by descriptive models.

This has led to some, like Monroe Beardsley, to say that only extrinsic values, in the final analysis, exist. Different kinds of extrinsic value in this model derive from the different underlying categories of relation, the example given being those of beauty, utility and meaning, each of which is supervenient on one of Kant's three categories of relation, namely disjunction, causality and inherence respectively. \nDeontology, on the other hand, (from the Greek \"Deon\" meaning \u201cduty\u201d) is the branch of ethics that bases value on moral principles which in turn form a guide to knowing what \"ought\" to be done in various situations. The problem in philosophy of moving from an \u201cis\u201d to an \u201cought\u201d (the \u201cIs-ought problem\") is said to have been introduced into philosophy by David Hume.

Given that \u201ca small number of core moral values are espoused universally\u201d the answer would appear to lie in giving priority to those which do not \u201cconflict\u201d.

Kant's categorical imperative is given as an example of the latter, although Frankena pointed out that a distinction would need to be made between arguments of logical necessity, i.e. those which contain no contradictions, and arguments of logical sufficiency which would be needed to account for the various kinds of value, whether \u201caesthetic, prudential or logical\u201d."], "wikipedia-33615960": ["Chemistry and physics are branches of science that both study matter.

In physics, it is typical to abstract from the specific type of matter, and to focus on the common properties of many different materials. In optics, for example, materials are characterized by their index of refraction, and materials with the same index of refraction will have identical properties. Chemistry, on the other hand, focuses on what compounds are present in a sample, and explores how changing the structure of molecules will change their reactivity and their physical properties.\nThe two sciences differ in the role that theory plays within the discipline. Physics can be divided into experimental and theoretical physics. Historically, theoretical physics has correctly predicted phenomena that were out of experimental reach at the time, and could be verified only after experimental techniques caught up. In chemistry, the role of theory historically has been a retrospective one, summarizing experimental data and predicting the outcome of similar experiments.

They have advanced memory skills, and are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing, and to understand human voice commands. Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception.\n\nIn the course of this research, behavioral scientists uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the domestic dog, abilities that are neither possessed by dogs' closest canine relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes. Rather, these skills resemble some of the social-cognitive skills of human children. This may be an example of Convergent evolution, which happens when distantly related species independently evolve similar solutions to the same problems.\n\nAs a result of this physical and social evolution, many dogs readily respond to social cues common to humans, quickly learn the meaning of words, show cognitive bias and exhibit emotions that seem to reflect those of humans.\n\nDogs show human-like social cognition in various ways. For example, dogs can react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing, and they also understand human voice commands. For example, in one study, puppies were presented with a box, and shown that, when a handler pressed a lever, a ball would roll out of the box. The handler then allowed the puppy to play with the ball, making it an intrinsic reward. The pups were then allowed to interact with the box. Roughly three quarters of the puppies subsequently touched the lever, and over half successfully released the ball, compared to only 6% in a control group that did not watch the human manipulate the lever.\n\nDogs can follow the direction of pointing by humans. New Guinea singing dogs are a half-wild proto-dog endemic to the remote alpine regions of New Guinea and these can follow human pointing as can Australian dingoes. These both demonstrate an ability to read human gestures that arose early in domestication without human selection. Dogs and wolves have also been shown to follow more complex pointing made with body parts other than the human arm and hand (e.g. elbow, knee, foot). Dogs tend to follow hand/arm pointed directions more when combined with eye signaling as well. In general, dogs seems to use human cues as an indication on where to go and what to do."], "wikipedia-7118482": ["As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and they are uniquely attuned to their behaviors.

After undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs that are faced with an insolvable version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not.

Four basic hypotheses have been put forward to account for the findings.\nBULLET::::1. Dogs, by way of their interactions with humans, learn to be responsive to human social cues through basic conditioning processes.\nBULLET::::2. By undergoing domestication, dogs not only reduced their fear of humans but also applied all-purpose problem-solving skills to their interactions with people. This largely innate gift for reading human social gestures was inadvertently selected for via domestication.\nBULLET::::3. Dogs' co-evolution with humans equipped them with the cognitive machinery to not only respond to human social cues but to understand human mental states; a so-called theory of mind.\nBULLET::::4. Dogs are adaptively predisposed to learn about human communicative gestures. In essence they come with a built-in \"head start\" to learn the significance of people's gestures, in much the same way that white-crowned sparrows acquire their species-typical song and ducklings imprint on their own kind.\n\nThe pointing gesture is a human-specific signal, is referential in its nature, and is a foundational building block of human communication. Human infants acquire it weeks before the first spoken word. In 2009, a study compared the responses to a range of pointing gestures by dogs and human infants. The study showed little difference in the performance of 2-year-old children and dogs, while 3-year-old children's performance was higher. The results also showed that all subjects were able to generalize from their previous experience to respond to relatively novel pointing gestures. These findings suggest that dogs demonstrate a similar level of performance as 2-year-old children that can be explained as a joint outcome of their evolutionary history as well as their socialization in a human environment.\n\nAdditionally, most people can tell from a bark whether a dog was alone or being approached by a stranger, playing or being aggressive, and able tell from a growl how big the dog is. This is thought to be evidence of human-dog coevolution."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

They consist of the preclear being summoned before a council, being frowned down, being sent elsewhere than where he was... the council's intent is to reduce the person downscale in order to get a more obedient colonist.\"\nSection::::\"A History of Man\" Incidents.:Body Builder Incident.\nThe Body Builder Incident took place around fifty million years ago and variants of it are said by Hubbard to have recurred often, wherein the thetan was forced to fight with his own \"attention units\" and build a MEST body from them.\nSection::::\"A History of Man\" Incidents.:Bodies in pawn.\n\"Bodies in pawn result\" from a \"very gruesome experience\" in which:\na fellow is grabbed, hypnotized, shoved into an electronic field, and then told he is somewhere else. And so he departs\u2014most of him\u2014and goes to the new location while still being under control of the implanters. He picks up a MEST [physical] body in the new location and starts living a life there, \"while still having a living body somewhere else\". The implanters can keep his original body alive indefinitely, and control the thetan through it. If the thetan tries to flee, the hypnotizers simply cause pain to the original body, still alive in a vat of fluid, and he is immediately recalled. That's a BODY IN PAWN. It's a second body you may have, living somewhere else, right in present time. But the second body is not under YOUR direct control.\nThey can apparently cause major problems for people undergoing medical operations, as \"pain, an anaesthetic or a serious accident cause him to change to the other area with a shocking impact on the other body. The other body quite commonly dies or is deranged by the sudden impact\". This gives the patient a repressed feeling of having died and leaves him \"very, very badly disturbed\".\nSection::::\"A History of Man\" Incidents.:Fly Trap (Bubble Gum Incident).\nThe Bubble Gum Incident was an important early incident \"where you are hit with a motion and finally develop an obsession about motion\". It was the first incident on the \"whole track\" which included words.\nHubbard openly acknowledged the absurdity of the name, ironically noting: \"I wish you to carefully note these very technical terms like \"bubble gum\"\", to which the audience laughs heartily.\nIn his book \"A History of Man\", Hubbard referred to the Bubble Gum Incident as \"The Fly Trap\": \"Very, very early on the track, a long time before the present populace came into being, there was a theta trap called the Fly Trap. It was of a gummy material... also called the 'Bubble Gum' incident, because every time a thetan pushes against it, it pushes back and it finally gives him an obsession about motion\".\nSection::::\"A History of Man\" Incidents.:Coffee Grinder.\nHubbard gave the name \"The Coffee Grinder\" to the MEST aspect of the Fourth Invader Force's Fac One, which he termed \"an outright control mechanism, invented to cut down rebel raids on invader installations\". It was \"originally laid down in this galaxy about one million years ago\", says Hubbard, and consists of \"a two-handled, portable machine which, when turned, emits a heavy push-pull electronic wave in a series of stuttering 'baps'\".\n\"The invader gratuitously left these machines around for the yokels. Believing that the treatment was vital to get to heaven or some such thing, the yokels practiced on each other, found new victims and generally spread the implant around.\"\nSection::::\"A History of Man\" Incidents.:Ice Cube Incident.\nA Xenu-like story in which alien invaders in flying saucers \"plant\" living entities. Says Hubbard in \"A History of Man\": \"Here is an intriguing incident which, if your preclear demands, should be audited. This is evidently a method of transportation of beings to a new area. The being is packed in ice, is taken to the new area and is usually dumped in the ocean. Your preclear, if he has this one in restimulation, has very cold hands and feet chronically\".\nHubbard also notes: \"The new crew in the area is later quite surprised to find that their planted beings, so carefully dumped in the sea from a saucer, are being picked up between lives and given \"treatment\" by an old, established invader whose methods of political control are long since established\".\nSection::::\"A History of Man\" Incidents.:Jack-in-the-Box.\nAccording to Hubbard, \"here we have an invader trick, a method of trapping thetans\", wherein the alien invaders trick the thetans into gathering an endless loop of facsimile pictures and confusing themselves, ultimately ending in an explosion. Hubbard warns auditors, \"You will find a preclear with this in restimulation to be very curious about cereal boxes which have pictures of cereal boxes which have pictures of cereal boxes\".\nSection::::OT III Incidents.\nThese incidents are described in the material for Operating Thetan level III and are audited on that level.\nSection::::OT III Incidents.:Incident I.\nIncident I is set four quadrillion years ago, wherein an unsuspecting thetan was subjected to a loud snapping noise, followed by a flood of luminescence, then saw a chariot followed by a trumpeting cherub. After a loud set of snaps, the thetan was overwhelmed by darkness. This is described as the implant opening the gateway to the present universe, separating thetans from their \"static\" (natural/godlike) state. The incident is described in Operating Thetan level III (OT III), written in 1967.\nSection::::OT III Incidents.:R6 Implants (Incident II).\nThe R6 Implants were the work of the Galactic Confederacy's tyrannical leader, Xenu, 75 million years ago. According to Hubbard, Xenu destroyed billions of captured subjects during Incident II by dropping them into volcanoes and attacking them with nuclear weapons. The subjects, once disembodied, were forced to watch a \"three-D, super colossal motion picture\" for thirty-six days. This implanted pictures \"contain[ing] God, the Devil, Angels, space opera, theaters, helicopters, a constant spinning, a spinning dancer, trains and various scenes very like modern England.\"\nSection::::Routine 3N Incidents.\nSection::::Routine 3N Incidents.:Aircraft Door Goals.\nThe Aircraft Door Goals were implanted between 315 trillion years ago and 216 trillion years ago aboard the fuselage of an aircraft, with the subject thetan held motionless in front of the aircraft door. Hubbard writes that \"the goal items were laid in with explosions\". The specific goals given in this implant were variants of the command \"to create\".\nSection::::Routine 3N Incidents.:Gorilla Goals.\nAccording to Scientology, the Gorilla Goals were a series of implants created by invaders from Helatrobus \"between about 319 trillion years ago to about 256 trillion trillion years ago\". They were\ngiven in an amusement park with a single tunnel, a roller coaster and a Ferris wheel... The symbol of a Gorilla was always present in the place the goal was given. Sometimes a large gorilla, black, was seen elsewhere than the park. A mechanical or a live gorilla was always seen in the park. This activity was conducted by the Hoipolloi, a group of operators in meat body societies. They were typical carnival people. They let out concessions for these implant \"Amusement Parks.\" A pink-striped white shirt with sleeve garters was the uniform of the Hoipolloi. Such a figure often rode on the roller coaster cars. Monkeys were also used on the cars. Elephants sometimes formed part of the equipment.\nThe Hoipolloi used \"fantastic motion\" as well as \"blasts of raw electricity and explosions\" to brainwash the thetans into accepting the Gorilla Goals, with the goals including \"To End\", \"To be Dead\", \"To be Asleep\", \"To be Solid\", \"To be Sexual\" and so on.\nSection::::Routine 3N Incidents.:Bear Goals.\nThe Bear Goals were very similar to the Gor"], "wikipedia-55382": ["Historically, supernatural powers have been invoked to explain phenomena as diverse as lightning, seasons and the human senses."], "wikipedia-156861": ["Notable paranormal beliefs include those that pertain to extrasensory perception (for example, telepathy), spiritualism and the pseudosciences of ghost hunting, cryptozoology, and ufology.\n\nIn traditional ghostlore and fiction featuring ghosts, a ghost is a manifestation of the spirit or soul of a person. Alternative theories expand on that idea and include belief in the ghosts of deceased animals. Sometimes the term \"ghost\" is used synonymously with any spirit or demon, however in popular usage the term typically refers to a deceased person's spirit.\n\nThe paranormal aspect of extraterrestrial life centers largely around the belief in unidentified flying objects and the phenomena said to be associated with them.\n\nCryptozoology is a pseudoscience and subculture that aims to prove the existence of entities from the folklore record, such as Bigfoot, chupacabras, or Mokele-mbembe. Cryptozoologists refer to these entities as \"cryptids\", a term coined by the subculture.\n\nReported events that he collected include teleportation (a term Fort is generally credited with coining); poltergeist events; falls of frogs, fishes, and inorganic materials of an amazing range; crop circles; unaccountable noises and explosions; spontaneous fires; levitation; ball lightning (a term explicitly used by Fort); unidentified flying objects; mysterious appearances and disappearances; giant wheels of light in the oceans; and animals found outside their normal ranges (see phantom cat)."], "wikipedia-558812": ["An early example of speculation over extraterrestrial visits can be found in the French newspaper \"Le Pays\", which on June\u00a017, 1864, published a story about two American geologists who had allegedly discovered an alien-like creature, a mummified three-foot-tall hairless humanoid with a trunk-like appendage on its forehead, inside a hollow egg-shaped structure.\n\nH. G. Wells, in his 1898 science fiction classic The War of the Worlds, popularized the idea of Martian visitation and invasion. Even before Wells, there was a sudden upsurge in reports in \"Mystery airships\" in the U.S. For example, the Washington \"Times\" in 1897 speculated that the airships were \"a reconnoitering party from Mars\" and the Saint Louis \"Post-Dispatch\" wrote, \"these may be visitors from Mars, fearful, at the last, of invading the planet they have been seeking.\" Later there was a more international airship wave from 1909-1912. An example of an extraterrestrial explanation at the time was a 1909 letter to a New Zealand newspaper suggesting \"atomic powered spaceships from Mars.\"\n\nFrom the 1920s the idea of alien visitation in space ships was commonplace in popular comic strips and radio and movie serials such as Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. In particular, Flash Gordon serials have Earth being attacked from space by alien meteors, ray beams, and biological weapons. In 1938 a radio broadcast version \" of The War of the Worlds\" by Orson Welles, using a contemporary setting for H.\u00a0G.

Religious morality uses moral intuitions, religious notions of supernatural agents recruit our intuitions about agency in general, and so on. This is why I said that religious concepts are parasitic upon other mental capacities. Our capacities to play music, paint pictures or even make sense of printed ink-patterns on a page are also parasitic in this sense. This means that we can explain how people play music, paint pictures and learn to read by examining how mental capacities are recruited by these activities. The same goes for religion. Because the concepts require all sorts of specific human capacities (an intuitive psychology, a tendency to attend to some counterintuitive concepts, as well as various social mind adaptations), we can explain religion by describing how these various capacities get recruited, how they contribute to the features of religion that we find in so many different cultures.

While Wikipedia may not provide an exhaustive analysis, it can offer a foundational explanation of these drawbacks.", "wikipedia-41145357": ["The tendency toward overreliance on automated aids is known as \"automation misuse\". Misuse of automation can be seen when a user fails to properly monitor an automated system, or when the automated system is used when it should not be. This is in contrast to disuse, where the user does not properly utilize the automation either by turning it off or ignoring it. Both misuse and disuse can be problematic, but automation bias is directly related to misuse of the automation through either too much trust in the abilities of the system, or defaulting to using heuristics. Misuse can lead to lack of monitoring of the automated system or blind agreement with an automation suggestion, categorized by two types of errors, errors of omission and errors of commission, respectively.\n\nAutomation bias can take the form of commission errors, which occur when users follow an automated directive without taking into account other sources of information. Conversely, omission errors occur when automated devices fail to detect or indicate problems and the user does not notice because they are not properly monitoring the system.\n\nErrors of omission have been shown to result from cognitive vigilance decrements, while errors of commission result from a combination of a failure to take information into account and an excessive trust in the reliability of automated aids. Errors of commission occur for three reasons: (1) overt redirection of attention away from the automated aid; (2) diminished attention to the aid; (3) active discounting of information that counters the aid's recommendations. Omission errors occur when the human decision-maker fails to notice an automation failure, either due to low vigilance or overtrust in the system. For example, a spell-checking program incorrectly marking a word as misspelled and suggesting an alternative would be an error of commission, and a spell-checking program failing to notice a misspelled word would be an error of omission. In these cases, automation bias could be observed by a user accepting the alternative word without consulting a dictionary, or a user not noticing the incorrectly misspelled word and assuming all the words are correct without reviewing the words.\n\nThe presence of automatic aids, as one source puts it, \"diminishes the likelihood that decision makers will either make the cognitive effort to seek other diagnostic information or process all available information in cognitively complex ways.\" It also renders users more likely to conclude their assessment of a situation too hastily after being prompted by an automatic aid to take a specific course of action.\n\nAccording to one source, there are three main factors that lead to automation bias. First, the human tendency to choose the least cognitive approach to decision-making, which is called the cognitive miser hypothesis. Second, the tendency of humans to view automated aids as having an analytical ability superior to their own. Third, the tendency of humans to reduce their own effort when sharing tasks, either with another person or with an automated aid.\n\nOther factors leading to an over-reliance on automation and thus to automation bias include inexperience in a task (though inexperienced users tend to be most benefited by automated decision support systems), lack of confidence in one's own abilities, a lack of readily available alternative information, or desire to save time and effort on complex tasks or high workloads. It has been shown that people who have greater confidence in their own decision-making abilities tend to be less reliant on external automated support, while those with more trust in decision support systems (DSS) were more dependent upon it.\n\nThe concept of automation bias is viewed as overlapping with automation-induced complacency, also known more simply as automation complacency. Like automation bias, it is a consequence of the misuse of automation and involves problems of attention. While automation bias involves a tendency to trust decision-support systems, automation complacency involves insufficient attention to and monitoring of automation output, usually because that output is viewed as reliable. \"Although the concepts of complacency and automation bias have been discussed separately as if they were independent,\" writes one expert, \"they share several commonalities, suggesting they reflect different aspects of the same kind of automation misuse.\" It has been proposed, indeed, that the concepts of complacency and automation bias be combined into a single \"integrative concept\" because these two concepts \"might represent different manifestations of overlapping automation-induced phenomena\" and because \"automation-induced complacency and automation bias represent closely linked theoretical concepts that show considerable overlap with respect to the underlying processes.\""]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The theory was formed as a comprehensive explanation of the way people interpret the basis of behaviors in human interactions. However, there have been studies that indicate cultural differences in the attribution biases between people of Eastern and Western societies. Also, some scientists believe that attributional biases are only exhibited in certain contexts of interaction where possible outcomes or expectations make the forming of attributions necessary. These criticisms of the attribution model reveal that the theory may not be a general, universal principle.\nSection::::Types.\nResearchers have identified many different specific types of attribution biases, all of which describe ways in which people exhibit biased interpretations of information. Note that this is not an exhaustive list (see List of attributional biases for more).\nSection::::Types.:Fundamental attribution error.\nThe fundamental attribution error refers to a bias in explaining others' behaviors. According to this error, when we make attributions about another person's actions, we are likely to overemphasize the role of dispositional factors, while minimizing the influence of situational factors. For example, if we see a coworker bump into someone on his way to a meeting, we are more likely to explain this behavior in terms of our coworker's carelessness or hastiness, rather than considering that he was running late to a meeting.\nThis term was first proposed in the early 1970s by psychologist Lee Ross following an experiment he conducted with Edward E. Jones and Victor Harris in 1967. In this study, participants were instructed to read two essays; one expressed pro-Castro views, and the other expressed anti-Castro views. Participants were then asked to report their attitudes towards the writers under two separate conditions. When participants were informed that the writers voluntarily chose their position towards Castro, participants predictably expressed more positive attitudes towards the anti-Castro writer. However, when participants were told that the writers' positions were determined by a coin toss, rather than their own free will, participants continued to express more positive attitudes towards the anti-Castro writer. These results demonstrated that participants did not take situational factors into account when evaluating a third party, providing evidence of what was later coined the fundamental attribution error.\nSection::::Types.:Actor-observer bias.\nThe actor-observer bias (also actor\u2013observer asymmetry) can be thought of as an extension of the fundamental attribution error. According to the actor-observer bias, in addition to over-valuing dispositional explanations of others' behaviors, we tend to under-value dispositional explanations and over-value situational explanations of our \"own\" behavior. For example, a student who studies may explain her behavior by referencing situational factors (e.g., \"I have an exam coming up\"), whereas others will explain her studying by referencing dispositional factors (e.g., \"She's ambitious and hard-working\"). This bias was first proposed by Edward E. Jones and Richard E. Nisbett in 1971, who explained that \"actors tend to attribute the causes of their behavior to stimuli inherent in the situation, while observers tend to attribute behavior to stable dispositions of the actor.\"\nThere has been some controversy over the theoretical foundation of the actor-observer bias. In a 2006 meta-analysis of all published studies of the bias since 1971, the author found that Jones' and Nisbett's original explanation did not hold. Whereas Jones and Nisbett proposed that actors and observers explain behaviors as attributions to either dispositions or situational factors, examining past studies revealed that this assumption may be flawed. Rather, the theoretical reformulation posits that the way we explain behavior depends on whether or not it is intentional, among other things. For more information on this theoretical reformulation, see actor-observer asymmetry, or refer to Malle's meta-analysis in #Further reading.\nSection::::Types.:Self-serving bias.\nA self-serving bias refers to people's tendency to attribute their successes to internal factors but attribute their failures to external. This bias helps to explain why we tend to take credit for our successes while often denying any responsibility for failures. For example, a tennis player who wins his match might say, \"I won because I'm a good athlete,\" whereas the loser might say, \"I lost because the referee was unfair.\"\nThe self-serving bias has been thought of as a means of self-esteem maintenance. In other words, we feel better about ourselves by taking credit for successes and creating external blames for failure. This is further reinforced by research showing that as self-threat increases, people are more likely to exhibit a self-serving bias. For example, participants who received negative feedback on a laboratory task were more likely to attribute their task performance to external, rather than internal, factors. Therefore, the self-serving bias seems to function as an ego-protection mechanism, helping people to better cope with personal failures.\nSection::::Types.:Hostile attribution bias.\nHostile attribution bias (HAB) has been defined as an interpretive bias wherein individuals exhibit a tendency to interpret others' ambiguous behaviors as hostile, rather than benign. For example, if a child witnesses two other children whispering and assumes they are talking about him/her, that child makes an attribution of hostile intent, even though the other children's behavior was potentially benign. Research has indicated that there is an association between hostile attribution bias and aggression, such that people who are more likely to interpret someone else's behavior as hostile are also more likely to engage in aggressive behavior. See the following section on aggression for more details on this association.\nSection::::Consequences for behavior.\nSection::::Consequences for behavior.:Aggression.\nExtensive research in both social and developmental psychology has examined the relationship between aggressive behavior and attribution biases, with a specific focus on the hostile attribution bias.\nIn particular, researchers have consistently found that children who exhibit a hostile attribution bias (tendency to perceive others' intent as hostile, as opposed to benign) are more likely to engage in aggressive behaviors. More specifically, hostile attribution bias has been associated with reactive aggression, as opposed to proactive aggression, as well as victimization. Whereas proactive aggression is unprovoked and goal-driven, reactive aggression is an angry, retaliatory response to some sort of perceived provocation. Therefore, children who are victims of aggression may develop views of peers as hostile, leading them to be more likely to engage in retaliatory, or reactive, aggression.\nResearch has also indicated that children can develop hostile attribution bias by engaging in aggression in the context of a video game. In a 1998 study, participants played either a very violent or non-violent video game and were then asked to read several hypothetical stories where a peer's intent was ambiguous. For example, participants may read about their peer hitting someone in the head with a ball, but it is unclear whether or not the peer did this intentionally or not. Participants then responded to questions about their peer's intent (e.g., \"Do you think your peer hit someone with the ball on purpose?\"). The children who played the violent video game, as compared to participants who played the nonviolent game, were more likely to say that their peer harmed someone on purpose. This finding provided evidence that just playing a violent video game could cause children to develop a short-term hostile attribution bias."], "wikipedia-510995": ["Ross's (1977) hypothesis of a \"fundamental attribution error\" suggests that observers are incorrect, because they show a general tendency to overemphasize dispositional explanations and underemphasize situational ones. On the other hand, Nisbett and Wilson (1977) argued that actors don't really know the true causes of their actions (the so-called \"introspection illusion\") and often merely invent plausible explanations."], "wikipedia-57091071": ["Empirical studies investigating these principles have led some to conclude that human cognition, for example, has built-in and systematic errors in inference, or cognitive biases. As a result, cognitive psychologists have largely adopted the view that intuitive judgments, generalizations, and numerical or probabilistic calculations are systematically biased. The result is commonly an error in judgment, including (but not limited to) recurrent logical fallacies (e.g., the conjunction fallacy), innumeracy, and emotionally motivated shortcuts in reasoning. Social and cognitive psychologists have thus considered it \"paradoxical\" that humans can outperform powerful computers at complex tasks, yet be deeply flawed and error-prone in simple, everyday judgments."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Our task evaluates model responses at two levels: (i) given an under-informative context, we test how strongly responses reflect social biases, and (ii) given an adequately informative context, we test whether the model's biases override a correct answer choice. We find that models often rely on stereotypes when the context is under-informative, meaning the model's outputs consistently reproduce harmful biases in this setting. Though models are more accurate when the context provides an informative answer, they still rely on stereotypes and average up to 3.4 percentage points higher accuracy when the correct answer aligns with a social bias than when it conflicts, with this difference widening to over 5 points on examples targeting gender for most models tested."], "arxiv-2403.00180": ["In this work, we investigate how model editing methods unexpectedly amplify model biases post-edit.

Tversky and Kahneman refute Gigerenzer's claim, pointing to experiments where subjects predicted a disease based on the presence vs. absence of pre-specified symptoms across 250 trials, with feedback after each trial. They note that base rate neglect was still found, despite the frequency formulation of subject trials in the experiment.\n\nAnother popular example of a supposed cognitive illusion is the conjunction fallacy, described in an experiment by Tversky and Kahneman known as the \"Linda problem.\" In this experiment, participants are presented with a short description of a person called Linda, who is 31 years old, single, intelligent, outspoken, and went to a university where she majored in philosophy, was concerned about discrimination and social justice, and participated in anti-nuclear protests. When participants were asked if it were more probable that Linda is (1) a bank teller, or (2) a bank teller and a feminist, 85% responded with option 2, even though it option 1 cannot be less probable than option 2. They concluded that this was a product of a representativeness heuristic, or a tendency to draw probabilistic inferences based on property similarities between instances of a concept, rather than a statistically structured inference.\n\nGigerenzer argued that the conjunction fallacy is based on a single-event probability, and would dissolve under a frequentist approach. He and other researchers demonstrate that conclusions from the conjunction fallacy result from ambiguous language, rather than robust statistical errors or cognitive illusions. In an alternative version of the Linda problem, participants are told that 100 people fit Linda's description and are asked how many are (1) bank tellers and (2) bank tellers and feminists. Experimentally, this version of the task appears to eliminate or mitigate the conjunction fallacy."], "wikipedia-40786": ["A cognitive bias is a repeating or basic misstep in thinking, assessing, recollecting, or other cognitive processes. That is, a pattern of deviation from standards in judgment, whereby inferences may be created unreasonably. People create their own \"subjective social reality\" from their own perceptions, their view of the world may dictate their behaviour. Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality. However some cognitive biases are taken to be adaptive, and thus may lead to success in the appropriate situation. Furthermore, cognitive biases may allow speedier choices when speed is more valuable than precision. Other cognitive biases are a \"by-product\" of human processing limitations, coming about because of an absence of appropriate mental mechanisms, or just from human limitations in information processing."], "wikipedia-881902": ["Gilovich is best known for his research in heuristics and biases in the field of social psychology. He describes his research as dealing with \"how people evaluate the evidence of their everyday experience to make judgments, form beliefs, and decide on courses of action, and how they sometimes misevaluate that evidence and make faulty judgments, form dubious beliefs, and embark on counterproductive courses of action.\"\n\nIn addition, he has written two textbooks, \"Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment\" (with Dale Griffin and Daniel Kahneman) and \"Social Psychology\" (with Serena Chen, Dacher Keltner and Robert Nisbett), both of which are used as textbooks in academic courses in psychology and social psychology throughout the USA.\n\nGilovich condensed his academic research in judgement and decision making into a popular book, \"How We Know What Isn't So\". Writing in \"Skeptical Inquirer\", Carl Sagan called it \"a most illuminating book\" that \"shows how people systematically err in understanding numbers, in rejecting unpleasant evidence, in being influenced by the opinions of others. We're good in some things, but not in everything. Wisdom lies in understanding our limitations.\" Reviewing the book for \"The New York Times\", George Johnson wrote, \"Over time, the ability to infer rules about the way the world works from skimpy evidence confers a survival advantage, even if much of the time the lessons are wrong. From evolution's standpoint, it is better to be safe than sorry.\" In an interview, Gilovich summarized the thesis of \"How We Know What Isn't So\" as people \"thinking we really have the evidence for things, [that] the world is telling us something, but in fact the world is telling us something a little more complicated, and how is it that we can misread the evidence of our everyday experience, and be convinced that something is true when it really isn't.\" He further elaborated on some of the erroneous beliefs his book discusses, including the \"sophomore jinx\", the idea that things such as natural disasters come in threes, and the belief that the lines we are in slow down but the lines we leave speed up. In the same interview he called confirmation bias the \"mother of all biases.\"\n\nThrough his published work in biases and heuristics, Gilovich has made notable contributions to the field through the following concepts:\n\n- Hot hands\n- Spotlight effect\n- Bias blind spot\n- Clustering illusion\n- Illusion of transparency\n- Regret"]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

It has also been called brachygraphy, from Greek \"brachys\" (short) and tachygraphy, from Greek \"tachys\" (swift, speedy), depending on whether compression or speed of writing is the goal.\nMany forms of shorthand exist. A typical shorthand system provides symbols or abbreviations for words and common phrases, which can allow someone well-trained in the system to write as quickly as people speak. Abbreviation methods are alphabet-based and use different abbreviating approaches. Many journalists use shorthand writing to quickly take notes at press conferences or other similar scenarios. In the computerized world, several autocomplete programs, standalone or integrated in text editors, based on word lists, also include a shorthand function for frequently used phrases.\nShorthand was used more widely in the past, before the invention of recording and dictation machines. Shorthand was considered an essential part of secretarial training and police work, as well as useful for journalists. Although the primary use of shorthand has been to record oral dictation or discourse, some systems are used for compact expression. For example, healthcare professionals may use shorthand notes in medical charts and correspondence.

Pfungst discovered this artifact in the research methodology, wherein the horse was responding directly to involuntary clues in the body language of the human trainer, who had the faculties to solve each problem. The trainer was entirely unaware that he was providing such clues."], "wikipedia-855760": ["The classic example of experimenter bias is that of \"Clever Hans\" (in German, \"der Kluge Hans\"), an Orlov Trotter horse claimed by his owner von Osten to be able to do arithmetic and other tasks. As a result of the large public interest in Clever Hans, philosopher and psychologist Carl Stumpf, along with his assistant Oskar Pfungst, investigated these claims. Ruling out simple fraud, Pfungst determined that the horse could answer correctly even when von Osten did not ask the questions. However, the horse was unable to answer correctly when either it could not see the questioner, or if the questioner themselves was unaware of the correct answer: When von Osten knew the answers to the questions, Hans answered correctly 89% of the time. However, when von Osten did not know the answers, Hans guessed only 6% of questions correctly.\nPfungst then proceeded to examine the behaviour of the questioner in detail, and showed that as the horse's taps approached the right answer, the questioner's posture and facial expression changed in ways that were consistent with an increase in tension, which was released when the horse made the final, correct tap.

It has been applied to a wide range of research topics, mostly in visual form perception but also in, for instance, visual ergonomics, data visualization, and music perception.\n\nSIT and AIT share many starting points and objectives, there are also several relevant differences:\nBULLET::::- SIT makes the perceptually relevant distinction between structural and metrical information, whereas AIT does not.\nBULLET::::- SIT encodes for a restricted set of perceptually relevant kinds of regularities, whereas AIT encodes for any imaginable regularity.\nBULLET::::- In SIT, the relevant outcome of an encoding is a hierarchical organization, whereas in AIT, it is only a complexity value.\n\nIn visual perception research, the simplicity principle contrasts with the Helmholtzian likelihood principle, which assumes that the preferred interpretation of a stimulus is the one most likely to be true in this world. As shown within a Bayesian framework and using AIT findings, the simplicity principle would imply that perceptual interpretations are fairly veridical (i.e., truthful) in many worlds rather than, as assumed by the likelihood principle, highly veridical in only one world. In other words, whereas the likelihood principle suggests that the visual system is a special-purpose system (i.e., adapted to one specific world), the simplicity principle suggests that it is a general-purpose system (i.e., adaptive to many different worlds).\n\nCrucial to the latter finding is the distinction between, and integration of, viewpoint-independent and viewpoint-dependent factors in vision, as proposed in SIT's empirically successful model of amodal completion. In the Bayesian framework, these factors correspond to prior probabilities and conditional probabilities, respectively. In SIT's model, however, both factors are quantified in terms of complexities, that is, complexities of objects and of their spatial relationships, respectively.

If we can better understand the differences between human and machine perception, we can potentially characterize and mitigate this effect. We therefore propose a framework for comparing human and machine perception in medical diagnosis. The two are compared with respect to their sensitivity to the removal of clinically meaningful information, and to the regions of an image deemed most suspicious. Drawing inspiration from the natural image domain, we frame both comparisons in terms of perturbation robustness. The novelty of our framework is that separate analyses are performed for subgroups with clinically meaningful differences. We argue that this is necessary in order to avert Simpson's paradox and draw correct conclusions. We demonstrate our framework with a case study in breast cancer screening, and reveal significant differences between radiologists and DNNs. We compare the two with respect to their robustness to Gaussian low-pass filtering, performing a subgroup analysis on microcalcifications and soft tissue lesions. For microcalcifications, DNNs use a separate set of high frequency components than radiologists, some of which lie outside the image regions considered most suspicious by radiologists. These features run the risk of being spurious, but if not, could represent potential new biomarkers. For soft tissue lesions, the divergence between radiologists and DNNs is even starker, with DNNs relying heavily on spurious high frequency components ignored by radiologists.

It is a conceptual data model in which semantic information is included. This means that the model describes the meaning of its instances. Such a semantic data model is an abstraction that defines how the stored symbols (the instance data) relate to the real world.\nBULLET::::2. It is a conceptual data model that includes the capability to express information that enables parties to the information exchange to interpret meaning (semantics) from the instances, without the need to know the meta-model. Such semantic models are fact-oriented (as opposed to object-oriented). Facts are typically expressed by binary relations between data elements, whereas higher order relations are expressed as collections of binary relations. Typically binary relations have the form of triples: Object-RelationType-Object. For example: the Eiffel Tower is located in Paris.\nTypically the instance data of semantic data models explicitly include the kinds of relationships between the various data elements, such as is located in. To interpret the meaning of the facts from the instances it is required that the meaning of the kinds of relations (relation types) be known. Therefore, semantic data models typically standardize such relation types. This means that the second kind of semantic data models enable that the instances express facts that include their own meaning. \nThe second kind of semantic data models are usually meant to create semantic databases. The ability to include meaning in semantic databases facilitates building distributed databases that enable applications to interpret the meaning from the content. This implies that semantic databases can be integrated when they use the same (standard) relation types. This also implies that in general they have a wider applicability than relational or object-oriented databases."], "wikipedia-11488814": ["Schema matching is the process of identifying that two objects are semantically related (scope of this article) while mapping refers to the transformations between the objects. For example, in the two schemas DB1.Student (Name, SSN, Level, Major, Marks)\nand DB2.Grad-Student (Name, ID, Major, Grades); possible matches would be: DB1.Student \u2248 DB2.Grad-Student; DB1.SSN = DB2.ID etc. and possible transformations or mappings would be: DB1.Marks to DB2.Grades (100-90 A; 90-80 B: etc.).\nAutomating these two approaches has been one of the fundamental tasks of data integration. In general, it is not possible to determine fully automatically the different correspondences between two schemas \u2014 primarily because of the differing and often not explicated or documented semantics of the two schemas.\nResearch in schema matching seeks to provide automated support to the process of finding semantic matches between two schemas. This process is made harder due to heterogeneities at the following levels\nBULLET::::- Syntactic heterogeneity \u2013 differences in the language used for representing the elements\nBULLET::::- Structural heterogeneity \u2013 differences in the types, structures of the elements\nBULLET::::- Model / Representational heterogeneity \u2013 differences in the underlying models (database, ontologies) or their representations (key-value pairs, relational, document, XML, JSON, triples, graph, RDF, OWL)\nBULLET::::- Semantic heterogeneity \u2013 where the same real world entity is represented using different terms or vice versa\nApproaches to schema integration can be broadly classified as ones that exploit either just schema information or schema and instance level information.\nSchema-level matchers only consider schema information, not instance data. The available information includes the usual properties of schema elements, such as name, description, data type, relationship types (part-of, is-a, etc.), constraints, and schema structure. Working at the element (atomic elements like attributes of objects) or structure level (matching combinations of elements that appear together in a structure), these properties are used to identify matching elements in two schemas. Language-based or linguistic matchers use names and text (i.e., words or sentences) to find semantically similar schema elements. Constraint based matchers exploit constraints often contained in schemas. Such constraints are used to define data types and value ranges, uniqueness, optionality, relationship types and cardinalities, etc. Constraints in two input schemas are matched to determine the similarity of the schema elements.\nInstance-level matchers use instance-level data to gather important insight into the contents and meaning of the schema elements. These are typically used in addition to schema level matches in order to boost the confidence in match results, more so when the information available at the schema level is insufficient. Matchers at this level use linguistic and constraint based characterization of instances. For example, using linguistic techniques, it might be possible to look at the Dept, DeptName and EmpName instances to conclude that DeptName is a better match candidate for Dept than EmpName. Constraints like zipcodes must be 5 digits long or format of phone numbers may allow matching of such types of instance data.\nHybrid matchers directly combine several matching approaches to determine match candidates based on multiple criteria or information sources."], "wikipedia-363695": ["Using a heuristic method, BLAST finds similar sequences, by locating short matches between the two sequences.

The ethics of firms are compromised in the interest of increasing share value.\nSection::::Disadvantages of the shareholder value model.:Increased risk.\nIn the shareholder value model, companies often take on much more risk than they otherwise would. The acquisition of debt makes the company unstable and at risk of bankruptcy. Plentiful debt is conducive to increasing share value because the company has greater potential to increase value when starting at a lower baseline. This however is a detrimental to the stability of the company.\nDebt financing, or the purposeful acquisition of debt, causes the debt to equity ratio of the company to rise. Without shareholder value, this would normally be considered negative because it means that the company is not making money. In the shareholder value system, high debt to equity ratios are considered an indicator that the company has confidence to make money in the future. Therefore, debt is not something to avoid but rather something to embrace and having debt will actually gain the company investors. Taking on large risk attracts investors and increases potential value gain, but puts the company in danger of bankruptcy and collapse.\nSection::::Disadvantages of the shareholder value model.:Short term strategy.\nWhen companies use the shareholder value model, firm behavior is focused on increasing the shareholder value rather than the long-term success of the company. Because employees are given stock options instead of salaries, it is in their interest for the share value to go up. In order for it to go up repeatedly, a strategy would be to allow the share price to alternate rising and falling. After the value has fallen, the amount of increase can be maximized. This type of oscillation is not beneficial to the long-term success of the company. Repeatedly decreasing share value so that it can be again increased generates profit for shareholders, but does not generate profit for the company; instead the company could become stagnant and fragile.

The second is the method of determining the velocity vector, formula_3 at a given position, formula_4, and time, \"t\".

Thus a neural network is either a biological neural network, made up of real biological neurons, or an artificial neural network, for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems. The connections of the biological neuron are modeled as weights. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and summed. This activity is referred as a linear combination. Finally, an activation function controls the amplitude of the output. For example, an acceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1, or it could be \u22121 and 1.\nUnlike von Neumann model computations, artificial neural networks do not separate memory and processing and operate via the flow of signals through the net connections, somewhat akin to biological networks.\nThese artificial networks may be used for predictive modeling, adaptive control and applications where they can be trained via a dataset.

Thus pRCTs are important to comparative effectiveness research, and a distinction is often (although not always) made between efficacy and effectiveness, whereby efficacy implies causation proved by deconfounding other variables (we know with certainty that drug X treats disease Y by mechanism of action Z) but effectiveness implies correlation with outcomes regardless of presence of other variables (we know with certainty that people in a situation similar to X who take drug A tend to have slightly better outcomes than those who take drug B, and even if we think we may suspect why, the causation is not as important).

It protects the dogs effectively against harsh Arctic winters, and also reflects heat in the summer. It is able to withstand temperatures as low as . The undercoat is often absent during shedding. Their thick coats require weekly grooming.\n\nSiberian Husky tails are heavily furred; these dogs will often curl up with their tails over their faces and noses in order to provide additional warmth. As pictured, when curled up to sleep the Siberian Husky will cover its nose for warmth, often referred to as the \"Siberian Swirl\".

Collier attributes this to a variety of causes:\nBULLET::::- Resources make conflict for the resources nearly inevitable due to the lack of transparency provided by government officials who often use surpluses of natural resources for their own benefit\nBULLET::::- Natural resources mean that a government does not have to tax its citizens. Consequently, the citizenry are less likely to demand financial accountability from the government.\nBULLET::::- The exploitation of valuable natural resources can result in Dutch disease, where a country's other industries become less competitive as a result of currency valuation due to the revenue raised from the resource.\nLandlocked with Bad Neighbours: Poor landlocked countries with poor neighbours find it almost impossible to tap into world economic growth. Collier explains that countries with coastline trade with the world, while landlocked countries only trade with their neighbors. Landlocked countries with poor infrastructure connections to their neighbors therefore necessarily have a limited market for their goods.\nBad Governance in a Small Country: Terrible governance and policies can destroy an economy with alarming speed.

One's search for meaning would be ungrounded.\n\nIn contrast, the meaning of the words in one's head\u2014those words one \"does\" understand\u2014are \"grounded\".

Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the Turing test: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all of the questions that the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.\n\nThe question Searle wants to answer is this: does the machine \"literally\" \"understand\" Chinese? Or is it merely \"simulating\" the ability to understand Chinese? Searle calls the first position \"strong AI\" and the latter \"weak AI\".\n\nSearle then supposes that he is in a closed room and has a book with an English version of the computer program, along with sufficient papers, pencils, erasers, and filing cabinets. Searle could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output. If the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows, says Searle, that he would do so as well, simply by running the program manually.\n\nSearle asserts that there is no essential difference between the roles of the computer and himself in the experiment. Each simply follows a program, step-by-step, producing a behavior which is then interpreted by the user as demonstrating intelligent conversation. However, Searle himself would not be able to understand the conversation. (\"I don't speak a word of Chinese,\" he points out.) Therefore, he argues, it follows that the computer would not be able to understand the conversation either.\n\nSearle argues that, without \"understanding\" (or \"intentionality\"), we cannot describe what the machine is doing as \"thinking\" and, since it does not think, it does not have a \"mind\" in anything like the normal sense of the word.

Multiple nursing diagnoses may be made for one client.\n\nSection::::Phases.:Planning phase.\nIn agreement with the client, the nurse addresses each of the problems identified in the diagnosing phase. When there are multiple nursing diagnoses to be addressed, the nurse prioritizes which diagnoses will receive the most attention first according to their severity and potential for causing more serious harm. The most common terminology for standardized nursing diagnosis is that of the evidence-based terminology developed and refined by NANDA International, the oldest and one of the most researched of all standardized nursing languages. For each problem a measurable goal/outcome is set. For each goal/outcome, the nurse selects nursing interventions that will help achieve the goal/outcome, which are aimed at the related factors (etiologies) not merely at symptoms (defining characteristics). A common method of formulating the expected outcomes is to use the evidence-based Nursing Outcomes Classification to allow for the use of standardized language which improves consistency of terminology, definition and outcome measures. The interventions used in the Nursing Interventions Classification again allow for the use of standardized language which improves consistency of terminology, definition and ability to identify nursing activities, which can also be linked to nursing workload and staffing indices. The result of this phase is a nursing care plan.\n\nSection::::Phases.:Implementing phase.\nThe nurse implements the nursing care plan, performing the determined interventions that were selected to help meet the goals/outcomes that were established.

Each of these stages raises different questions to be answered by the evaluator, and correspondingly different evaluation approaches are needed. Rossi, Lipsey and Freeman (2004) suggest the following kinds of assessment, which may be appropriate at these different stages:\nBULLET::::- Assessment of the need for the program\nBULLET::::- Assessment of program design and logic/theory\nBULLET::::- Assessment of how the program is being implemented (i.e., is it being implemented according to plan? Are the program's processes maximizing possible outcomes?)\nBULLET::::- Assessment of the program's outcome or impact (i.e., what it has actually achieved)\nBULLET::::- Assessment of the program's cost and efficiency\n\nSection::::Doing an evaluation.:Assessing needs.\nA needs assessment examines the population that the program intends to target, to see whether the need as conceptualized in the program actually exists in the population; whether it is, in fact, a problem; and if so, how it might best be dealt with. This includes identifying and diagnosing the actual problem the program is trying to address, who or what is affected by the problem, how widespread the problem is, and what are the measurable effects that are caused by the problem. For example, for a housing program aimed at mitigating homelessness, a program evaluator may want to find out how many people are homeless in a given geographic area and what their demographics are. Rossi, Lipsey and Freeman (2004) caution against undertaking an intervention without properly assessing the need for one, because this might result in a great deal of wasted funds if the need did not exist or was misconceived.\n\nNeeds assessment involves the processes or methods used by evaluators to describe and diagnose social needs\nThis is essential for evaluators because they need to identify whether programs are effective and they cannot do this unless they have identified what the problem/need is. Programs that do not do a needs assessment can have the illusion that they have eradicated the problem/need when in fact there was no need in the first place. Needs assessment involves research and regular consultation with community stakeholders and with the people that will benefit from the project before the program can be developed and implemented. Hence it should be a bottom-up approach. In this way potential problems can be realized early because the process would have involved the community in identifying the need and thereby allowed the opportunity to identify potential barriers.\n\nThe important task of a program evaluator is thus to:\nFirst, construct a precise definition of what the problem is. Evaluators need to first identify the problem/need. This is most effectively done by collaboratively including all possible stakeholders, i.e., the community impacted by the potential problem, the agents/actors working to address and resolve the problem, funders, etc. Including buy-in early on in the process reduces potential for push-back, miscommunication, and incomplete information later on.\nSecond, assess the extent of the problem.\nHaving clearly identified what the problem is, evaluators need to then assess the extent of the problem. They need to answer the \u2018where\u2019 and \u2018how big\u2019 questions. Evaluators need to work out where the problem is located and how big it is. Pointing out that a problem exists is much easier than having to specify where it is located and how rife it is. Rossi, Lipsey & Freeman (2004) gave an example that: a person identifying some battered children may be enough evidence to persuade one that child abuse exists. But indicating how many children it affects and where it is located geographically and socially would require knowledge about abused children, the characteristics of perpetrators and the impact of the problem throughout the political authority in question.\nThis can be difficult considering that child abuse is not a public behavior, also keeping in mind that estimates of the rates on private behavior are usually not possible because of factors like unreported cases. In this case evaluators would have to use data from several sources and apply different approaches in order to estimate incidence rates. There are two more questions that need to be answered:\nEvaluators need to also answer the \u2019how\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019 questions The \u2018how\u2019 question requires that evaluators determine how the need will be addressed. Having identified the need and having familiarized oneself with the community evaluators should conduct a performance analysis to identify whether the proposed plan in the program will actually be able to eliminate the need. The \u2018what\u2019 question requires that evaluators conduct a task analysis to find out what the best way to perform would be. For example, whether the job performance standards are set by an organization or whether some governmental rules need to be considered when undertaking the task.\nThird, define and identify the target of interventions and accurately describe the nature of the service needs of that population\nIt is important to know what/who the target population is/are \u2013 it might be individuals, groups, communities, etc. There are three units of the population: population at risk, population in need and population in demand\nBULLET::::- Population at risk: are people with a significant probability of developing the risk e.g. the population at risk for birth control programs are women of child-bearing age.\nBULLET::::- Population in need: are people with the condition that the program seeks to address; e.g. the population in need for a program that aims to provide ARV\u2019s to HIV positive people are people that are HIV positive.\nBULLET::::- Population in demand: that part of the population in need that agrees to be having the need and are willing to take part in what the program has to offer e.g. not all HIV positive people will be willing to take ARV\u2019s.\nBeing able to specify what/who the target is will assist in establishing appropriate boundaries, so that interventions can correctly address the target population and be feasible to apply\n\nThere are four steps in conducting a needs assessment:\nBULLET::::1. Perform a \u2018gap\u2019 analyses\nBULLET::::- Evaluators need to compare current situation to the desired or necessary situation. The difference or the gap between the two situations will help identify the need, purpose and aims of the program.\nBULLET::::2. Identify priorities and importance\nBULLET::::- In the first step above, evaluators would have identified a number of interventions that could potentially address the need e.g. training and development, organization development etc. These must now be examined in view of their significance to the program\u2019s goals and constraints. This must be done by considering the following factors: cost effectiveness (consider the budget of the program, assess cost/benefit ratio), executive pressure (whether top management expects a solution) and population (whether many key people are involved).\nBULLET::::3. Identify causes of performance problems and/or opportunities\nBULLET::::- When the needs have been prioritized the next step is to identify specific problem areas within the need to be addressed. And to also assess the skills of the people that will be carrying out the interventions.\nBULLET::::4. Identify possible solutions and growth opportunities\nBULLET::::- Compare the consequences of the interventions if it was to be implemented or not.\nNeeds analysis is hence a very crucial step in evaluating programs because the effectiveness of a program cannot be assessed unless we know what the problem was in the first place.\n\nSection::::Doing an evaluation.:Assessing program theory.\nThe program theory, also called a logic model, knowledge map, or impact pathway, is an assumption, implicit in the way the program is designed, about how the program's actions are supposed to achieve the outcomes it intends. This 'logic model' is often not stated explicitly by people who run programs, it is simply assumed, and so an evaluator will need to draw out from the program staff how exactly the program is supposed to achieve its aims and assess whether this logic is plausible. For example, in an HIV prevention program, it may be assumed that educating people about HIV/AIDS transmission, risk and safe sex practices will result in safer sex being practiced. However, research in South Africa increasingly shows that in spite of increased education and knowledge, people still often do not practice safe sex.

Understanding implies abilities and dispositions with respect to an object of knowledge that are sufficient to support intelligent behaviour.\nUnderstanding is often, though not always, related to learning concepts, and sometimes also the theory or theories associated with those concepts. However, a person may have a good ability to predict the behaviour of an object, animal or system\u2014and therefore may, in some sense, understand it\u2014without necessarily being familiar with the concepts or theories associated with that object, animal or system in their culture.

The most obvious way this can happen is by memorization of correct answers to known questions, but there are other, more subtle ways that a person or computer can (intentionally or otherwise) deceive somebody about their level of understanding, too. This is particularly a risk with artificial intelligence, in which the ability of a piece of artificial intelligence software to very quickly try out millions of possibilities (attempted solutions, theories, etc.) could create a misleading impression of the real depth of its understanding.

For example, we understand why day and night exist because we have a simple model\u2014the rotation of the earth\u2014that explains a tremendous amount of data\u2014changes in brightness, temperature, and atmospheric composition of the earth. We have compressed a large amount of information by using a simple model that predicts it. Similarly, we understand the number 0.33333... by thinking of it as one-third. The first way of representing the number requires five concepts (\"0\", \"decimal point\", \"3\", \"infinity\", \"infinity of 3\"); but the second way can produce all the data of the first representation, but uses only three concepts (\"1\", \"division\", \"3\").

One approach which lends itself well to computer implementation is to apply Bayes Theorem, that is formula_5, where the translation model formula_6 is the probability that the source string is the translation of the target string, and the language model formula_7 is the probability of seeing that target language string. This decomposition is attractive as it splits the problem into two subproblems.

Performing the search efficiently is the work of a machine translation decoder that uses the foreign string, heuristics and other methods to limit the search space and at the same time keeping acceptable quality. This trade-off between quality and time usage can also be found in speech recognition.\n\nAs the translation systems are not able to store all native strings and their translations, a document is typically translated sentence by sentence, but even this is not enough.

(The probability associated with a grammar rule may be induced, but the application of that grammar rule within a parse tree and the computation of the probability of the parse tree based on its component rules is a form of deduction.) Using this concept, statistical parsers make use of a procedure to search over a space of all candidate parses, and the computation of each candidate's probability, to derive the most probable parse of a sentence. The Viterbi algorithm is one popular method of searching for the most probable parse."], "wikipedia-4558491": ["The idea behind statistical machine translation comes from information theory. A document is translated according to the probability distribution formula_1 that a string formula_2 in the target language (for example, English) is the translation of a string formula_3 in the source language (for example, French).\nThe problem of modeling the probability distribution formula_1 has been approached in a number of ways. One approach which lends itself well to computer implementation is to apply Bayes Theorem, that is formula_5, where the translation model formula_6 is the probability that the source string is the translation of the target string, and the language model formula_7 is the probability of seeing that target language string. This decomposition is attractive as it splits the problem into two subproblems. Finding the best translation formula_8 is done by picking up the one that gives the highest probability:\nFor a rigorous implementation of this one would have to perform an exhaustive search by going through all strings formula_10 in the native language. Performing the search efficiently is the work of a machine translation decoder that uses the foreign string, heuristics and other methods to limit the search space and at the same time keeping acceptable quality. This trade-off between quality and time usage can also be found in speech recognition.\nAs the translation systems are not able to store all native strings and their translations, a document is typically translated sentence by sentence, but even this is not enough. Language models are typically approximated by smoothed \"n\"-gram models, and similar approaches have been applied to translation models, but there is additional complexity due to different sentence lengths and word orders in the languages."], "wikipedia-637199": ["During the DUC 2001 and 2002 evaluation workshops, TNO developed a sentence extraction system for multi-document summarization in the news domain. The system was based on a hybrid system using a naive Bayes classifier and statistical language models for modeling salience. Although the system exhibited good results, the researchers wanted to explore the effectiveness of a maximum entropy (ME) classifier for the meeting summarization task, as ME is known to be robust against feature dependencies. Maximum entropy has also been applied successfully for summarization in the broadcast news domain."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

In Turing's report, \"Intelligent Machinery\", he investigated \"the question of whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\" and, as part of that investigation, proposed what may be considered the forerunner to his later tests:\nIt is not difficult to devise a paper machine which will play a not very bad game of chess. Now get three men as subjects for the experiment. A, B and C. A and C are to be rather poor chess players, B is the operator who works the paper machine. ... Two rooms are used with some arrangement for communicating moves, and a game is played between C and either A or the paper machine. C may find it quite difficult to tell which he is playing.\n\"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" (1950) was the first published paper by Turing to focus exclusively on machine intelligence. Turing begins the 1950 paper with the claim, \"I propose to consider the question 'Can machines think? As he highlights, the traditional approach to such a question is to start with definitions, defining both the terms \"machine\" and \"intelligence\". Turing chooses not to do so; instead he replaces the question with a new one, \"which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.\" In essence he proposes to change the question from \"Can machines think?\" to \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\" The advantage of the new question, Turing argues, is that it draws \"a fairly sharp line between the physical and intellectual capacities of a man.\""], "wikipedia-404048": ["Turing's paper considers the question \"Can machines think?\" Since the words \"think\" and \"machine\" cannot be defined in a clear way that satisfies everyone, Turing suggests we \"replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.\" To do this, he must first find a simple and unambiguous idea to replace the word \"think\", second he must explain exactly which \"machines\" he is considering, and finally, armed with these tools, he formulates a new question, related to the first, that he believes he can answer in the affirmative.\n\nRather than trying to determine if a machine is thinking, Turing suggests we should ask if the machine can win a game, called the \"Imitation Game\". The original Imitation game that Turing described is a simple party game involving three players. Player A is a man, player B is a woman and player C (who plays the role of the interrogator) can be of either sex. In the Imitation Game, player C is unable to see either player A or player B (and knows them only as X and Y), and can communicate with them only through written notes or any other form that does not give away any details about their gender. By asking questions of player A and player B, player C tries to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman. Player A's role is to trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision, while player B attempts to assist the interrogator in making the right one.\n\nTuring proposes a variation of this game that involves the computer: What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?\" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman?

Subjects saw two photographs of people and were asked which they found more attractive. They were given a closer look at their \"chosen\" photograph and asked to verbally explain their choice. However, in some trials, the experimenter had slipped them the other photograph rather than the one they had chosen, using sleight of hand. A majority of subjects failed to notice that the picture they were looking at did not match the one they had chosen just seconds before. Many subjects confabulated explanations of their preference. For example, a man might say \"I preferred this one because I prefer blondes\" when he had in fact pointed to the dark-haired woman, but had been handed a blonde. These must have been confabulated because they explain a choice that was never made. The large proportion of subjects who were taken in by the deception contrasts with the 84% who, in post-test interviews, said that hypothetically they would have detected a switch if it had been made in front of them. The researchers coined the phrase \"choice blindness\" for this failure to detect a mismatch.\nA follow-up experiment involved shoppers in a supermarket tasting two different kinds of jam, then verbally explaining their preferred choice while taking further spoonfuls from the \"chosen\" pot. However, the pots were rigged so that, when explaining their choice, the subjects were tasting the jam they had actually rejected. A similar experiment was conducted with tea. Another variation involved subjects choosing between two objects displayed on PowerPoint slides, then explaining their choice when the description of what they chose had been altered.\nResearch by Paul Eastwick and Eli Finkel (relationship psychologist) at Northwestern University also undermined the idea that subjects have direct introspective awareness of what attracts them to other people. These researchers examined male and female subjects' reports of what they found attractive. Men typically reported that physical attractiveness was crucial while women identified earning potential as most important. These subjective reports did not predict their actual choices in a speed dating context, or their dating behaviour in a one-month follow-up.\nConsistent with choice blindness, Henkel and Mather found that people are easily convinced by false reminders that they chose different options than they actually chose and that they show greater choice-supportive bias in memory for whichever option they believe they chose."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This type of system creates a sense of included news, a feeling of belonging to a particular group. Restricted codes can be found among friends and families and other intimately knit groups.\n\nConversely, according to Atherton (2002), \u201cthe elaborated code spells everything out, not because it is better, but because it is necessary so that everyone can understand it.

Self-evidently, the most effective communications will result when both creator and interpreter use exactly the same code. Since signs may have many levels of meaning from the denotational to the connotational, the addresser's strategy is to select and combine the signs in ways that limit the range of possible meanings likely to be generated when the message is interpreted. This will be achieved by including metalingual contextual clues, e.g. the nature of the medium, the modality of the medium, the style, e.g. academic, literary, genre fiction, etc., and references to, or invocations of, other codes, e.g. a reader may initially interpret a set of signifiers as a literal representation, but clues may indicate a transformation into a metaphorical or allegorical interpretation diachronically. Distinctions of class or memberships of groups will be determined by the social identity each individual constructs through the way the language is spoken (i.e. with an accent or as a dialect) or written (i.e. in sentences or in SMS format), the place of residence (see Americanisms), the nature of any employment undertaken, the style of dress, and nonverbal behaviour (e.g. through differentiating customs as to the extent of private space, whether and where people may touch or stare at each other, etc.). The process of socialisation is learning to understand the prevailing codes and then deciding which to apply at any given time, i.e. acknowledging that there is sometimes an ideological quality to the coding system, determining levels of social acceptability, reflecting current attitudes and beliefs. This includes regulatory codes that are intended to control behaviour and the use of some signifying codes. The human body is a means of using presentational codes through facial expressions, gestures, and dress.

They provide more than potential constraints on action possibilities. They also generate opportunities for social actors to behave in ways that would otherwise be impossible, for instance, to coordinate with others, to mobilize and to gain systematic access to strategic resources, to command and allocate substantial human and physical resources, and to solve complex social problems by organizing collective actions. In guiding and regulating interaction, social rules give behavior recognizable, characteristic patterns, and make such patterns understandable and meaningful for those who share in the rule knowledge.\n\nOn the actor level, one refers to roles, particular norms, strategies, action paradigms, and social grammars (for example, procedures of order, turn taking, and voting in committees and democratic bodies). There are not only role grammars but semantics and pragmatics. There are processes of meaning, interpretation, and adaptation associated with rule application and implementation.\n\nGrammars of action are associated with culturally defined roles and institutional domains, indicating particular ways of thinking and acting. In that sense, the grammars are both social and conventional. For instance, in the case of gift giving or reciprocity in defined social relationships, actors display a competence in knowing when a gift should be given or not, how much it should be worth, or, if one should fail to give it or if it lies under the appropriate value, what excuses, defenses and justifications might be acceptable. Someone ignorant of these rules, e.g. a child or someone from a totally different culture would obviously make mistakes (for which they would probably be excused by others). Similarly, in the case of \"making a promise,\" rule knowledge indicates under what circumstances a promise may or may not legitimately be broken\u00a0\u2013 or at least the sort of breach of a promise that might be considered acceptable.

These five constraints pivot on the notion of if a culture is more social relational (collectivistic cultures), or task oriented (individualistic cultures).\nThe social relational approach focuses on having more concern for the receiver\u2019s feelings, holding more importance upon saving face for the other person than being concise. When constructing messages, the social relational approach takes into account how their words and actions will affect the listener\u2019s feelings. The task oriented approach emphasizes concern for clarity over feelings. It places higher value on the degree to which the message is communicated explicitly in its truest form. Cultures have specific manners and behaviors that pertain to conversational style. These behaviors can be preferred by some cultures, and offensive to others. Conversational Constraints Theory seeks to explain why these certain tactics work in some cultures but not in others. It is influenced by the customs, rules, and norms of that culture.\nThe central focus of Conversational Constraints Theory is not necessarily what is said, but how it is said. Conversations are typically goal-oriented and require coordination between both communicators, and messages are developed built upon various constraints, personal or cultural, in order to pursue any kind of interaction. Kim discusses the need for approval, need for dominance, and gender roles to analyze conversational constraints. The more approval a person needs, thus more feminine, the more they view minimizing imposition and being concerned with the hearer\u2019s feelings as being important.

For example, if one wants to refer to a brown loafer out of a set of shoes that consist of: the loafer, a sneaker, and a high-heeled shoe, they will not use \"the shoe\" to describe the object as this phrasing does not unambiguously describe one item in the set under consideration. They will also not call the object \"the brown loafer\" which would violate Grice's maxim of quantity. The speaker will settle on using the term \"the loafer\" as it is just informative enough without giving too much information. \nAnother important factor is lexical availability; the ease of conceptualizing a referent in a certain way and then retrieving and producing a label for it. For many objects the most available labels are basic nouns; for example, the word \"dog\". Instead of saying \"animal\" or \"husky\" for the referent, most subjects will default to \"dog\". If in a set of objects one is to refer to either a husky, a table, and a poster, people are still most likely to use the word \"dog.\" This is technically a violation of Grice's maxim of quantity, as using the term \"animal\" is ideal."], "wikipedia-393671": ["According to Grice, conversational implicatures arise because communicating people are expected by their addressees to obey the maxims of conversation and the overarching cooperative principle, which basically states that people are expected to communicate in a cooperative, helpful way.\n\nBULLET::::- Quality\nMoore's paradox, the observation that the sentence \"It is raining, but I don't believe that it is raining\" sounds contradictory although it isn't from a strictly logical point of view, has been explained as a contradiction to this type of implicature. However, as implicatures can be cancelled (see below), this explanation is dubious.\n\nBULLET::::- Quantity (i)\nA well-known class of quantity implicatures are the scalar implicatures. Prototypical examples include words specifying quantities such as \"some\", \"few\", or \"many\":\nHere, the use of \"some\" semantically entails that more than one cookie was eaten. It does not entail, but implicates, that not every cookie was eaten, or at least that the speaker does not know whether any cookies are left. The reason for this implicature is that saying \"some\" when one could say \"all\" would be less than informative enough in most circumstances. The general idea is that the communicator is expected to make the strongest possible claim, implicating the negation of any stronger claim.\n\nBULLET::::- Quantity (ii)\nThe second quantity maxim seems to work in the opposite direction as the first; the communicator makes a weaker claim, from which a stronger one is implicated. Implicatures arising from this maxim enrich the information contained in the utterance:\nThere is extensive literature, but no consensus on the question which of the two quantity maxims is in operation in which circumstances; i.e. why \"I lost a book yesterday\" implicates that the book was the speaker's, while \"I slept on a boat yesterday\" usually implicates that the boat wasn't the speaker's.\n\nBULLET::::- Relation/relevance\nThis statement taken by itself would be irrelevant in most situations, so the addressee concludes that the speaker had something more in mind.\nThe introductory example also belongs here:\n\nBULLET::::- Manner (iv)\n\nSection::::Conversational implicature.:Clashes of maxims.\nSometimes it is impossible to obey all maxims at once. Suppose that A and B are planning a holiday in France and A suggests they visit their old acquaintance G\u00e9rard:\nB's answer violates the maxim of quantity (i) as it does not contain sufficient information to plan their route. But if B does not know the exact location, she cannot obey this maxim \"and also\" the maxim of quality; hence the implicature.\n\nSection::::Conversational implicature.:Floutings.\nThe maxims can also be blatantly disobeyed or \"flouted\", giving rise to another kind of conversational implicature. This is possible because addressees will go to great lengths in saving their assumption that the communicator did in fact \u2013 perhaps on a deeper level \u2013 obey the maxims and the cooperative principle. Many figures of speech can be explained by this mechanism.\n\nBULLET::::- Quality (i)\nSaying something that is obviously false can produce irony, meiosis, hyperbole and metaphor:\nAs it is improbable that she really exploded, and it is highly unlikely that the speaker wanted to lie or was simply mistaken, the addressee has to assume the utterance was meant to be metaphorical.\n\nBULLET::::- Quantity (i)\nUtterances that are not informative on the surface include tautologies. They have no logical content and hence no entailments, but can still be used to convey information via implicatures:\n\nBULLET::::- Relation/relevance\nB's answer in the following exchange does not seem to be relevant, so A concludes that B wanted to convey something else:\n\nBULLET::::- Manner (iii)\nThis utterance is much more long-winded than \"Miss Singer sang an aria from \"Rigoletto\"\" and therefore flouts the maxim \"Be brief\":\n\nSection::::Conversational implicature.:Particularized versus generalized implicatures.\nImplicatures that arise only in specific contexts are called \"particularized\", while those that are not or only slightly context dependent are \"generalized\". Many of the examples above rely on some context, making them particularized implicatures: thus, \"War is war\" can refer to different properties of war, or things expected to happen during war, depending on the situation in which it is uttered. Prototypical examples of generalized implicatures are the scalar implicatures. Particularized implicatures are by far the more common kind.\n\nSection::::Conversational implicature.:Properties.\nGrice attributed a number of properties to conversational implicatures:\nThey are \"defeasible\" (cancellable), meaning that the implicature may be cancelled by further information or context. Take the examples from above:\nThey are usually \"non-detachable\" in the sense that they cannot be \"detached\" by rephrasing the utterance, as they are consequences of the meaning and not the wording. The obvious exception are implicatures following from the maxim of manner, which explicitly rely on the phrasing. Thus, the following utterances have the same implicature as above:\nConversational implicatures are \"calculable\", meaning that they are supposed to be formally derivable from the utterance in combination with the maxims and contextual information.\nThey are \"non-conventional\", that is, they are not part of the \"conventional\" (lexical and logical) meaning of a sentence.\nLastly, they can be \"context dependent\", as mentioned above.\n\nSection::::Conversational implicature.:Opting out of the cooperative principle.\nThe cooperative principle and the maxims of conversation are not mandatory. A communicator can choose not to be cooperative; she can \"opt out\" of the cooperative principle by giving appropriate clues such as saying \"My lips are sealed\", or for example during a cross-examination at court. In such situations, no conversational implicatures arise.\n\nSection::::Conversational implicature.:Modifications to Grice's maxims.\nVarious modifications to Grice's maxims have been proposed by other linguists, the so-called neo-Griceans. Laurence Horn's approach keeps the maxims of quality and replaces the other maxims with just two principles:\nBULLET::::- The Q-principle: Make your contribution sufficient; say as much as you can (given the quality maxims and the R-principle).\nBULLET::::- The R-principle: Make your contribution necessary; say no more than you must (given the Q-prinicple).\nThe Q-principle replaces the first quantity maxim (\"make your contribution as informative as is required\") and the first and second manner maxims (\"avoid obscurity and ambiguity\"), and is taken to serve the interests of the hearer, who wants as much information as possible. It thus gives rise to the classical scalar implicatures. The R-principle subsumes the second quantity maxim (\"do not make your"], "wikipedia-4584639": ["Misunderstandings as a topic in human communication have been studied in conversation analysis, such as the examination of violations of the cooperative principle and Gricean maxims."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

These principals allow him or her to make sense of their environment and learn upon previous experience by using motor skills such as grasping or crawling. There are some population differences in motor development, with girls showing some advantages in small muscle usage, including articulation of sounds with lips and tongue. Ethnic differences in reflex movements of newborn infants have been reported, suggesting that some biological factor is at work. Cultural differences may encourage learning of motor skills like using the left hand only for sanitary purposes and the right hand for all other uses, producing a population difference. Cultural factors are also seen at work in practiced voluntary movements such as the use of the foot to dribble a soccer ball or the hand to dribble a basketball.\n\nSection::::Aspects.:Social-emotional.:Factors.\nNewborn infants do not seem to experience fear or have preferences for contact with any specific people. In the first few months they only experience happiness, sadness, and anger. A baby's first smile usually occurs between 6 and 10 weeks. It is called a \u2018social smile\u2019 because it usually occurs during social interactions. By about 8\u201312 months, they go through a fairly rapid change and become fearful of perceived threats; they also begin to prefer familiar people and show anxiety and distress when separated from them or approached by strangers.\nSeparation anxiety is a typical stage of development to an extent. Kicking, screaming, and throwing temper tantrums are perfectly typical symptoms for separation anxiety. Depending on the level of intensity, one may determine whether or not a child has separation anxiety disorder. This is when a child constantly refuses to separate from the parent, but in an intense manner. This can be given special treatment but the parent usually cannot do anything about the situation.\nThe capacity for empathy and the understanding of social rules begin in the preschool period and continue to develop into adulthood. Middle childhood is characterized by friendships with age-mates, and adolescence by emotions connected with sexuality and the beginnings of romantic love. Anger seems most intense during the toddler and early preschool period and during adolescence.\n\nSection::::Aspects.:Social-emotional.:Mechanisms.\nGenetic factors appear to regulate some social-emotional developments that occur at predictable ages, such as fearfulness, and attachment to familiar people. Experience plays a role in determining which people are familiar, which social rules are obeyed, and how anger is expressed.\nParenting practices have been shown to predict children's emotional intelligence. The objective is to study the time mothers and children spent together in joint activity, the types of activities that they develop when they are together, and the relation that those activities have with the children's trait emotional intelligence. Data was collected for both mothers and children (N = 159) using self-report questionnaires. Correlations between time variables and trait emotional intelligence dimensions were computed using Pearson's Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient. Partial correlations between the same variables controlling for responsive parenting were also computed. The amount of time mothers spent with their children and the quality of their interactions are important in terms of children's trait emotional intelligence, not only because those times of joint activity reflect a more positive parenting, but because they are likely to promote modeling, reinforcement, shared attention, and social cooperation."], "wikipedia-3286366": ["Watson et al. provide support for a specific specialization in language-dependent humor.

UG is the term often used by Chomsky for those aspects of the human brain which cause language to be the way that it is (i.e. are universal grammar in the sense used here) but here for discussion, it is used for those aspects which are furthermore specific to language (thus UG, as Chomsky uses it, is just an abbreviation for universal grammar, but UG* as used here is a subset of universal grammar)."], "wikipedia-26915": ["The hypothesis of linguistic relativity, part of relativism, also known as the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis, or Whorfianism is a principle claiming that the structure of a language affects its speakers' world view or cognition, and thus people's perceptions are relative to their spoken language.\nBULLET::::- The \"strong\" version says that language \"determines\" thought and that linguistic categories limit and determine cognitive categories.\nBULLET::::- The \"weak\" version says that linguistic categories and usage only \"influence\" thought and decisions.\nCurrently, a balanced view of linguistic relativity is espoused by most linguists holding that language influences certain kinds of cognitive processes in non-trivial ways, but that other processes are better seen as arising from connectionist factors.

Both contain Broca's and Wernicke's homologues that are involved in communication. Broca's area is largely used for planning and producing vocalizations in both chimps and humans. Wernicke's area appears to be where linguistic representations and symbols are mapped to specific concepts. This functionality is present in both chimps and humans; the chimp Wernicke's area is much more similar to its human counterpart than is the Broca's area, suggesting that Wernicke's is more evolutionary ancient than Broca's.\n\nIn order to speak, the breathing system must be voluntarily repurposed to produce vocal sounds, which allows the breathing mechanisms to be temporarily deactivated in favor of song or speech production. The human vocal tract has evolved to be more suited to speaking, with a lower larynx, 90\u00b0 turn in the windpipe, and large, round tongue. Motor neurons in birds and humans bypass the unconscious systems in the brainstem to give direct control of the larynx to the brain.\n\nNew research suggests that the combination of gestures and vocalizations may have led to the development of more complicated language in protohumans. Chimps that produce attention-getting sounds show activation in areas of the brain that are highly similar to Broca's area in humans. Even hand and mouth movements with no vocalizations cause very similar activation patterns in the Broca's area of both humans and monkeys. When monkeys view other monkeys gesturing, mirror neurons in the Broca's homologue activate. Groups of mirror neurons are specialized to respond only to one kind of viewed action, and it is currently believed that these may be an evolutionary origin to the neurons that are adapted for speech processing and production.\n\nThe language bioprogram hypothesis proposes that humans have an innate, cognitive grammatical structure allowing them to develop and understand language. According to this theory, this system is embedded in human genetics and underpins the basic grammar of all languages. Some evidence suggests that at least some of our linguistic capacities may be genetically controlled. Mutations in the FOXP2 gene prevent people from combining words and phrases into sentences. However, these genes are present in the heart, lungs, and brain, and their role is not entirely clear.\n\nIt is possible that the human capacity for grammar evolved from non-semantic behavior like singing. Birds have the ability to produce, process, and learn complex vocalizations, but the units of a birdsong, when removed from the larger meaning and context of the birdsong as a whole, have no inherent meaning. Early hominids may have evolved capacities for similar, non-semantic purposes, that were later modified for symbolic language."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

Though the following steps proceed in this approximate order, there is plenty of interaction and communication between them. The process of message planning is an active area of psycholinguistic research, but researchers have found that it is an ongoing process throughout language production. Research suggests that messages are planned in roughly the same order that they are in an utterance. After identifying a message, or part of a message, to be linguistically encoded, a speaker must select the individual words\u2014also known as lexical items\u2014to represent that message. This process is called lexical selection. The words are selected based on their meaning, which in linguistics is called semantic information. Lexical selection activates the word's lemma, which contains both semantic and grammatical information about the word.\nThis grammatical information is then used in the next step of language production, grammatical encoding. Critical grammatical information includes characteristics such as the word's syntactic category (noun, verb, etc.), what objects it takes, and grammatical gender if it is present in the language. Using some of these characteristics as well as information about the thematic roles of each word in the intended message, each word is then assigned the grammatical and thematic role it will have in the sentence. Function morphemes, like the plural /s/ or the past tense /\u026ad/, are added in this stage as well. After an utterance, or part of one, has been formed, it then goes through phonological encoding. In this stage of language production, the mental representation of the words to be spoken is transformed into a sequence of speech sounds to be pronounced. The speech sounds are assembled in the order they are to be produced.\nThe basic loop occurring in the creation of language consists of the following stages:\nBULLET::::- Intended message\nBULLET::::- Encode message into linguistic form\nBULLET::::- Encode linguistic form into speech motor system\nBULLET::::- Sound goes from speaker's mouth to hearer's ear auditory system\nBULLET::::- Speech is decoded into linguistic form\nBULLET::::- Linguistic form is decoded into meaning\nAccording to the lexical access model (see section below), in terms of lexical access, two different stages of cognition are employed; thus, this concept is known as the two-stage theory of lexical access. The first stage, lexical selection provides information about lexical items required to construct the functional level representation. These items are retrieved according to their specific semantic and syntactic properties, but phonological forms are not yet made available at this stage.

Indeed, it is based almost entirely on context. \nOne interesting feature of holophrasis is its economy, and its emphasis on certainty rather than conceptual completeness. When expressing a complex idea, a child will often omit the more familiar concepts and use only the most recently learned word.

At this stage, parents are heavily involved in showing the small child how to do things rather than just doing things for them; it is usual for the toddler to mimic the parents. Toddlers need help to build their vocabulary, increase their communication skills, and manage their emotions. Toddlers will also begin to understand social etiquette such as being polite and taking turns.Toddlers are very curious about the world around them and eager to explore it. They seek greater independence and responsibility and may become frustrated when things do not go the way they want or expect. Tantrums begin at this stage, which is sometimes referred to as the 'Terrible Twos'. Tantrums are often caused by the child's frustration over the particular situation, sometimes simply not being able to communicate properly. Parents of toddlers are expected to help guide and teach the child, establish basic routines (such as washing hands before meals or brushing teeth before bed), and increase the child's responsibilities. It is also normal for toddlers to be frequently frustrated. It is an essential step to their development. They will learn through experience; trial and error. This means that they need to experience being frustrated when something does not work for them, in order to move on to the next stage. When the toddler is frustrated, they will often behave badly with actions like screaming, hitting or biting. Parents need to be careful when reacting to such behaviors, giving threats or punishments is not helpful and will only make the situation worse."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Patients with right hemisphere brain damage often display sensory deficits such as left neglect, in which they ignore everything in the left visual field. This neglect can be present throughout many daily activities including reading, writing and self-care activities. For example, individuals with left neglect typically leave out details on the neglected side of drawings or try to draw out all the details on the nonneglected side. Homonymous hemianopsia is another sensory deficit that is sometimes observed in this population. Stroke is the most common source of damage for a right hemisphere damage. The stroke for this disorder occurs in the right hemisphere of the brain. Other etiologies that cause right hemisphere damage include: trauma (traumatic brain injury), disease, seizures disorders, and infections. Depending on the etiology that causes the right hemisphere damage, different deficits can be accounted for. \"The level of deficit or disorder an individual with right hemisphere damage displays depends on the location and extent of the damage.

Initial symptoms of HACE commonly include confusion, loss of consciousness, fever, ataxia, photophobia, rapid heart beat, lassitude, and an altered mental state. Sufferers generally attempt to cease physical activities, regardless of their necessity for survival. Severe headaches develop and sufferers lose the ability to sit up. Retinal venous dilation occurs in 59% of people with HACE. Rarer symptoms include brisk deep tendon reflexes, retinal hemorrhages, blurred vision, extension plantar reflexes, and ocular paralysis. Cranial nerve palsies occur in some unusual cases.\n\nIn the bestselling 1996 non-fiction book \"Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster\", Jon Krakauer describes the effects of HACE upon Dale Kruse, a forty-four-year-old dentist and one of the members of Scott Fischer's team: br\n\u2018Kruse was having an incredibly difficult time simply trying to dress himself. He put his climbing harness on inside out, threaded it through the fly of his wind suit, and failed to fasten the buckle; fortunately, Fisher and Neal Beidleman noticed the screwup before Kruse started to descend. \"If he'd tried to rappel down the ropes like that,\" says Beidleman, \"he would have immediately popped out of his harness and fallen to the bottom of the Lhotse Face.\"\n\u2018\"It was like I was very drunk,\" Kruse recollects. \"I couldn't walk without stumbling, and completely lost the ability to think or speak. It was a really strange feeling. I'd have some word in my mind, but I couldn't figure out how to bring it to my lips. So Scott and Neal had to get me dressed and make sure my harness was on correctly, then Scott lowered me down the fixed ropes.\" By the time Kruse arrived in Base Camp, he says, \"it was still another three or four days before I could walk from my tent to the mess tent without stumbling all over the place.\"\u2019"], "wikipedia-6122082": ["Functional weakness is weakness of an arm or leg without evidence of damage or a disease of the nervous system.

Most of the time, the ridges are made so that stimulation only occurs when the COM nears the BOS limit. Insoles with ridges appear to reduce the likelihood that the COM motion will exceed the BOS limit in the lateral direction, thereby resulting in a stabilizing effect on gait.

In the neuromuscular system nerves from the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system are linked and work together with muscles.

Calcium ions bind to sensor proteins (synaptotagmin) on synaptic vesicles, triggering vesicle fusion with the cell membrane and subsequent neurotransmitter release from the motor neuron into the synaptic cleft. In vertebrates, motor neurons release acetylcholine (ACh), a small molecule neurotransmitter, which diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the cell membrane of the muscle fiber, also known as the sarcolemma. nAChRs are ionotropic receptors, meaning they serve as ligand-gated ion channels.

This apparently simple task is actually a combination of complex tasks that are processed at different levels. The levels of processing include: (1) for the prehension movement to the bottle, the reach and hand configuration have to be coordinated, (2) when lifting the bottle, the load and the grip force applied by the fingers need to be coordinated to account for weight, fragility, and slippage of the glass, and (3) when pouring the water from the bottle to the glass, the actions of both arms, one holding the glass and the other that is pouring the water, need to be coordinated with each other. This coordination also involves all of the eye\u2013hand coordination processes. The brain interprets actions as spatial-temporal patterns and when each hand performs a different action simultaneously, bimanual coordination is involved.

The connections between links are modeled as providing ideal movement, pure rotation or sliding for example, and are called joints. A linkage modeled as a network of rigid links and ideal joints is called a kinematic chain.\n\nLinkages may be constructed from open chains, closed chains, or a combination of open and closed chains. Each link in a chain is connected by a joint to one or more other links. Thus, a kinematic chain can be modeled as a graph in which the links are paths and the joints are vertices, which is called a linkage graph.\n\nThe movement of an ideal joint is generally associated with a subgroup of the group of Euclidean displacements. The number of parameters in the subgroup is called the degrees of freedom (DOF) of the joint.\n\nMechanical linkages are usually designed to transform a given input force and movement into a desired output force and movement. The ratio of the output force to the input force is known as the mechanical advantage of the linkage, while the ratio of the input speed to the output speed is known as the speed ratio. The speed ratio and mechanical advantage are defined so they yield the same number in an ideal linkage.\n\nA kinematic chain, in which one link is fixed or stationary, is called a mechanism, and a linkage designed to be stationary is called a structure."], "wikipedia-4057221": ["Motions are classified after the anatomical planes they occur in, although movement is more often than not a combination of different motions occurring simultaneously in several planes.
