According to COSO, these components provide an effective framework for describing and analyzing the internal control system implemented in an organization as required by financial regulations (see Securities Exchange Act of 1934,) The five components are the following:\nControl environment: The control environment sets the tone of an organization, influencing the control consciousness of its people. It is the foundation for all other components of internal control, providing discipline and structure. Control environment factors include the integrity, ethical values, management's operating style, delegation of authority systems, as well as the processes for managing and developing people in the organization.\nRisk assessment: Every entity faces a variety of risks from external and internal sources that must be assessed. A precondition to risk assessment is establishment of objectives and thus risk assessment is the identification and analysis of relevant risks to the achievement of assigned objectives. Risk assessment is a prerequisite for determining how the risks should be managed.\nControl activities: Control activities are the policies and procedures that help ensure management directives are carried out. They help ensure that necessary actions are taken to address the risks that may hinder the achievement of the entity's objectives. Control activities occur throughout the organization, at all levels and in all functions. They include a range of activities as diverse as approvals, authorizations, verifications, reconciliations, reviews of operating performance, security of assets and segregation of duties.\nInformation and communication: Information systems play a key role in internal control systems as they produce reports, including operational, financial and compliance-related information, that make it possible to run and control the business. In a broader sense, effective communication must ensure information flows down, across and up the organization. For example, formalized procedures exist for people to report suspected fraud. Effective communication should also be ensured with external parties, such as customers, suppliers, regulators and shareholders about related policy positions.\nMonitoring: Internal control systems need to be monitored\u2014a process that assesses the quality of the system's performance over time.

Therefore, it requires keeping track of how the decision situation is evolving over time. The information about the current situation that is needed to make a correct decision is called the \"state\". For example, to decide how much to consume and spend at each point in time, people would need to know (among other things) their initial wealth. Therefore, wealth formula_1 would be one of their \"state variables\", but there would probably be others.\n\nThe variables chosen at any given point in time are often called the \"control variables\". For example, given their current wealth, people might decide how much to consume now. Choosing the control variables now may be equivalent to choosing the next state; more generally, the next state is affected by other factors in addition to the current control. For example, in the simplest case, today's wealth (the state) and consumption (the control) might exactly determine tomorrow's wealth (the new state), though typically other factors will affect tomorrow's wealth too.\n\nThe dynamic programming approach describes the optimal plan by finding a rule that tells what the controls should be, given any possible value of the state. For example, if consumption (\"c\") depends \"only\" on wealth (\"W\"), we would seek a rule formula_2 that gives consumption as a function of wealth. Such a rule, determining the controls as a function of the states, is called a \"policy function\" (See Bellman, 1957, Ch. III.2).\n\nFinally, by definition, the optimal decision rule is the one that achieves the best possible value of the objective. For example, if someone chooses consumption, given wealth, in order to maximize happiness (assuming happiness \"H\" can be represented by a mathematical function, such as a utility function and is something defined by wealth), then each level of wealth will be associated with some highest possible level of happiness, formula_3. The best possible value of the objective, written as a function of the state, is called the \"value function\".\n\nRichard Bellman showed that a dynamic optimization problem in discrete time can be stated in a recursive, step-by-step form known as backward induction by writing down the relationship between the value function in one period and the value function in the next period. The relationship between these two value functions is called the \"Bellman equation\". In this approach, the optimal policy in the last time period is specified in advance as a function of the state variable's value at that time, and the resulting optimal value of the objective function is thus expressed in terms of that value of the state variable. Next, the next-to-last period's optimization involves maximizing the sum of that period's period-specific objective function and the optimal value of the future objective function, giving that period's optimal policy contingent upon the value of the state variable as of the next-to-last period decision. This logic continues recursively back in time, until the first period decision rule is derived, as a function of the initial state variable value, by optimizing the sum of the first-period-specific objective function and the value of the second period's value function, which gives the value for all the future periods. Thus, each period's decision is made by explicitly acknowledging that all future decisions will be optimally made."], "wikipedia-102140": ["Perturbation methods start with a simplified form of the original problem, which is \"simple enough\" to be solved exactly. In celestial mechanics, this is usually a Keplerian ellipse. Under non-relativistic gravity, an ellipse is exactly correct when there are only two gravitating bodies (say, the Earth and the Moon) but not quite correct when there are three or more objects (say, the Earth, Moon, Sun, and the rest of the solar system) and not quite correct when the gravitational interaction is stated using formulations from General relativity.\nThe solved, but simplified problem is then \"\"perturbed\"\" to make the conditions that the perturbed solution actually satisfies closer to the formula in the original problem, such as including the gravitational attraction of a third body (the Sun). Typically, the \"conditions\" that represent reality are a formula (or several) that specifically express some physical law, like Newton's second law, the force-acceleration equation,\nIn the case of the example, the force is calculated based on the number of gravitationally relevant bodies; the acceleration is obtained, using calculus, from the path of the Moon in its orbit. Both of these come in two forms: approximate values for force and acceleration, which result from simplifications, and hypothetical exact values for force and acceleration, which would require the complete answer to calculate.\nThe slight changes that result from accommodating the perturbation, which themselves may have been simplified yet again, are used as corrections to the approximate solution. Because of simplifications introduced along every step of the way, the corrections are never perfect, and the conditions met by the corrected solution do not perfectly match the equation demanded by reality. However, even only one cycle of corrections often provides an excellent approximate answer to what the real solution should be.\nThere is no requirement to stop at only one cycle of corrections. A partially corrected solution can be re-used as the new starting point for yet another cycle of perturbations and corrections. In principle, cycles of finding increasingly better corrections could go on indefinitely. In practice, one typically stops at one or two cycles of corrections. The usual difficulty with the method is that the corrections progressively make the new solutions very much more complicated, so each cycle is much more difficult to manage than the previous cycle of corrections. Isaac Newton is reported to have said, regarding the problem of the Moon's orbit, that \"\"It causeth my head to ache.\"\"\nThis general procedure is a widely used mathematical tool in advanced sciences and engineering: start with a simplified problem and gradually add corrections that make the formula that the corrected problem becomes a closer and closer match to the original formula."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-1180800": 1, "wikipedia-1278389": 3, "wikipedia-1236458": 1, "wikipedia-35138969": 1, "wikipedia-102140": 2, "wikipedia-854461": 1, "wikipedia-23256783": 1, "wikipedia-8397393": 1, "wikipedia-43170941": 1, "wikipedia-53632446": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-1180800": 1, "wikipedia-1278389": 3, "wikipedia-1236458": 2, "wikipedia-35138969": 1, "wikipedia-102140": 3, "wikipedia-854461": 1, "wikipedia-23256783": 1, "wikipedia-8397393": 1, "wikipedia-43170941": 1, "wikipedia-53632446": 1}}}

This special role has led to the discovery of close connections to a diversity of other fields, such as knot theory, geometric group theory, hyperbolic geometry, number theory, Teichm\u00fcller theory, topological quantum field theory, gauge theory, Floer homology, and partial differential equations. 3-manifold theory is considered a part of low-dimensional topology or geometric topology.\nA key idea in the theory is to study a 3-manifold by considering special surfaces embedded in it. One can choose the surface to be nicely placed in the 3-manifold, which leads to the idea of an incompressible surface and the theory of Haken manifolds, or one can choose the complementary pieces to be as nice as possible, leading to structures such as Heegaard splittings, which are useful even in the non-Haken case.\nThurston's contributions to the theory allow one to also consider, in many cases, the additional structure given by a particular Thurston model geometry (of which there are eight). The most prevalent geometry is hyperbolic geometry. Using a geometry in addition to special surfaces is often fruitful.\nThe fundamental groups of 3-manifolds strongly reflect the geometric and topological information belonging to a 3-manifold. Thus, there is an interplay between group theory and topological methods."], "wikipedia-28305": ["In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics. Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.\n\nCompactification is one way of modifying the number of dimensions in a physical theory. In compactification, some of the extra dimensions are assumed to \"close up\" on themselves to form circles. In the limit where these curled up dimensions become very small, one obtains a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions. A standard analogy for this is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length. However, as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling on the surface of the hose would move in two dimensions.\n\nAnother approach to reducing the number of dimensions is the so-called brane-world scenario. In this approach, physicists assume that the observable universe is a four-dimensional subspace of a higher dimensional space. In such models, the force-carrying bosons of particle physics arise from open strings with endpoints attached to the four-dimensional subspace, while gravity arises from closed strings propagating through the larger ambient space. This idea plays an important role in attempts to develop models of real world physics based on string theory, and it provides a natural explanation for the weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-3054853": 1, "wikipedia-5253859": 1, "wikipedia-2336224": 1, "wikipedia-30323162": 1, "wikipedia-697155": 1, "wikipedia-1018257": 1, "wikipedia-45475440": 1, "wikipedia-28305": 1, "wikipedia-65309": 1, "wikipedia-29150377": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-3054853": 1, "wikipedia-5253859": 1, "wikipedia-2336224": 1, "wikipedia-30323162": 1, "wikipedia-697155": 1, "wikipedia-1018257": 2, "wikipedia-45475440": 1, "wikipedia-28305": 2, "wikipedia-65309": 1, "wikipedia-29150377": 1}}}

These two derivatives are linear transformations and , respectively, so they can be composed. The chain rule for total derivatives is that their composite is the total derivative of at :\nor for short,\nThe higher-dimensional chain rule can be proved using a technique similar to the second proof given above.\nBecause the total derivative is a linear transformation, the functions appearing in the formula can be rewritten as matrices. The matrix corresponding to a total derivative is called a Jacobian matrix, and the composite of two derivatives corresponds to the product of their Jacobian matrices. From this perspective the chain rule therefore says:\nor for short,\nThat is, the Jacobian of a composite function is the product of the Jacobians of the composed functions (evaluated at the appropriate points).\nThe higher-dimensional chain rule is a generalization of the one-dimensional chain rule.

Each different situation will lead to a different set of rules, or a separate calculus, using the broader sense of the term.

For a scalar function of three independent variables, formula_1, the gradient is given by the vector equation\nwhere formula_3 represents a unit vector in the formula_4 direction for formula_5. This type of generalized derivative can be seen as the derivative of a scalar, \"f\", with respect to a vector, formula_6, and its result can be easily collected in vector form.\n\nMore complicated examples include the derivative of a scalar function with respect to a matrix, known as the gradient matrix, which collects the derivative with respect to each matrix element in the corresponding position in the resulting matrix.

Bob then measures the pulses from Alice by identifying a random basis \u03b2. Bob records these photons and then reports back the first successfully measured photon \"j\" to Alice along with a random bit \"b\".\nBULLET::::3. Alice reveals the basis and bit that she used at the basis Bob gave her. If the two bases and bits match, then both parties are truthful and can exchange information. If the bit reported by Bob is different than that of Alice's, one is not being truthful.\nA more general explanation of the above protocol is as follows:\nBULLET::::1. Alice first chooses a random basis (such as diagonally) and a sequence of random qubits. Alice then encodes her chosen qubits as a sequence of photons following the chosen basis. She then sends these qubits as a train of polarized photons to Bob through the communication channel.\nBULLET::::2. Bob chooses a sequence of reading bases randomly for each individual photon. He then reads the photons and records the results in two tables. One table is of the rectilinear (horizontal or vertical) received photons and one of the diagonally received photons. Bob may have holes in his tables due to losses in his detectors or in the transmission channels. Based on this table, Bob makes a guess as to which basis Alice used and announces his guess to Alice. If he guessed correctly, he wins and if not, he loses.\nBULLET::::3. Alice reports whether he won or not by announcing what basis she used to Bob. Alice then confirms the information by sending Bob her entire original qubit sequence that she used in step 1.\nBULLET::::4. Bob compares Alice's sequence with his tables to confirm that no cheating occurred on Alice's part. The tables should correspond to Alice's basis and there should be no correlation with the other table."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-52454494": 1, "wikipedia-2056753": 1, "wikipedia-19621522": 1, "wikipedia-5498192": 1, "wikipedia-12819285": 1, "wikipedia-53585937": 1, "wikipedia-494410": 1, "wikipedia-12155118": 1, "wikipedia-12286078": 1, "wikipedia-36617985": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-52454494": 1, "wikipedia-2056753": 1, "wikipedia-19621522": 1, "wikipedia-5498192": 1, "wikipedia-12819285": 1, "wikipedia-53585937": 2, "wikipedia-494410": 1, "wikipedia-12155118": 1, "wikipedia-12286078": 1, "wikipedia-36617985": 1}}}

Its aim is to provide a characterization of the conceptual elements by which a person understands words and sentences, and thus to provide \"an explanatory semantic representation\" (title of a Jackendoff 1976 paper). \"Explanatory\" in this sense refers to the ability of a given linguistic theory to describe how a component of language is acquired by a child (as proposed by Noam Chomsky; see Levels of adequacy).\n\nRecently, conceptual semantics in particular, and lexical semantics in general, have taken on increasing importance in linguistics and psycholinguistics. Many contemporary theories of syntax (how sentences are constructed from individual words) rely on elements that are idiosyncratic to words themselves. As a result, a sound theory accounting for the properties of the meanings of words is required.\n\nJackendoff has claimed that the goal of conceptual semantics is to investigate:\n\nConceptual semantics distinguishes a single, universal meaning to a word. Instead of having a lexical semantic meaning in addition to the conceptual representation of the actual referent, here the two are combined into what Jackendoff calls \"lexical concepts\" (Murphy 2010:59). Conceptual semantics is considered to be not just a linguistic theory, but a theory on human cognition. Like many semantic theories, Jackendoff claims that a decompositional method is necessary to explore conceptualization. Just as one of the ways a physical scientist tries to understand matter is by breaking it down into progressively smaller parts, so a scientific study of conceptualization proceeds by breaking down, or decomposing, meanings into smaller parts. However, this decomposition cannot go on forever, for at some point, meanings can no longer be broken down.\n\nThis is the level of conceptual structure, the level of mental representations which encode the human understanding of the world, containing the primitive conceptual elements out of which meanings are built, plus their rules of combination. Conceptual semantics does not work with a mental dictionary, in the classical sense. There are no definitions attached to concepts and reference, only the idea of the concept or reference itself. Just as generative syntax posits a finite set of syntactic categories and rules for combining them, so, too, does Conceptual Semantics posit 'a finite set of mental primitives and a finite set of principles of mental combination' governing their interaction (Jackendoff 1990: 9). Jackendoff refers to this set of primitives and the rules governing them as the 'grammar of sentential concepts' (Jackendoff 1990: 9).\n\nHis starting point is a close analysis of the meanings of lexemes dedicated to bringing out parallelisms and contrasts which reveal the nature of the conceptual structures underlying them. Jackendoff considers the lexicon to be made of three parts: phonological, syntactic, and conceptual. These three aspects of a concept give a \"full picture of a word\" (Murphy 2010:60). What his method shows, he says, is that the psychological organization on which meaning rests 'lies a very short distance below the surface of everyday lexical items \u2013\nand that progress can be made in exploring it' (1991: 44).\n\nJackendoff claims that a decompositional method is necessary to explore conceptual structure, in which the concepts underlying word\nmeaning are broken down into their smallest elements: conceptual primitives envisaged as the semantic equivalents of phonological features. Conceptual Semantics posits 'a finite set of mental primitives and a finite set of principles of mental combination' governing their interaction. The conceptual structure of a lexical item is an element with zero or more open argument slots, which are filled by the syntactic complements of the lexical item.\n\nConceptual semantics breaks lexical concepts up into ontological categories: events, states, places, amounts, things, and property, to name a few. These ontological categories are called semantic primes, or semantic primitives. Jackendoff poses that any concept in the human brain can be expressed using these semantic primes. Conceptual semantics is compositional, in that the meanings of phrases, clauses, and sentences can be determined from the lexical concepts that make them up.

Specifically, insight involves three different processes (selective encoding, combination, and comparison), which require intelligence to apply to problems. Selective encoding is the process of focusing attention on ideas relevant to a solution, while ignoring features that are irrelevant. Selective combination is the process of combining the information previously deemed relevant. Finally, selective comparison is the use of past experience with problems and solutions that are applicable to the current problem and solution.\n\nAccording to the four-stage model of insight, there are four stages to problem solving. First, the individual prepares to solve a problem. Second, the individual incubates on the problem, which encompasses trial-and-error, etc. Third, the insight occurs, and the solution is illuminated. Finally, the verification of the solution to the problem is experienced. Since this model was proposed, other similar models have been explored that contain two or three similar stages.\n\nAn insight is the derivation of a rule which links cause with effect. The mind is a model of the universe built up from insights.\nThoughts of the mind fall into two categories: \nBULLET::::1.

Simulations of future scenarios using existing insights in the mind model in order to predict outcomes\nA mature mind has assimilated many insights and represents a sophisticated model of the universe. The mind-model might be inaccurate. When insight is not subordinate to a validation discipline like the 'scientific method', 'fallacious' thinking can result in a confused mind.\n\nIntuition, which is often described in the popular literature as an alternative thought process, is merely another manifestation of insight. In this process, multiple bits of seemingly unrelated data are linked together and a hypothesis or plan of action is generated. Usually this process is generated in a novel situation. Such a circumstance links data which had previously seemed unrelated. The categories and analytical process, however, are not distinct from any other form of insight.

The phenomena may include:\nBULLET::::- Impasse: An individual reaches a point where he or she simply appears to run out of ideas of new things to try that might solve a problem.\nBULLET::::- Fixation: An individual repeats the same type of solution attempt again and again, even when they see that it does not seem to lead to solution.\nBULLET::::- Incubation: A pause or gap between attempts to solve a problem can sometimes appear to aid the finding of a solution, as if one is clearing the mind of faulty ideas.\nBULLET::::- The 'Aha' experience: The solutions to some insight problems can seem to appear from nowhere, like a Eureka moment."], "wikipedia-38783360": ["In evolutionary biology, a key Innovation, also known as an adaptive breakthrough or key adaptation, is a novel phenotypic trait that allows subsequent radiation and success of a taxonomic group. Typically they bring new abilities that allows the taxa to rapidly diversify and invade niches that were not previously available. The phenomenon helps to explain how some taxa are much more diverse and have many more species than their sister taxa.\nThe term was first used in 1949 by Alden H. Miller who defined it as \"key adjustments in the morphological and physiological mechanism which are essential to the origin of new major groups\", although a broader, contemporary definition holds that \"a key innovation is an evolutionary change in individual traits that is causally linked to an increased diversification rate in the resulting clade\"."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-1466175": 2, "wikipedia-20497680": 2, "wikipedia-3358506": 2, "wikipedia-7755710": 1, "wikipedia-32456165": 1, "wikipedia-22461096": 1, "wikipedia-38783360": 1, "wikipedia-26457032": 1, "wikipedia-14148304": 1, "wikipedia-11459836": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-1466175": 3, "wikipedia-20497680": 3, "wikipedia-3358506": 3, "wikipedia-7755710": 1, "wikipedia-32456165": 1, "wikipedia-22461096": 1, "wikipedia-38783360": 2, "wikipedia-26457032": 1, "wikipedia-14148304": 1, "wikipedia-11459836": 1}}}

[No comparison group].\n\nSection::::The 7 Steps of EBP.:Search for and Collect Relevant Evidence.\nTo begin the search for evidence, use each keyword from the PICOT question that was formed. Once results have been found on the intervention or treatment, the research can be rated to determine which provides the strongest level of evidence. There are seven levels of evidence, with a level I being of the strongest quality and a level VII being of the weakest quality:\nBULLET::::- Level I: Evidence from systematic reviews or meta-analysis of randomized control trials\nBULLET::::- Level II: Evidence from well-designed randomized control trials\nBULLET::::- Level III: Evidence from well-designed control trials that are not randomized\nBULLET::::- Level IV: Evidence from case-control or cohort studies\nBULLET::::- Level V: Evidence from systematic reviews of descriptive or qualitative studies\nBULLET::::- Level VI: Evidence from a single descriptive or qualitative study\nBULLET::::- Level VII: Evidence from expert opinions\nThe strongest levels of evidence, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, summarize evidence related to a specific topic by finding and assessing studies that specifically relate to the question being asked. Meta-analyses are systematic reviews that also use quantitative measures such as statistics to summarize the results of the studies analyzed.\n\nSection::::The 7 Steps of EBP.:Critically Appraise the Evidence.\nTo begin the critical appraisal process, three questions need to asked to determine the relevance of evidence and if evidence applies to population being cared for. The three questions are: \nBULLET::::1. Are the results of the study valid?\nBULLET::::2. What are the results?\nBULLET::::3. Will the results be applicable in caring for patients?\nBULLET::::- Question 1 measures the validity. In order to be valid, the results of the study must be as close to the truth as possible. Also, the study must be conducted using best available research methods.\nBULLET::::- Question 2 measures the reliability of the study. If it is an intervention study, reliability consists of: whether the intervention worked, how large the effect was, and whether a clinician could repeat the study with similar results. If it is a qualitative study, reliability would be measured by determining if the research accomplished the purpose of the study.\nBULLET::::- Question 3 measures the applicability. The study may be used in practice when caring for patients if the subjects are similar to the patients being cared for, the benefit outweighs the harm, the study is feasible, and the patient desires the treatment.\nAfter asking these three questions, evidence appraisal continues by creating an evidence synthesis. This synthesis compares multiple studies to see if they are in agreement with each other.\n\nSection::::The 7 Steps of EBP.:Integrate the Evidence.\nAfter appraising the evidence, it is necessary to integrate it with the provider's expertise and patient's preferences. The patient is encouraged to practice autonomy and participate in the decision-making process. Therefore, even if the study had successful outcomes, the patient may refuse to receive a treatment. Assessment findings and patient history may reveal further contraindications to a certain evidence-based treatment. Lastly, availability of healthcare resources may limit the implementation of a treatment even if it is found to be effective in a study.\n\nSection::::The 7 Steps of EBP.:Evaluate Outcomes.\nThe next step in the evidence-based practice process is to evaluate whether the treatment was effective in terms of patient outcomes. It is important to evaluate the outcomes in a real-world clinical setting to determine the impact of the evidence-based change on healthcare quality.\n\nSection::::The 7 Steps of EBP.:Disseminate Outcomes.\nThe last step is to share the information especially if positive outcomes are achieved.

(3) Selective-combination insights involve taking selectively encoded and compared bits of relevant information and combining them in a novel way.

Some proposed potential mechanisms for insight include: suddenly seeing the problem in a new way, connecting the problem to another relevant problem/solution pair, releasing past experiences that are blocking the solution, or seeing problem in a larger, coherent context.\n\nResearch has shown sleep to help produce insight. Individuals were initially trained on insight problems. Following training, one group was tested on the insight problems after sleeping for eight hours at night, one group was tested after staying awake all night, and one group was tested after staying awake all day. Those that slept performed twice as well on the insight problems than those who stayed awake.\n\nRecently, insight was studied in a non-laboratory setting. Accounts of insight that have been reported in the media, such as in interviews, etc., were examined and coded. It was found that insights that occur in the field are typically reported to be associated with a sudden \"change in understanding\" and with \"seeing connections and contradictions\" in the problem. It was also found that insight in nature differed from insight in the laboratory. For example, insight in nature was often rather gradual, not sudden, and incubation was not as important. Other studies used online questionnaires to further explore insight outside of the laboratory, verifying the notion that insight often happens in situations such as in the shower, echoing the idea that creative ideas occur in situations where divergent thought is more likely, sometimes called the Three B's of Creativity, in Bed, on the Bus or in the Bath."], "wikipedia-1467948": ["The ability to understand what the goal of the problem is, and what rules could be applied, represents the key to solving the problem.

Some refer to this as the \"problem-solving cycle\". In this cycle one will recognize the problem, define the problem, develop a strategy to fix the problem, organize the knowledge of the problem cycle, figure out the resources at the user's disposal, monitor one's progress, and evaluate the solution for accuracy.

Insight is believed to occur with a break in mental fixation, allowing the solution to appear transparent and obvious.\nCurrently there are two theories for how people arrive at the solution for insight problems. The first is the progress monitoring theory. The person will analyze the distance from their current state to the goal state. Once a person realizes that they cannot solve the problem while on their current path, they will seek alternative solutions. In insight problems this usually occurs late in the puzzle. The second way that people attempt to solve these puzzles is the representational change theory. The problem solver initially has a low probability for success because they use inappropriate knowledge as they set unnecessary constraints on the problem. Once the person relaxes his or her constraints, they can bring previously unavailable knowledge into working memory to solve the problem. The person also utilizes chunk decomposition, where he or she will separate meaningful chunks into their component pieces. Both constraint relaxation and chunk decomposition allow for a change in representation, that is, a change in the distribution of activation across working memory, at which point they may exclaim, \"Aha!\" Currently both theories have support, with the progress monitoring theory being more suited to multiple step problems, and the representational change theory more suited to single step problems."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

According to Von Glasersfeld, sustaining motivation to learn is strongly dependent on the learner's confidence in his or her potential for learning. These feelings of competence and belief in potential to solve new problems, are derived from first-hand experience of mastery of problems in the past and are much more powerful than any external acknowledgment and motivation. This links up with Vygotsky's \"zone of proximal development\" where learners are challenged within close proximity to, yet slightly above, their current level of development. By experiencing the successful completion of challenging tasks, learners gain confidence and motivation to embark on more complex challenges.\n\nSocial constructivism, strongly influenced by Vygotsky's (1978) work, suggests that knowledge is first constructed in a social context and is then appropriated by individuals. According to social constructivists, the process of sharing individual perspectives \u2014 called \"collaborative elaboration\" \u2014 results in learners constructing understanding together that wouldn't be possible alone.\n\nSome social constructivist models also stress the need for collaboration among learners, in direct contradiction to traditional competitive approaches. One Vygotskian notion that has significant implications for peer collaboration, is that of the zone of proximal development. Defined as the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem-solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers, it differs from the fixed biological nature of Piaget's stages of development. Through a process of 'scaffolding' a learner can be extended beyond the limitations of physical maturation to the extent that the development process lags behind the learning process."], "wikipedia-8575327": ["Action learning is an approach to problem solving.

However, the explanation might lack depth on specific mechanisms (e.g., neuroplasticity) or tailored examples, which could require supplementary sources.", "wikipedia-40932775": ["Social problem-solving, in its most basic form, is defined as problem solving as it occurs in the natural environment. More specifically it refers to the cognitive-behavioral process in which one works to find adaptive ways of coping with everyday situations that are considered problematic. This process in self-directed, conscious, effortful, cogent, and focused. Adaptive social problem-solving skills are known to be effective coping skills in an array of stressful situations. Social problem-solving consists of two major processes. One of these processes is known as problem orientation. Problem orientation is defined as the schemas one holds about problems in everyday life and ones assessment of their ability to solve said problems.\nThe problem orientation may be positive and constructive to the problem solving process or negative and therefore dysfunctional in the process. Problem-solving proper is known as the second major process in social problem-solving. This process refers to the skills and techniques one uses to search for solutions and applying these skills to find the best solutions available. This model has been expanded by McFall and Liberman and colleagues. In these variations social problem-solving is considered to be a multi-step process including the adoption of a general orientation, defining the problem, brainstorming for solutions, decision making, and follow up stages.\nSection::::Process.\nBased on the above model, it is hypothesized that a positive problem orientation leads to rational problem-solving skills. A rational problem-solving style is defined as a sensible, thoughtful, and methodical application of effective problem-solving skills. This, in turn, is most likely to result in positive outcomes and an exit from the problem solving process for this particular instance. When a negative outcome occurs, a person with rational problem solving skills is more likely to begin the cycle of problem-solving again. This time with the intent of finding a more appropriate solution or to redefine the problem. On the other hand, a negative problem solving orientation is likely to lead towards impulsive-careless or avoidant problem-solving styles. An impulsive-careless style is defined as narrowed, rash, thoughtless, speedy, and incomplete attempts at problem solving. An avoidance style to problem-solving is characterized by inaction, procrastination, and attempts to shift responsibility to others. Both of these styles are hypothesized to lead towards negative outcomes more often in the Social Problem-Solving Process. When negative outcomes occur, a person with an impulsive-careless or avoidant skill set is more likely to give up.\nSection::::Benefits and deficits.\nSocial problem-solving involves various abilities and skills which lead to adaptive outcomes for several different populations. In general, effective problem-solving skills can have several benefits. These skills can increase situational coping and reduce emotional distress. Research has shown that one\u2019s problem orientation is specifically related to levels of psychological stress and adjustment. Of course, the opposite generally leads to negative outcomes. A lack of social problem-solving skills and a negative problem orientation can lead to depression and suicidality in children and adults, self-injurious behaviors, and increased worrying.

Inpatients with Schizophrenia have also been observed to have deficits in social problem-solving skills."], "wikipedia-38984798": ["Collaborative group work has the ability to promote critical thinking skills, problem solving skills, social skills, and self-esteem. By using collaboration and communication, members often learn from one another and construct meaningful knowledge that often leads to better learning outcomes than individual work."], "wikipedia-1040161": ["Constructivism in education is an epistemological perspective of learning focused on how students actively create (or \u201cconstruct\u201d) knowledge out of their experiences. Emphasis is placed on agency and prior \"knowing\" and experience of the learner, which is often determined by their social and cultural contexts environment. While Behaviorist models of learning may help understand what students are doing, educators also need to know what students are thinking, and how to enrich what students are thinking.\n\nPiaget focused on how humans make meaning in relation to the interaction between their experiences and their ideas. His views tended to focus on human development in relation to what is occurring with an individual as distinct from development influenced by other persons. Vygotsky emphasized the importance of sociocultural learning; how interactions with adults, more capable peers, and cognitive tools are internalized by learners to form mental constructs through the zone of proximal development.\n\nExpanding upon Vygotsky's theory Jerome Bruner and other educational psychologists developed the important concept of instructional scaffolding, whereby the social or informational environment offers supports (or scaffolds) for learning that are gradually withdrawn as they become internalized.\n\nWhen individuals \"assimilate\" new information, they incorporate it into an already existing framework without changing that framework. This may occur when individuals' experiences are aligned with their internal representations of the world, but may also occur as a failure to change a faulty understanding; for example, they may not notice events, may misunderstand input from others, or may decide that an event is a fluke and is therefore unimportant as information about the world. In contrast, when individuals' experiences contradict their internal representations, they may change their perceptions of the experiences to fit their internal representations.\n\nAccording to the theory, \"accommodation\" is the process of reframing one's mental representation of the external world to fit new experiences. Accommodation can be understood as the mechanism by which failure leads to learning: when we act on the expectation that the world operates in one way and it violates our expectations, we often fail, but by accommodating this new experience and reframing our model of the way the world works, we learn from the experience of failure, or others' failure.\n\nIt is important to note that constructivism is not a particular pedagogy. In fact, constructivism is a theory describing how learning happens, regardless of whether learners are using their experiences to understand a lecture or following the instructions for building a model airplane. In both cases, the theory of constructivism suggests that learners construct knowledge out of their experiences.\n\nHowever, constructivism is often associated with pedagogic approaches that promote active learning, or learning by doing. There are many critics of \"learning by doing\" (a.k.a. \"discovery learning\") as an instructional strategy (e.g. see the criticisms below). While there is much enthusiasm for constructivism as a design strategy, according to Tobias and Duffy \"... to us it would appear that constructivism remains more of a philosophical framework than a theory that either allows us to precisely describe instruction or prescribe design strategies.\"\n\nSocial constructivism not only acknowledges the uniqueness and complexity of the learner, but actually encourages, utilizes and rewards it as an integral part of the learning process.\n\nSocial constructivisms or socioculturalism encourage the learner or learners to arrive at his or her version of the truth, influenced by his or her background, culture or embedded worldview. Historical developments and symbol systems, such as language, logic, and mathematical systems, are inherited by the learner as a member of a particular culture and these are learned throughout the learner's life. This also stresses the importance of the nature of the learner's social interaction with knowledgeable members of the society. Without the social interaction with other more knowledgeable people, it is impossible to acquire social meaning of important symbol systems and learn how to utilize them. Young children develop their thinking abilities by interacting with other children, adults and the physical world. From the social constructivist viewpoint, it is thus important to take into account the background and culture of the learner throughout the learning process, as this background also helps to shape the knowledge and truth that the learner creates, discovers and attains in the learning process.\n\nFurthermore, it is argued that the responsibility of learning should reside increasingly with the learner. Social constructivism thus emphasizes the importance of the learner being actively involved in the learning process, unlike previous educational viewpoints where the responsibility rested with the instructor to teach and where the learner played a passive, receptive role. Von Glasersfeld (1989) emphasized that learners construct their own understanding and that they do not simply mirror and reflect what they read. Learners look for meaning and will try to find regularity and order in the events of the world even in the absence of full or complete information."], "wikipedia-8575327": ["Action learning is an approach to problem solving. It involves taking action and reflecting upon the results. This helps improve the problem-solving process as well as simplify the solutions developed by the team.\n\nThe action learning process includes:\nBULLET::::1. a real problem that is important, critical, and usually complex,\nBULLET::::2. a diverse problem-solving team or \"set\",\nBULLET::::3. a process that promotes curiosity, inquiry, and reflection,\nBULLET::::4. a requirement that talk be converted into action and, ultimately, a solution, and\nBULLET::::5. a commitment to learning.\n\nIn most forms of action learning, a coach is included and is responsible for promoting and facilitating learning, as well as encouraging the team to be self-managing.\n\nSince action learning has proven to be very effective in developing a number of individual leadership and team problem-solving skills, it has become a component in corporate and organizational leadership development programs. This strategy is different from the \"one size fits all\" curriculum that is characteristic of many training and development programs.\n\nPeople had to be aware of their lack of relevant knowledge and be prepared to explore the area of their ignorance with suitable questions and help from other people in similar positions.\n\nIn Revans' book there are examples from the United States, Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific.\n\nInternational Management Centres, the action learning professional association where Revans was inaugural president, have proposed extension to this formula with the addition of \"R\" for \"reflection\". This has also been proposed by Michael Marquardt:\nL = P + Q + R .\nIn this expanded equation, \"R\" refers to reflection. This additional element emphasizes the point that \"great questions\" should evoke thoughtful reflections while considering the current problem, the desired goal, designing strategies, developing action or implementation plans, or executing action steps that are components of the implementation plan.\n\nThe proven power of the action learning process originates in its theoretical underpinnings (Waddill & Marquardt, 2003). Waddill and Marquardt demonstrate the link between adult learning theory and Marquardt's action learning approach in their article entitled \"Adult Learning Orientations and Action Learning\".\n\nOne of the keys to effective Action learning is asking the 'right question'. When asked to the right people at the right time, these questions result in obtaining the necessary information. The Action Learning process, which primarily uses a questioning approach, can be more helpful than offering advice because it assumes that each person has the capacity to find their own answers.\n\nNormally, the purpose of asking a question is to obtain information. However, in Action Learning, the purpose is to help someone else to do one or more of the following:\nBULLET::::- Think more deeply\nBULLET::::- Explore new options and perspectives\nBULLET::::- Reflect in order to make better choices and decisions"], "wikipedia-24470328": ["Researchers agree that play provides a strong foundation for intellectual growth, creativity, problem-solving and basic academic knowledge.

When children play, they are learning new words, how to problem solve, and how to be flexible\u201d.

In particular, he held that when a proper name occurs in the context of an attitude report, its reference shifts to its ordinary sense: thus 'Phosphorus', for example, denotes the planet Venus when it occurs in the sentence 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' or in an identity sentence like (4), but when it occurs embedded in an attitude report like (5) it denotes its ordinary \"sense.\""], "wikipedia-1063385": ["In the radio series and the first novel, a group of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings demand to learn the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything from the supercomputer Deep Thought, specially built for this purpose.

But this should be impossible if we are faithful to a few simple and reasonable assumptions that are commonly accepted among philosophers: direct reference, semantic compositionality and \"semantic innocence\". Direct reference is the principle that singular terms contribute their referents to the propositions expressed by the sentences which contain them. Compositionality is the ideas that the meaning of a composite expression is derived from the parts which make it up. Semantic innocence is the principle that \"embedding\" a term or name in a \"that\" clause should not change its semantic value.\n\nGiven these basic assumptions how is it possible that the truth value of a sentence in the context of an attribution can change - that is, how is semantic opacity possible?"], "wikipedia-23674": ["An example Wittgenstein uses is the \"duckrabbit\", an ambiguous image that can be \"seen as\" either a duck or a rabbit.

But what occurs when one sees it first as a duck, then as a rabbit? As the gnomic remarks in the \"Investigations\" indicate, Wittgenstein isn't sure.

However we could put a circle for \"x\" in those boxes, in which case each would denote a function of one argument, \"x\", which returns the same value independently of \"x\", called a constant function. As far as their outputs are concerned, constants and constant functions are indistinguishable; the difference is that a constant takes no arguments, called a \"zeroary\" or \"nullary\" operation, while a constant function takes one argument, which it ignores, and is a \"unary\" operation.\nVenn diagrams are helpful in visualizing laws. The commutativity laws for \u2227 and \u2228 can be seen from the symmetry of the diagrams: a binary operation that was not commutative would not have a symmetric diagram because interchanging \"x\" and \"y\" would have the effect of reflecting the diagram horizontally and any failure of commutativity would then appear as a failure of symmetry.\nIdempotence of \u2227 and \u2228 can be visualized by sliding the two circles together and noting that the shaded area then becomes the whole circle, for both \u2227 and \u2228."]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

With these axes, geometric frustration arises if there is a ferromagnetic interaction between neighbours, where energy is minimized by parallel spins. The best possible arrangement is shown in Figure 4, with two spins pointing towards the centre and two pointing away. The net magnetic moment points upwards, maximising ferromagnetic interactions in this direction, but left and right vectors cancel out (i.e. are antiferromagnetically aligned), as do forwards and backwards.

This method for approximating was used for centuries, obtaining more accuracy by using polygons of larger and larger number of sides.

A more specialized source may be needed for complete detail.", "wikipedia-40679472": ["Performing a probabilistic risk assessment starts with a set of initiating events that change the state or configuration of the system. An initiating event is an event that starts a reaction, such as the way a spark (initiating event) can start a fire that could lead to other events (intermediate events) such as a tree burning down, and then finally an outcome, for example, the burnt tree no longer provides apples for food. Each initiating event leads to another event and continuing through this path, where each intermediate event's probability of occurrence may be calculated by using fault tree analysis, until an end state is reached (the outcome of a tree no longer providing apples for food). Intermediate events are commonly split into a binary (success/failure or yes/no) but may be split into more than two as long as the events are mutually exclusive, meaning that they can not occur at the same time. If a spark is the initiating event there is a probability that the spark will start a fire or will not start a fire (binary yes or no) as well as the probability that the fire spreads to a tree or does not spread to a tree. End states are classified into groups that can be successes or severity of consequences. An example of a success would be that no fire started and the tree still provided apples for food while the severity of consequence would be that a fire did start and we lose apples as a source of food.\n\nThe overall goal of event tree analysis is to determine the probability of possible negative outcomes that can cause harm and result from the chosen initiating event. It is necessary to use detailed information about a system to understand intermediate events, accident scenarios, and initiating events to construct the event tree diagram. The event tree begins with the initiating event where consequences of this event follow in a binary (success/failure) manner. Each event creates a path in which a series of successes or failures will occur where the overall probability of occurrence for that path can be calculated. The probabilities of failures for intermediate events can be calculated using fault tree analysis and the probability of success can be calculated from 1 = probability of success (ps) + probability of failure (pf). For example, in the equation 1 = (ps) + (pf) if we know that pf=.1 from fault tree analysis then through simple algebra we can solve for ps where ps = (1) - (pf) then we would have ps = (1) - (.1) and ps=.9.\n\nSteps to perform an event tree analysis:\nBULLET::::1. Define the system: Define what needs to be involved or where to draw the boundaries.\nBULLET::::2. Identify the accident scenarios: Perform a system assessment to find hazards or accident scenarios within the system design.\nBULLET::::3. Identify the initiating events: Use a hazard analysis to define initiating events.\nBULLET::::4. Identify intermediate events: Identify countermeasures associated with the specific scenario.\nBULLET::::5. Build the event tree diagram\nBULLET::::6. Obtain event failure probabilities: If the failure probability can not be obtained use fault tree analysis to calculate it.\nBULLET::::7. Identify the outcome risk: Calculate the overall probability of the event paths and determine the risk.\nBULLET::::8. Evaluate the outcome risk: Evaluate the risk of each path and determine its acceptability.\nBULLET::::9. Recommend corrective action: If the outcome risk of a path is not acceptable develop design changes that change the risk.\nBULLET::::10. Document the ETA: Document the entire process on the event tree diagrams and update for new information as needed.\n\n1 = (probability of success) + (probability of failure)\nThe probability of success can be derived from the probability of failure.\nOverall path probability = (probability of event 1) X (probability of event 2) X (probability of event n...)"]}}, "DeepSeek-V3-0324": {"wikipedia": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Spatial abilities are also important for success in fields such as sports, technical aptitude, mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, economic forecasting, meteorology, chemistry and physics. Not only do spatial abilities involve understanding the outside world, but they also involve processing outside information and reasoning with it through representation in the mind.\nSection::::Definition and types.\nSpatial ability is the capacity to understand, reason and remember the spatial relations among objects or space. There are four common types of spatial abilities which include spatial or visuo-spatial perception, spatial visualization, mental folding and mental rotation. Each of these abilities have unique properties and importance to many types of tasks whether in certain jobs or everyday life. For example, spatial perception is defined as the ability to perceive spatial relationships in respect to the orientation of one's body despite distracting information. Mental rotation on the other hand is the mental ability to manipulate and rotate 2D or 3D objects in space quickly and accurately. Lastly, spatial visualization is characterized as complicated multi-step manipulations of spatially presented information. These three abilities are mediated and supported by a fourth spatial cognitive factor known as spatial working memory. Spatial working memory is the ability to temporarily store a certain amount of visual-spatial memories under attentional control in order to complete a task. This cognitive ability mediates individual differences in the capacity for higher level spatial abilities such as mental rotation."], "wikipedia-3190431": ["Spatial analysis\nComplex issues arise in spatial analysis, many of which are neither clearly defined nor completely resolved, but form the basis for current research. The most fundamental of these is the problem of defining the spatial location of the entities being studied.\nClassification of the techniques of spatial analysis is difficult because of the large number of different fields of research involved, the different fundamental approaches which can be chosen, and the many forms the data can take.\nSection::::Fundamental issues in spatial analysis.:Spatial dependency or auto-correlation.\nSpatial dependency is the co-variation of properties within geographic space: characteristics at proximal locations appear to be correlated, either positively or negatively. Spatial dependency leads to the spatial autocorrelation problem in statistics since, like temporal autocorrelation, this violates standard statistical techniques that assume independence among observations. For example, regression analyses that do not compensate for spatial dependency can have unstable parameter estimates and yield unreliable significance tests. Spatial regression models (see below) capture these relationships and do not suffer from these weaknesses. It is also appropriate to view spatial dependency as a source of information rather than something to be corrected.\nLocational effects also manifest as spatial heterogeneity, or the apparent variation in a process with respect to location in geographic space. Unless a space is uniform and boundless, every location will have some degree of uniqueness relative to the other locations. This affects the spatial dependency relations and therefore the spatial process. Spatial heterogeneity means that overall parameters estimated for the entire system may not adequately describe the process at any given location.\nSection::::Fundamental issues in spatial analysis.:Scaling.\nSpatial measurement scale is a persistent issue in spatial analysis; more detail is available at the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) topic entry. Landscape ecologists developed a series of scale invariant metrics for aspects of ecology that are fractal in nature. In more general terms, no scale independent method of analysis is widely agreed upon for spatial statistics.\nSection::::Fundamental issues in spatial analysis.:Sampling.\nSpatial sampling involves determining a limited number of locations in geographic space for faithfully measuring phenomena that are subject to dependency and heterogeneity. Dependency suggests that since one location can predict the value of another location, we do not need observations in both places. But heterogeneity suggests that this relation can change across space, and therefore we cannot trust an observed degree of dependency beyond a region that may be small. Basic spatial sampling schemes include random, clustered and systematic. These basic schemes can be applied at multiple levels in a designated spatial hierarchy (e.g., urban area, city, neighborhood). It is also possible to exploit ancillary data, for example, using property values as a guide in a spatial sampling scheme to measure educational attainment and income. Spatial models such as autocorrelation statistics, regression and interpolation (see below) can also dictate sample design."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-21105635": 1, "wikipedia-49045837": 1, "wikipedia-347543": 1, "wikipedia-1901158": 1, "wikipedia-34087749": 1, "wikipedia-2617652": 1, "wikipedia-3190431": 1, "wikipedia-57127860": 1, "wikipedia-27262352": 1, "wikipedia-17994": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-21105635": 1, "wikipedia-49045837": 2, "wikipedia-347543": 1, "wikipedia-1901158": 1, "wikipedia-34087749": 1, "wikipedia-2617652": 1, "wikipedia-3190431": 2, "wikipedia-57127860": 1, "wikipedia-27262352": 1, "wikipedia-17994": 1}}}

(cf. Bertrand's paradox).\nBULLET::::- What is the chance that three random points in the plane form an acute (rather than obtuse) triangle?\nBULLET::::- What is the mean area of the polygonal regions formed when randomly oriented lines are spread over the plane?\nFor mathematical development see the concise monograph by Solomon.\nSince the late 20th century the topic has split into two topics with different emphases. Integral geometry sprang from the principle that the mathematically natural probability models are those that are invariant under certain transformation groups. This topic emphasises systematic development of formulas for calculating expected values associated with the geometric \nobjects derived from random points, and can in part be viewed as a sophisticated branch of multivariate calculus. Stochastic geometry emphasises the random geometrical objects themselves. For instance: different models for random lines or for random tessellations of the plane; random sets formed by making points of a spatial Poisson process be (say) centers of discs."], "wikipedia-43932548": ["Random projection is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a set of points which lie in Euclidean space. Random projection methods are known for their power, simplicity, and low error rates when compared to other methods. According to experimental results, random projection preserves distances well, but empirical results are sparse.\n\nThe core idea behind random projection is given in the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, which states that if points in a vector space are of sufficiently high dimension, then they may be projected into a suitable lower-dimensional space in a way which approximately preserves the distances between the points.\n\nRandom projection is a simple and computationally efficient way to reduce the dimensionality of data by trading a controlled amount of error for faster processing times and smaller model sizes. The dimensions and distribution of random projection matrices are controlled so as to approximately preserve the pairwise distances between any two samples of the dataset.\n\nQuasiorthogonality of large random sets is important for methods of random approximation in machine learning. In high dimensions, exponentially large numbers of randomly and independently chosen vectors from equidistribution on a sphere (and from many other distributions) are almost orthogonal with probability close to one. This implies that in order to represent an element of such a high-dimensional space by linear combinations of randomly and independently chosen vectors, it may often be necessary to generate samples of exponentially large length if we use bounded coefficients in linear combinations. On the other hand, if coefficients with arbitrarily large values are allowed, the number of randomly generated elements that are sufficient for approximation is even less than dimension of the data space."], "wikipedia-474939": ["In computer science, geometric hashing is originally a method for efficiently finding two-dimensional objects represented by discrete points that have undergone an affine transformation (example below is based on similarity transformation), though extensions exist to some other object representations and transformations. In an off-line step, the objects are encoded by treating each pair of points as a geometric basis. The remaining points can be represented in an invariant fashion with respect to this basis using two parameters. For each point, its quantized transformed coordinates are stored in the hash table as a key, and indices of the basis points as a value. Then a new pair of basis points is selected, and the process is repeated. In the on-line (recognition) step, randomly selected pairs of data points are considered as candidate bases. For each candidate basis, the remaining data points are encoded according to the basis and possible correspondences from the object are found in the previously constructed table. The candidate basis is accepted if a sufficiently large number of the data points index a consistent object basis.\nGeometric hashing was originally suggested in computer vision for object recognition in 2D and 3D, but later was applied to different problems such as structural alignment of proteins."], "wikipedia-34676009": ["LP-type problem\nIn the study of algorithms, an LP-type problem (also called a generalized linear program) is an optimization problem that shares certain properties with low-dimensional linear programs and that may be solved by similar algorithms.

They may be solved by a combination of randomized algorithms in an amount of time that is linear in the number of elements defining the problem, and subexponential in the dimension of the problem.\n\nMany natural optimization problems in computational geometry are LP-type:\nBULLET::::- The smallest circle problem is the problem of finding the minimum radius of a circle containing a given set of points in the plane. It satisfies monotonicity (adding more points can only make the circle larger) and locality (if the smallest circle for set contains and , then the same circle also contains }). Because the smallest circle is always determined by some three points, the smallest circle problem has combinatorial dimension three, even though it is defined using two-dimensional Euclidean geometry. More generally, the smallest enclosing ball of points in dimensions forms an LP-type problem of combinatorial dimension . The smallest circle problem can be generalized to the smallest ball enclosing a set of balls, to the smallest ball that touches or surrounds each of a set of balls, to the weighted 1-center problem, or to similar smaller enclosing ball problems in non-Euclidean spaces such as the space with distances defined by Bregman divergence.

In this formulation, the set is the set of all vertices in both polytopes, and the function value is the negation of the smallest distance between the convex hulls of the two subsets of vertices in the two polytopes. The combinatorial dimension of the problem is if the two polytopes are disjoint, or if they have a nonempty intersection.\nBULLET::::- Let } be a set of quasiconvex functions.

The aim of the study in this field is to determine at what stage a particular property of the graph is likely to arise. Different random graph models produce different probability distributions on graphs. Most commonly studied is the one proposed by Edgar Gilbert, denoted \"G\"(\"n\",\"p\"), in which every possible edge occurs independently with probability 0 < \"p\" < 1. The probability of obtaining \"any one particular\" random graph with \"m\" edges is formula_1 with the notation formula_2. \n\nThe theory of random graphs studies typical properties of random graphs, those that hold with high probability for graphs drawn from a particular distribution. For example, we might ask for a given value of formula_11 and formula_12 what the probability is that formula_13 is connected. In studying such questions, researchers often concentrate on the asymptotic behavior of random graphs\u2014the values that various probabilities converge to as formula_11 grows very large."], "wikipedia-43932548": ["Random projection is a simple and computationally efficient way to reduce the dimensionality of data by trading a controlled amount of error for faster processing times and smaller model sizes.

For example, consider a sorting algorithm like quicksort, which has small expected running time when the input items are presented in random order, but is very slow when they are presented in certain unfavorable orders. A randomizing function from the integers 1 to \"n\" to the integers 1 to \"n\" can be used to rearrange the \"n\" input items in \"random\" order, before calling that algorithm. This modified (randomized) algorithm will have small expected running time, whatever the input order.\nIn theory, randomization functions are assumed to be truly random, and yield an unpredictably different function every time the algorithm is executed. The randomization technique would not work if, at every execution of the algorithm, the randomization function always performed the same mapping, or a mapping entirely determined by some externally observable parameter (such as the program's startup time). With such a \"pseudo-randomization\" function, one could in principle construct a sequence of calls such that the function would always yield a \"bad\" case for the underlying deterministic algorithm. For that sequence of calls, the average cost would be closer to the worst-case cost, rather than the average cost for random inputs.\nIn practice, however, the main concern is that some \"bad\" cases for the deterministic algorithm may occur in practice much more often than it would be predicted by chance. For example, in a naive variant of quicksort, the worst case is when the input items are already sorted \u2014 which is a very common occurrence in many applications. For such algorithms, even a fixed pseudo-random permutation may be good enough. Even though the resulting \"pseudo-randomized\" algorithm would still have as many \"bad\" cases as the original, they will be certain peculiar orders that would be quite unlikely to arise in real applications. So, in practice one often uses randomization functions that are derived from pseudo-random number generators, preferably seeded with external \"random\" data such as the program's startup time.\nThe uniformity requirements for a randomizing function are usually much weaker than those of hash functions and pseudo-random generators. The minimum requirement is that it maps any input of the deterministic algorithm into a \"good\" input with a sufficiently high probability.

Solutions to these problems are usually situation- or context-specific. The process starts with problem finding and problem shaping, where the problem is discovered and simplified.

Problem solving has two major domains: mathematical problem solving and personal problem solving. Both are seen in terms of some difficulty or barrier that is encountered. Empirical research shows many different strategies and factors influence everyday problem solving. Section::::Problem-solving strategies. Problem-solving strategies are the steps that one would use to find the problems that are in the way to getting to one's own goal. Some refer to this as the \"problem-solving cycle\". In this cycle one will recognize the problem, define the problem, develop a strategy to fix the problem, organize the knowledge of the problem cycle, figure out the resources at the user's disposal, monitor one's progress, and evaluate the solution for accuracy. The reason it is called a cycle is that once one is completed with a problem another will usually pop up. The following techniques are usually called \"problem-solving strategies\" BULLET::::- Abstraction: solving the problem in a model of the system before applying it to the real system BULLET::::- Analogy: using a solution that solves an analogous problem BULLET::::- Brainstorming: (especially among groups of people) suggesting a large number of solutions or ideas and combining and developing them until an optimum solution is found BULLET::::- Divide and conquer: breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable problems BULLET::::- Hypothesis testing: assuming a possible explanation to the problem and trying to prove (or, in some contexts, disprove) the assumption BULLET::::- Lateral thinking: approaching solutions indirectly and creatively BULLET::::- Means-ends analysis: choosing an action at each step to move closer to the goal BULLET::::- Reduction: transforming the problem into another problem for which solutions exist BULLET::::- Research: employing existing ideas or adapting existing solutions to similar problems BULLET::::- Root cause analysis: identifying the cause of a problem BULLET::::- Trial-and-error: testing possible solutions until the right one is found"], "wikipedia-320319": ["If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it.
