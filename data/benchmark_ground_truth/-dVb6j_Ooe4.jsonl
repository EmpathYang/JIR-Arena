For example, the class NP is the set of decision problems whose solutions can be determined by a non-deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time, while the class PSPACE is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial space.\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds. The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the mathematical logic needed to express them; see descriptive complexity.\n\nThe most commonly used problems are decision problems. However, complexity classes can be defined based on function problems (an example is FP), counting problems (e.g. #P), optimization problems, promise problems, etc.\n\nThe most common model of computation is the deterministic Turing machine, but many complexity classes are based on nondeterministic Turing machines, boolean circuits, quantum Turing machines, monotone circuits, etc.\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function \"f\"(\"n\") often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {\"xx\" | \"x\" is any binary string} can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" . This forms the basis for the complexity class P, which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is FP.\nThe Blum axioms can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete computational model.\n\nALL is the class of all decision problems. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\nOther important complexity classes include BPP, ZPP and RP, which are defined using probabilistic Turing machines.\n\nThe classes AC and NC are defined using Boolean circuits.\n\nThe classes BQP and QMA, which are of key importance in quantum information science, are defined using quantum Turing machines.\n\n#P is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\nClasses like IP and AM are defined using Interactive proof systems.\n\nSeveral output-sensitive classes have been defined for enumeration algorithms.\n\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem \"X\" can be solved using an algorithm for \"Y\", \"X\" is no more difficult than \"Y\", and we say that \"X\" \"reduces\" to \"Y\". There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions.\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem \"X\" is \"hard\" for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to \"X\". Thus no problem in C is harder than \"X\", since an algorithm for \"X\" allows us to solve any problem in C. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems.\nIf a problem \"X\" is in C and is hard for C, then \"X\" is said to be \"complete\" for C. This means that \"X\" is the hardest problem in C (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that \"X\" is one of the hardest problems in C). Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P\u00a0=\u00a0NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, \u03a0, to another problem, \u03a0, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0. This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0 would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P\u00a0=\u00a0NP."], "wikipedia-24092190": ["A complexity class is a collection of problems which can be solved by some computational model under resource constraints.

It was one of the first modern treatises to advance the theory of marginal utility.\n\nMenger advanced his theory that the marginal utility of goods, rather than labor inputs, is the source of their value. This marginalist theory solved the diamond-water paradox that had been puzzling classical economists: the fact that mankind finds diamonds to be far more valuable than water although water is far more important.\n\nMenger stressed uncertainty in the making of economic decisions, rather than relying on \"homo economicus\" or the rational man who was fully informed of all circumstances impinging on his decisions. This was a deviation from classical and neoclassical economic thought. Menger asserted that such perfect knowledge never exists, and that therefore all economic activity implies risk. The entrepreneurs' role was to collect and evaluate information and to act on those risks.\n\nMenger saw that time was the root of uncertainty within economics. As production takes time then producers have no certainty on the supply or demand for their product. Thus the price of the finished product bears no resemblance to the costs of production, since the two represent market conditions at very different points in time.\n\nMarginal utility as the source of value meant that the perceived need for an object was seen to be dictating the value, on an individual rather than a general level. The implication was that the individual mind is the source of economic value.\n\nAlthough Menger accepted the marginal utility theory, he made deviations from the work of other neoclassical pioneers.

As for time analysis above, analyze the algorithm, typically using space complexity analysis to get an estimate of the run-time memory needed as a function as the size of the input data. The result is normally expressed using Big O notation.\nThere are up to four aspects of memory usage to consider:\nBULLET::::- The amount of memory needed to hold the code for the algorithm.\nBULLET::::- The amount of memory needed for the input data.\nBULLET::::- The amount of memory needed for any output data.\nBULLET::::- Some algorithms, such as sorting, often rearrange the input data and don't need any additional space for output data. This property is referred to as \"in-place\" operation.\nBULLET::::- The amount of memory needed as working space during the calculation.\nBULLET::::- This includes local variables and any stack space needed by routines called during a calculation; this stack space can be significant for algorithms which use recursive techniques.\nSection::::Measures of resource usage.:Space.:Caching and memory hierarchy.\nCurrent computers can have relatively large amounts of memory (possibly Gigabytes), so having to squeeze an algorithm into a confined amount of memory is much less of a problem than it used to be. But the presence of four different categories of memory can be significant:\nBULLET::::- Processor registers, the fastest of computer memory technologies with the least amount of storage space. Most direct computation on modern computers occurs with source and destination operands in registers before being updated to the cache, main memory and virtual memory if needed. On a processor core, there are typically on the order of hundreds of bytes or fewer of register availability, although a register file may contain more physical registers than architectural registers defined in the instruction set architecture.\nBULLET::::- Cache memory is the second fastest and second smallest memory available in the memory hierarchy. Caches are present in CPUs, GPUs, hard disk drives and external peripherals, and are typically implemented in static RAM. Memory caches are multi-leveled; lower levels are larger, slower and typically shared between processor cores in multi-core processors. In order to process operands in cache memory, a processing unit must fetch the data from the cache, perform the operation in registers and write the data back to the cache. This operates at speeds comparable (about 2-10 times slower) with the CPU or GPU's arithmetic logic unit or floating-point unit if in the L1 cache. It is about 10 times slower if there is an L1 cache miss and it must be retrieved from and written to the L2 cache, and a further 10 times slower if there is an L2 cache miss and it must be retrieved from an L3 cache, if present.\nBULLET::::- Main physical memory is most often implemented in dynamic RAM (DRAM). The main memory is much larger (typically gigabytes compared to \u22488 megabytes) than an L3 CPU cache, with read and write latencies typically 10-100 times slower. , RAM is increasingly implemented on-chip of processors, as CPU or GPU memory.\nBULLET::::- Virtual memory is most often implemented in terms of secondary storage such as a hard disk, and is an extension to the memory hierarchy that has much larger storage space but much larger latency, typically around 1000 times slower than a cache miss for a value in RAM. While originally motivated to create the impression of higher amounts of memory being available than were truly available, virtual memory is more important in contemporary usage for its time-space tradeoff and enabling the usage of virtual machines. Cache misses from main memory are called page faults, and incur huge performance penalties on programs.\nAn algorithm whose memory needs will fit in cache memory will be much faster than an algorithm which fits in main memory, which in turn will be very much faster than an algorithm which has to resort to virtual memory. Because of this, cache replacement policies are extremely important to high-performance computing, as are cache-aware programming and data alignment. To further complicate the issue, some systems have up to three levels of cache memory, with varying effective speeds. Different systems will have different amounts of these various types of memory, so the effect of algorithm memory needs can vary greatly from one system to another.\nIn the early days of electronic computing, if an algorithm and its data wouldn't fit in main memory then the algorithm couldn't be used. Nowadays the use of virtual memory appears to provide lots of memory, but at the cost of performance. If an algorithm and its data will fit in cache memory, then very high speed can be obtained; in this case minimizing space will also help minimize time. This is called the principle of locality, and can be subdivided into locality of reference, spatial locality and temporal locality. An algorithm which will not fit completely in cache memory but which exhibits locality of reference may perform reasonably well."], "wikipedia-125297": ["In the bottom-up approach, we calculate the smaller values of codice_8 first, then build larger values from them.

However, different resources such as time and space complexity cannot be compared directly, so which of two algorithms is considered to be more efficient often depends on which measure of efficiency is considered most important.\n\nFor example, bubble sort and timsort are both algorithms to sort a list of items from smallest to largest. Bubble sort sorts the list in time proportional to the number of elements squared (formula_1, see Big O notation), but only requires a small amount of extra memory which is constant with respect to the length of the list (formula_2). Timsort sorts the list in time linearithmic (proportional to a quantity times its logarithm) in the list's length (formula_3), but has a space requirement linear in the length of the list (formula_4). If large lists must be sorted at high speed for a given application, timsort is a better choice; however, if minimizing the memory footprint of the sorting is more important, bubble sort is a better choice.\n\nEarly electronic computers were severely limited both by the speed of operations and the amount of memory available. In some cases it was realized that there was a space\u2013time trade-off, whereby a task could be handled either by using a fast algorithm which used quite a lot of working memory, or by using a slower algorithm which used very little working memory. The engineering trade-off was then to use the fastest algorithm which would fit in the available memory.\n\nModern computers are significantly faster than the early computers, and have a much larger amount of memory available (Gigabytes instead of Kilobytes). Nevertheless, Donald Knuth emphasised that efficiency is still an important consideration:\n\nMeasures are normally expressed as a function of the size of the input formula_12.\nThe two most common measures are:\nBULLET::::- \"Time\": how long does the algorithm take to complete?\nBULLET::::- \"Space\": how much working memory (typically RAM) is needed by the algorithm? This has two aspects: the amount of memory needed by the code (auxiliary space usage), and the amount of memory needed for the data on which the code operates (intrinsic space usage).\nFor computers whose power is supplied by a battery (e.g. laptops and smartphones), or for very long/large calculations (e."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The main idea is to assign to each vertex the color that differs from the color of its parent in the depth-first search forest, assigning colors in a preorder traversal of the depth-first-search forest. This will necessarily provide a two-coloring of the spanning forest consisting of the edges connecting vertices to their parents, but it may not properly color some of the non-forest edges. In a depth-first search forest, one of the two endpoints of every non-forest edge is an ancestor of the other endpoint, and when the depth first search discovers an edge of this type it should check that these two vertices have different colors. If they do not, then the path in the forest from ancestor to descendant, together with the miscolored edge, form an odd cycle, which is returned from the algorithm together with the result that the graph is not bipartite. However, if the algorithm terminates without detecting an odd cycle of this type, then every edge must be properly colored, and the algorithm returns the coloring together with the result that the graph is bipartite.\nAlternatively, a similar procedure may be used with breadth-first search in place of depth-first search. Again, each node is given the opposite color to its parent in the search forest, in breadth-first order. If, when a vertex is colored, there exists an edge connecting it to a previously-colored vertex with the same color, then this edge together with the paths in the breadth-first search forest connecting its two endpoints to their lowest common ancestor forms an odd cycle. If the algorithm terminates without finding an odd cycle in this way, then it must have found a proper coloring, and can safely conclude that the graph is bipartite."], "wikipedia-581797": ["In an \"unweighted bipartite graph\", the optimization problem is to find a maximum cardinality matching.

The team of \"street smarts\" specifically picked a burger that they would be able to make an effective marketing campaign out of. They were able to incorporate a Western theme in their restaurant, along with a contest for two round-trip tickets to Las Vegas, that encouraged customers to buy their burger. Net Worth also had three cashiers and eight members trained for the restaurant, and were able to successfully upsell their burger.\nBULLET::::- Reward: Dinner with Trump at the famed Club 21 restaurant.\nBULLET::::- Losing team: Magna\nBULLET::::- Reasons for loss: Magna had trained six people and only had two cashiers in their restaurant, which led to a bad point of sale and long lines. They also had an awful promotion scheme.\nBULLET::::- Boardroom tension: Danny was singled out by nearly the entire team for handling their marketing strategies. Kendra was the only one to blame Todd for his inability to control Danny, which impressed Carolyn. In the boardroom, Alex pointed out that he was responsible for only training two cashiers at the restaurant, which bothered Trump and his advisors.\nBULLET::::- Sent to boardroom: Todd, Alex, Danny\nBULLET::::- Fired: Todd Everett \u2013 for having no leadership ability, being unable to control his team, and for making poor delegations. While Alex doomed the team by training only two cashiers and Danny was considered a loose cannon, Trump felt they were capable of being led and that Todd's lack of leadership was the primary reason they failed.\nBULLET::::- Notes:\nBULLET::::- Trump was unimpressed that the college graduates were beaten by the high school graduates. He asked Magna if he wasted his time getting a college degree \u2013 Todd quickly assured him this was not the case.\nBULLET::::- This is the first time in Apprentice history where the losing project manager is the first to be fired.\nBULLET::::- Magna's score rating: 3.96\nBULLET::::- Reasons for victory: Magna's scores for the motel's rooms and facilities were only slightly better than Net Worth's, but Danny decided to throw a pool party, which created a good atmosphere among the guests and a fantastic customer service rating. Their plans for breakfast were nearly scuppered when Verna (who was supposed to be in charge of looking after the guests) abruptly left the motel, claiming that she was too stressed to continue in the process, but Carolyn chased after her and persuaded her to return, while Bren helped to salvage the breakfast situation.\nBULLET::::- Reward: An evening of dinner, drinks, and cigars with businessman Steve Forbes aboard his yacht.\nBULLET::::- Losing team: Net Worth\nBULLET::::- Net Worth's score rating: 2.92\nBULLET::::- Reasons for loss: Brian's decision to spend almost the entire budget on renovating the bathrooms and building full-length wardrobes did not improve the ratings by as much as he had hoped, and the dirty rooms with bad carpeting decimated their overall rating. Even more damaging was a massive attack between Brian and Kristen right in front of the motel and their guests; while Angie and Audrey attempted to diffuse it, Kristen refused to calm down and started yapping at the women as well.\nBULLET::::- Final Boardroom: No internal review \u2013 Brian immediately admitted that the defeat was wholly his fault, and said that he should be fired.\nBULLET::::- Fired: Brian McDowell \u2013 for wasting money on many replacement toilets, the fact that no one liked him as a team leader, not having a set budget, being an incompetent leader, and for saying that Trump should fire him.\nBULLET::::- Notes:\nBULLET::::- At the start of the boardroom, Trump told John that he was exempt from being fired, and then jokingly asked him if he'd like to waive his exemption, referencing former candidate Bradford Cohen's actions in the second episode of the previous season. John held onto the exemption however, noting that even if he didn't get himself instantly fired by doing that, he had argued with Brian several times during the task (though unlike Kristen, John stopped doing so after the guests arrived) and would have been one of his main targets were he not exempt.\nBULLET::::- While questioning other members of Net Worth, Angie told Chris that she was disappointed in how much he contributed to the task due to him previously boasting to the team about his experience in renovation, this caused Chris to lose his temper and yell at Angie that he did not have hands-on experience in renovation, which Angie did not find satisfactory and when questioned further by Trump, Angie said that Chris should be fired over Brian because she believed Brian had more leadership potential. This marks the first of several times that Chris loses his temper in the boardroom.\nBULLET::::- Although the episode made it seem like there was more debate after Brian requested his termination, Donald Trump said at that point that Brian was finished. He then questioned the other team members about issues and problems not related to Brian (mostly Kristen's disrespectful behavior towards the other team members, and Chris's lackluster contribution to the task), before picking up the thread and telling Brian to get lost."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

While this question remains open, recent years witnessed a plethora of breakthroughs related to approximating TSP solutions such as the first constant factor approximation for asymmetric TSP (ATSP) with triangle inequality by Svensson et al. [STV18] and an algorithm generalizing the 1.5-approximation to the more general path-TSP by Traub and Vygen [TV19] and Zenklusen [Zen19]. Another, perhaps even more classic, line of research is to solve TSP exactly as fast as possible in the worst case. Of course we do not expect to solve the problem in polynomial time since its decision variant is NP-complete, but nevertheless it is of interest to determine how fast it can be solved. This study was initiated already in the 1920\u2019s by Menger (see [Sch05] for an historial account). In 1962, Bellman [Bel62] and, independently, Held and Karp [ HK62] proposed a Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm with table entries defined for each subset of the vertices to build partial tours. We quote the following excerpt from the popular text book \u2018In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman\u2019 about this result: \u201cThis team\u2019s dynamic programming algorithm solves any instance in time proportial to \ud835\udc5b22\ud835\udc5b, and this is where we still stand, after nearly fifty years.

At the Riga Summit NATO nations agreed to lift caveats in a time of an emergency, however the definition of an emergency is debatable.\n\nThe problem of National Caveats is not new and was identified as a problem during the KFOR mission in Kosovo in 1999. NATO leaders met in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2005 to address the matter of national caveats. They passed RESOLUTION 336 on REDUCING NATIONAL CAVEATS, but the resolution was non-binding, meaning that nations could apply it as they deemed fit.\n\nIn November 2006, NATO held the Riga Summit. At the meetings, President George W. Bush called for countries to lift caveats. However, many analysts say the problem has not been solved. For instance, political scientist Joseph Nye stated in a 2006 article that \"many NATO countries with troops in Afghanistan have \"national caveats\" that restrict how their troops may be used. While the Riga summit relaxed some of these caveats to allow assistance to allies in dire circumstances, Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, and the US are doing most of the fighting in southern Afghanistan, while French, German, and Italian troops are deployed in the quieter north. It is difficult to see how NATO can succeed in stabilizing Afghanistan unless it is willing to commit more troops and give commanders more flexibility.\"\n\nAfghanistan is NATO's greatest test as to national caveats. The 28 nation alliance is now leading the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Mission in Afghanistan, with some forty-eight diverse nations engaged in the nation building operation. Adding to an already complex task, many of the nations in the mission, whether NATO or not, have attached national caveat restrictions on their forces. This has created opportunities for the insurgents in parts of the country, whilst also causing no small degree of friction within the NATO Alliance proper between those nations willing to send their soldiers to the dangerous parts of the country (to fight), and those not willing to do so.\n\nUS Army Colonel Douglas Mastriano, in a research project at the US Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, discussed the challenges that this dilemma poses to the alliance, and although daunting, argues that one should expect this from a system of independent nations that have divergent interests and political will in regard to Afghanistan. He argues that strategic leaders have to operate with what nations are willing to give and thereby leverage NATO's troops where they can do the most good. Despite the difficulties, Mastriano says, \"When one looks at the ISAF mission holistically, Afghanistan has been good for the alliance. It has expanded its global role, demonstrated that it can conduct a sustained out of area mission, NATO can operate with coalition partners from around the world, it has endurance (now ten years in Afghanistan, and counting) and that it is not easily be intimidated. Despite the Taliban's efforts otherwise, NATO has endured relatively high casualties (higher than many nations anticipated), and despite this, none of these nations have retreated in the face of it.\"\n\nAs to the Afghan mission, Mastriano says, \"Nine years after the 9/11 attacks, things look grim in Afghanistan, but it is not too late. NATO, and her strongest partner, the US, possess both the initiative and ability to turn things around... They simply must do the hard work to create unity of effort and unity of command through capable leadership because losing is not an option.\"\n\nCaveats are also applied in Iraq. According to an article written by Major General Rick Lynch and Lieutenant Colonel Phillip D. Janzen, US Army, \"National caveats on personnel participating in NATO-led operations are not a new challenge. Lessons learned from operations in the Balkans often emphasize the impact of caveats on that mission. Nations contributing personnel to the NATO Training Mission - Iraq (NTM-I) also apply operational caveats to their force offerings, to include restrictions on the place of duty and length of deployment. Operational impacts from caveats are countless but include restricting force protection troops from securing vehicle convoys. Another case involves limiting personnel to duty in Baghdad's International Zone.\""]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2. The term \"caveats\" is often used in academic literature to highlight limitations, assumptions, or contextual constraints of a study.

While this question remains open, recent years witnessed a plethora of breakthroughs related to approximating TSP solutions such as the first constant factor approximation for asymmetric TSP (ATSP) with triangle inequality by Svensson et al. [STV18] and an algorithm generalizing the 1.5-approximation to the more general path-TSP by Traub and Vygen [TV19] and Zenklusen [Zen19]. Another, perhaps even more classic, line of research is to solve TSP exactly as fast as possible in the worst case. Of course we do not expect to solve the problem in polynomial time since its decision variant is NP-complete, but nevertheless it is of interest to determine how fast it can be solved. This study was initiated already in the 1920\u2019s by Menger (see [Sch05] for an historial account).

Why did the universe have such low entropy in the past, and time correlates with the universal (but not local) increase in entropy, from the past and to the future, according to the second law of thermodynamics? Why are CP violations observed in certain weak force decays, but not elsewhere? Are CP violations somehow a product of the second law of thermodynamics, or are they a separate arrow of time? Are there exceptions to the principle of causality? Is there a single possible past? Is the present moment physically distinct from the past and future, or is it merely an emergent property of consciousness? What links the quantum arrow of time to the thermodynamic arrow?\nBULLET::::- Interpretation of quantum mechanics: How does the quantum description of reality, which includes elements such as the superposition of states and wavefunction collapse or quantum decoherence, give rise to the reality we perceive? Another way of stating this question regards the measurement problem: What constitutes a \"measurement\" which apparently causes the wave function to collapse into a definite state? Unlike classical physical processes, some quantum mechanical processes (such as quantum teleportation arising from quantum entanglement) cannot be simultaneously \"local\", \"causal\", and \"real\", but it is not obvious which of these properties must be sacrificed, or if an attempt to describe quantum mechanical processes in these senses is a category error such that a proper understanding of quantum mechanics would render the question meaningless. Can a multiverse resolve it?\nBULLET::::- Grand Unification Theory/Theory of everything: Is there a theory which explains the values of all fundamental physical constants? Is there a theory which explains why the gauge groups of the standard model are as they are, and why observed spacetime has 3 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal dimension? Do \"fundamental physical constants\" vary over time? Are any of the fundamental particles in the standard model of particle physics actually composite particles too tightly bound to observe as such at current experimental energies? Are there fundamental particles that have not yet been observed, and, if so, which ones are they and what are their properties? Are there unobserved fundamental forces?\nBULLET::::- Yang\u2013Mills theory: Given an arbitrary compact gauge group, does a non-trivial quantum Yang\u2013Mills theory with a finite mass gap exist? (This problem is also listed as one of the Millennium Prize Problems in mathematics.)\nBULLET::::- Color confinement: Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) color confinement conjecture is that color charged particles (such as quarks and gluons) cannot be separated from their parent hadron without producing new hadrons. There is not yet an analytic proof of color confinement in any non-abelian gauge theory.\nBULLET::::- Physical information: Are there physical phenomena, such as wave function collapse or black holes, that irrevocably destroy information about their prior states? How is quantum information stored as a state of a quantum system?\nBULLET::::- Dimensionless physical constant: At the present time, the values of the dimensionless physical constants cannot be calculated; they are determined only by physical measurement. What is the minimum number of dimensionless physical constants from which all other dimensionless physical constants can be derived? Are dimensional physical constants necessary at all?\nBULLET::::- Fine-tuned Universe: The values of the fundamental physical constants are in a narrow range necessary to support carbon-based life. Is this because there exist other universes with different constants, or are our universe's constants the result of chance, or some other factor or process? In particular, Tegmark's mathematical multiverse hypothesis of abstract mathematical parallel universe formalized models, and the landscape multiverse hypothesis of spacetime regions having different formalized sets of laws and physical constants from that of the surrounding space \u2014 require formalization.\nBULLET::::- Quantum field theory: Is it possible to construct, in the mathematically rigorous framework of algebraic QFT, a theory in 4-dimensional spacetime that includes interactions and does not resort to perturbative methods?\nBULLET::::- Problem of time: In quantum mechanics time is a classical background parameter and the flow of time is universal and absolute. In general relativity time is one component of four-dimensional spacetime, and the flow of time changes depending on the curvature of spacetime and the spacetime trajectory of the observer. How can these two concepts of time be reconciled?\nBULLET::::- Cosmic inflation: Is the theory of cosmic inflation in the very early universe correct, and, if so, what are the details of this epoch? What is the hypothetical scalar field that gave rise to this cosmic inflation? If inflation happened at one point, is it self-sustaining through inflation of quantum-mechanical fluctuations, and thus ongoing in some extremely distant place?\nBULLET::::- Horizon problem: Why is the distant universe so homogeneous when the Big Bang theory seems to predict larger measurable anisotropies of the night sky than those observed? Cosmological inflation is generally accepted as the solution, but are other possible explanations such as a variable speed of light more appropriate?\nBULLET::::- Origin and future of the universe: How did the conditions for anything to exist arise? Is the universe heading towards a Big Freeze, a Big Rip, a Big Crunch, or a Big Bounce? Or is it part of an infinitely recurring cyclic model?\nBULLET::::- Size of universe: The diameter of the observable universe is about 93 billion light-years, but what is the size of the whole universe?\nBULLET::::- Baryon asymmetry: Why is there far more matter than antimatter in the observable universe?\nBULLET::::- Cosmological constant problem: Why does the zero-point energy of the vacuum not cause a large cosmological constant? What cancels it out?\nBULLET::::- Dark matter: What is the identity of dark matter? Is it a particle? Is it the lightest superpartner (LSP)? Or, do the phenomena attributed to dark matter point not to some form of matter but actually to an extension of gravity?\nBULLET::::- Dark energy: What is the cause of the observed accelerated expansion (de Sitter phase) of the universe? Why is the energy density of the dark energy component of the same magnitude as the density of matter at present when the two evolve quite differently over time; could it be simply that we are observing at exactly the right time? Is dark energy a pure cosmological constant or are models of quintessence such as phantom energy applicable?\nBULLET::::- Dark flow: Is a non-spherically symmetric gravitational pull from outside the observable universe responsible for some of the observed motion of large objects such as galactic clusters in the universe?\nBULLET::::- Axis of evil: Some large features of the microwave sky at distances of over 13 billion light years appear to be aligned with both the motion and orientation of the solar system. Is this due to systematic errors in processing, contamination of results by local effects, or an unexplained violation of the Copernican principle?\nBULLET::::- Shape of the universe: What is the 3-manifold of comoving space, i.e. of a comoving spatial section of the universe, informally called the \"shape\" of the universe? Neither the curvature nor the topology is presently known, though the curvature is known to be \"close\" to zero on observable scales. The cosmic inflation hypothesis suggests that the shape of the universe may be unmeasurable, but, since 2003, Jean-Pierre Luminet, et al., and other groups have suggested that the shape of the universe may be the Poincar\u00e9 dodecahedral space. Is the shape unmeasurable; the Poincar\u00e9 space; or another 3-manifold?\nBULLET::::- The largest structures in the universe are larger than expected. Current cosmological models say there should be very little structure on scales larger than a few hundred million light years across, due to the expansion of the universe trumping the effect of gravity. But the Sloan Great Wall is 1.38 billion light-years in length. And the largest structure currently known, the Hercules\u2013Corona Borealis Great Wall, is up to 10 billion light-years in length. Are these actual structures or random density fluctuations? If they are real structures they contradict the '' hypothesis which asserts that at a scale of 300 million light-years structures seen in smaller surveys are randomized to the extent that the smooth distribution of the universe is visually apparent."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The protocol for transcription should explicitly state criteria of transcription. Inserting comments like \"*voice lowered*\" will signal a change in the speech.

A general guideline to follow when transcribing includes a ratio of 15 minutes of transcription for every 5 minutes of dialog.\nAfter this stage, the researcher should feel familiar with the content of the data and should be able to identify overt patterns or repeating issues in one or more interviews. These patterns should be recorded in a reflexivity journal where they will be of use when coding and checking for accuracy.

The rationale capture procedure normally applied in the simulation/execution activity of the evolving design uses two phases: Phase I describes the problem and Phase II develops a solution strategy.\nDesign is an iterative procedure involving partitioning, classification/specification, assembly, simulation, and re-partitioning activities, see Figure. First, the design is partitioned into design artifacts. Each artifact is either classified against existing design artifacts or an external specification is developed for it. The external specification enables the internal specification of the design artifact to be delegated and performed concurrently. After classification/specification, the interfaces between the design artifacts are specified in\nthe assembly activity (i.e., static, dynamic, and behavioral models detailing different aspects of the interaction between design artifacts are developed). While the models are developed, it is important to simulate use scenarios or use cases between design artifacts to uncover design flaws. By analyzing these flaws, the designer can re-arrange the existing models and simulate them until the designer is satisfied. The observed design flaws and the actions contemplated and taken for each are the basis of the design rationale capture procedure.\nBULLET::::- Identify Problems\nThe designer identifies problems in the current design state by stepping through the use cases in the requirements model to validate that the design satisfies requirements and to verify that the design will function as intended. The designer records symptoms or concerns about the current design state. A symptom is an observation of an operational failure or undesirable condition in the existing design. A concern is an observation of an anticipated failure or undesirable condition in the existing design.\nBULLET::::- Identify Constraints\nThe designer then identifies the constraints that the problems violate or potentially violate. These constraints include requirements, goals, physical laws, conventions, assumptions, models, and resources. Because the activities and processes in the use case scenarios map to requirements and goals, the failure of the design in any use case activity or process can be traced directly to requirements statements and goal statements.\nBULLET::::- Identify Needs\nThe designer then identifies the necessary conditions or needs for solving the problems. A need is a necessary condition that must be met if a particular problem or set of problems is to be solved. It is possible that the needs statement will have to describe the essentiality for relaxing requirements and goal constraints governing the design.\nBULLET::::- Formulate Goals and Requirements\nOnce the needs for the design transition have been identified, the designer formulates\nBULLET::::1. requirements that the solution must satisfy and\nBULLET::::2. goals that the solution should attempt to satisfy.\nA requirement is a constraint on either the functional, behavioral, physical, or method of development aspects of a solution.

Others define weight as a scalar quantity, the magnitude of the gravitational force. Others define it as the magnitude of the reaction force exerted on a body by mechanisms that keep it in place: the weight is the quantity that is measured by, for example, a spring scale. Thus, in a state of free fall, the weight would be zero.

If the paper is rigorous, it should provide either a proof or a reference to prior work supporting the claim.", "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/65": ["We show that a cut in C\ud835\udc61 \u2229 [\ud835\udc61] \ud835\udc58 can be encoded in a unique way as a quadruple (\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52,\ud835\udc34\u210e,\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc53), where \ud835\udc50 \u2264\ud835\udc61/2 is an integer, \ud835\udc34\u210e \u2286[\ud835\udc50], \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52 \u2208 \ud835\udc58/2 \ud835\udc50/2 and \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc53 \u2208 (\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc58)/2 \ud835\udc50/2. Note this is sufficient to prove the desired claim as the number of such quadruples equals the claimed upper bound on the basis cuts. Fix a basis cut \ud835\udc36(\ud835\udc4e) satisfying |\ud835\udc36(\ud835\udc4e)|= \ud835\udc58. For even \ud835\udc57 < \ud835\udc61, we refer to \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc57 +1 as a group and call it empty, half and full if |{\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc57 +1}\u2229\ud835\udc36(\ud835\udc4e)| equals 0, 1 and 2, respectively. Similarly, we call group \ud835\udc61 full if \ud835\udc61 \u2208 \ud835\udc36(\ud835\udc4e) and we call it empty otherwise. The first parameter \ud835\udc50 in the encoding describes the number of half groups. This implies that there are (\ud835\udc58\u2212\ud835\udc50)/2 full groups and thus (\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc58\u2212\ud835\udc50)/2 remaining empty groups. The crucial observation that directly follows from the definition of the basis cuts is that all full groups can only occur after an even number of half groups and all empty groups can only occur after an odd number of half groups. Therefore, we can describe the state (i.e. empty, half or full) of each group with \ud835\udc50 and two integer partitions \ud835\udc521 +\ud835\udc522 +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+ \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50/2+1 = \ud835\udc52 and \ud835\udc531 +\ud835\udc532 +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+ \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc50/2+1 = \ud835\udc53 into non-negative integers where \ud835\udc52 = (\ud835\udc61 \u2212\ud835\udc58 \u2212\ud835\udc50)/2 is the total number of empty groups and \ud835\udc53 = (\ud835\udc58\u2212\ud835\udc50)/2 is the total number of full groups. Note that for both the empty and full groups we have at most \ud835\udc50/2 alternatives on which of two consecutive half groups we place them. It is well known that the number of integer partitions \ud835\udc4e1 +... + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udc4e into non-negative integers can be injectively encoded as a subset \ud835\udc34 \u2286 \ud835\udc4e+\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58. Thus we can encode \ud835\udc521,...,\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50/2+1 as \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52 and \ud835\udc531,...,\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc50/2+1 as \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc53. This uniquely determines which group is empty, half and full, and it only remains to describe of each half group which vertex is in and which one is not. For this, the remaining set \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52 can be used."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-271723": 1, "wikipedia-30977": 1, "wikipedia-29543748": 1, "wikipedia-25702256": 1, "wikipedia-5785677": 1, "wikipedia-435063": 1, "wikipedia-275053": 1, "wikipedia-38024": 1, "wikipedia-6595367": 1, "wikipedia-1032155": 1, "arxiv-hep-th/9306032": 1, "arxiv-2012.05822": 1, "arxiv-1004.1065": 1, "arxiv-hep-th/9911064": 1, "arxiv-1004.4874": 1, "arxiv-1210.3740": 1, "arxiv-2306.10880": 1, "arxiv-0712.3628": 1, "arxiv-2301.07065": 1, "arxiv-1909.05380": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/99": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/93": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/104": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/84": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/65": 2, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/46": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/68": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/58": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/88": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/70": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-271723": 1, "wikipedia-30977": 1, "wikipedia-29543748": 1, "wikipedia-25702256": 1, "wikipedia-5785677": 1, "wikipedia-435063": 1, "wikipedia-275053": 1, "wikipedia-38024": 1, "wikipedia-6595367": 1, "wikipedia-1032155": 1, "arxiv-hep-th/9306032": 1, "arxiv-2012.05822": 1, "arxiv-1004.1065": 1, "arxiv-hep-th/9911064": 1, "arxiv-1004.4874": 1, "arxiv-1210.3740": 1, "arxiv-2306.10880": 1, "arxiv-0712.3628": 1, "arxiv-2301.07065": 1, "arxiv-1909.05380": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/99": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/93": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/104": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/84": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/65": 3, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/46": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/68": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/58": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/88": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/70": 1}}}

Then, traverse the links in the implication graph and select as final pieces all pieces that are reachable from \"I\". There are two good scenarios: either we allocate a single final piece to each partner and we are done, or we\nreach a piece with no outgoing links (which implies that it does not intersect other pieces). In the latter case we just pick another piece of one of the remaining partners and continue. The bad scenario is that our traversal leads us to two different pieces of the same partner, or equivalently to the other piece of partner \"i\" from whom we started.

Evaluators may opt to carry this step by bringing such parties together and asking them to generate and discuss the mission of the program. The logic behind this approach is to show each party that there may be divergent views of what the program mission actually is.\n\nSection::::Empowerment evaluation.:Taking stock.\nTaking stock as the second step consists of two important tasks. The first task is concerned with program participants and program staff generating a list of current key activities that are crucial to the functioning of the program. The second task is concerned with rating the identified key activities, also known as \"prioritization\". For example, each party member may be asked to rate each key activity on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important and 1 the least important. The role of the evaluator during this task is to facilitate interactive discussion amongst members in an attempt to establish some baseline of shared meaning and understanding pertaining to the key activities.In addition, relevant documentation (such as financial reports and curriculum information) may be brought into the discussion when considering some of the key activities.\n\nSection::::Empowerment evaluation.:Planning for the future.\nAfter prioritizing the key activities the next step is to plan for the future. Here the evaluator asks program participants and program staff how they would like to improve the program in relation to the key activities listed. The objective is to create a thread of coherence whereby the mission generated (step 1) guides the stock take (step 2) which forms the basis for the plans for the future (step 3). Thus, in planning for the future specific goals are aligned with relevant key activities. In addition to this it is also important for program participants and program staff to identify possible forms of evidence (measurable indicators) which can be used to monitor progress towards specific goals.

probabilities.:Bounding the conditional probability of failure.\nWe want to be able to set each variable formula_75 in turn\nso as to keep the conditional probability of failure below 1.\nTo do this, we need a good bound on the conditional probability of failure.\nThe bound will come by refining the original existence proof.\nThat proof implicitly bounds the probability of failure\nby the expectation of the random variable\nwhere\nis the set of elements left uncovered at the end.\nThe random variable formula_101 may appear a bit mysterious,\nbut it mirrors the probabilistic proof in a systematic way.\nThe first term in formula_101 comes from applying Markov's inequality\nto bound the probability of the first bad event (the cost is too high).\nIt contributes at least 1 to formula_101 if the cost of formula_3 is too high.\nThe second term\ncounts the number of bad events of the second kind (uncovered elements).\nIt contributes at least 1 to formula_101 if formula_3 leaves any element uncovered.\nThus, in any outcome where formula_101 is less than 1,\nformula_3 must cover all the elements\nand have cost meeting the desired bound from the lemma.\nIn short, if the rounding step fails, then formula_109.\nThis implies (by Markov's inequality) that\n\"formula_110 is an upper bound on the probability of failure.\"\nNote that the argument above is implicit already in the proof of the lemma,\nwhich also shows by calculation that formula_111.\nTo apply the method of conditional probabilities,\nwe need to extend the argument to bound the \"conditional\" probability of failure\nas the rounding step proceeds.\nUsually, this can be done in a systematic way,\nalthough it can be technically tedious.\nSo, what about the \"conditional\" probability of failure as the rounding step iterates through the sets?\nSince formula_109 in any outcome where the rounding step fails,\nby Markov's inequality, the \"conditional\" probability of failure\nis at most the \"conditional\" expectation of formula_101.\nNext we calculate the conditional expectation of formula_101,\nmuch as we calculated the unconditioned expectation of formula_101 in the original proof.\nConsider the state of the rounding process at the end of some iteration formula_116.\nLet formula_117 denote the sets considered so far\n(the first formula_116 sets in formula_28).\nLet formula_120 denote the (partially assigned) vector formula_3\n(so formula_122 is determined only if formula_123).\nFor each set formula_124,\nlet formula_125\ndenote the probability with which formula_75 will be set to 1.\nLet formula_127 contain the not-yet-covered elements.\nThen the conditional expectation of formula_101,\ngiven the choices made so far, that is, given formula_120, is\nNote that formula_131 is determined only after iteration formula_116.\nSection::::Set cover example.:Derandomization using the method of conditional probabilities.:Keeping the conditional probability of failure below 1.\nTo keep the conditional probability of failure below 1,\nit suffices to keep the conditional expectation of formula_101 below 1.\nTo do this, it suffices to keep the conditional expectation of formula_101 from increasing.\nThis is what the algorithm will do.\nIt will set formula_75 in each iteration to ensure that\n(where formula_137).\nIn the formula_116th iteration,\nhow can the algorithm set formula_139\nto ensure that formula_140?\nIt turns out that it can simply set formula_139\nso as to \"minimize\" the resulting value of formula_142.\nTo see why, focus on the point in time when iteration formula_116 starts.\nAt that time, formula_144 is determined,\nbut formula_142 is not yet determined\n--- it can take two possible values depending on how formula_139\nis set in iteration formula_116.\nLet formula_148 denote the value of formula_149.\nLet formula_150 and formula_151,\ndenote the two possible values of formula_142,\ndepending on whether formula_139 is set to 0, or 1, respectively.\nBy the definition of conditional expectation,\nSince a weighted average of two quantities\nis always at least the minimum of those two quantities,\nit follows that\nThus, setting formula_139\nso as to minimize the resulting value of\nformula_131\nwill guarantee that\nformula_158.\nThis is what the algorithm will do.\nIn detail, what does this mean?\nConsidered as a function of formula_139\nformula_131\nis a linear function of formula_139,\nand the coefficient of formula_139 in that function is\nThus, the algorithm should set formula_139 to

The insurance industry and markets use actuarial science to determine pricing and make trading decisions. Governments apply probabilistic methods in environmental regulation, entitlement analysis (Reliability theory of aging and longevity), and financial regulation.\nA good example of the use of probability theory in equity trading is the effect of the perceived probability of any widespread Middle East conflict on oil prices, which have ripple effects in the economy as a whole. An assessment by a commodity trader that a war is more likely can send that commodity's prices up or down, and signals other traders of that opinion. Accordingly, the probabilities are neither assessed independently nor necessarily very rationally. The theory of behavioral finance emerged to describe the effect of such groupthink on pricing, on policy, and on peace and conflict.\nIn addition to financial assessment, probability can be used to analyze trends in biology (e.g. disease spread) as well as ecology (e.g. biological Punnett squares). As with finance, risk assessment can be used as a statistical tool to calculate the likelihood of undesirable events occurring and can assist with implementing protocols to avoid encountering such circumstances. Probability is used to design games of chance so that casinos can make a guaranteed profit, yet provide payouts to players that are frequent enough to encourage continued play.\nThe discovery of rigorous methods to assess and combine probability assessments has changed society.\nAnother significant application of probability theory in everyday life is reliability. Many consumer products, such as automobiles and consumer electronics, use reliability theory in product design to reduce the probability of failure. Failure probability may influence a manufacturer's decisions on a product's warranty.\nThe cache language model and other statistical language models that are used in natural language processing are also examples of applications of probability theory."], "wikipedia-50802539": ["The probability of success is a concept closely related to conditional power and predictive power. Conditional power is the probability of observing statistical significance given the observed data assuming the treatment effect parameter equals a specific value. Conditional power is often criticized for this assumption. If we know the exact value of the treatment effect, there is no need to do the experiment. To address this issue, we can consider conditional power in a Bayesian setting by considering the treatment effect parameter to be a random variable. Taking the expected value of the conditional power with respect to the posterior distribution of the parameter gives the predictive power. Predictive power can also be calculated in a frequentist setting. No matter how it is calculated, predictive power is a random variable since it is a conditional probability conditioned on randomly observed data. Both conditional power and predictive power use statistical significance as the success criterion. However, statistical significance is often not sufficient to define success. For example, a health authority often requires the magnitude of the treatment effect to be bigger than an effect which is merely statistically significant in order to support successful registration. In order to address this issue, we can extend conditional power and predictive power to the concept of probability of success. For probability of success, the success criterion is not restricted to statistical significance. It can be something else such as a clinical meaningful result."], "wikipedia-3784665": ["Representing probabilities in this way has several practical advantages:\nBULLET::::1. Speed.

For instance, a risk-neutral measure is a probability measure which assumes that the current value of assets is the expected value of the future payoff taken with respect to that same risk neutral measure (i.e. calculated using the corresponding risk neutral density function), and discounted at the risk-free rate. If there is a unique probability measure that must be used to price assets in a market, then the market is called a complete market.\nNot all measures that intuitively represent chance or likelihood are probability measures. For instance, although the fundamental concept of a system in statistical mechanics is a measure space, such measures are not always probability measures. In general, in statistical physics, if we consider sentences of the form \"the probability of a system S assuming state A is p\" the geometry of the system does not always lead to the definition of a probability measure under congruence, although it may do so in the case of systems with just one degree of freedom.\nProbability measures are also used in mathematical biology.

In the Kidney Stone example above, it is clear that if one is diagnosed with \"Small Stones\" or \"Large Stones\" the data for the respective subpopulation should be consulted and Treatment A would be preferred to Treatment B. But what if a patient is not diagnosed, and the size of the stone is not known; would it be appropriate to consult the aggregated data and administer Treatment B? This would stand contrary to common sense; a treatment that is preferred both under one condition and under its negation should also be preferred when the condition is unknown.\n\nOn the other hand, if the partitioned data is to be preferred \"a priori\", what prevents one from partitioning the data into arbitrary sub-categories (say based on eye color or post-treatment pain) artificially constructed to yield wrong choices of treatments? Pearl shows that, indeed, in many cases it is the aggregated, not the partitioned data that gives the correct choice of action. Worse yet, given the same table, one should sometimes follow the partitioned and sometimes the aggregated data, depending on the story behind the data, with each story dictating its own choice. Pearl considers this to be the real paradox behind Simpson's reversal.\n\nAs to why and how a story, not data, should dictate choices, the answer is that it is the story which encodes the causal relationships among the variables. Once we explicate these relationships and represent them formally, we can test which partition gives the correct treatment preference. For example, if we represent causal relationships in a graph called \"causal diagram\" (see Bayesian networks), we can test whether nodes that represent the proposed partition intercept spurious paths in the diagram.

Its simple statement and clear applicability \u2013 a salesman needs to find the shortest tour through\ud835\udc5bdifferent cities \u2013 make the problem extremely attractive. From a theoretical perspective, the problem poses crisp yet very challenging research challenges that make it representative for many NP-complete problems. As an example, improving the famous polynomial time 1.5-approximation algorithm by Christofides [ Chr76] (and independently, by Serdyukov [Ser78]) is one of the favorite open questions in the theory of approximation algorithms. While this question remains open, recent years witnessed a plethora of breakthroughs related to approximating TSP solutions such as the first constant factor approximation for asymmetric TSP (ATSP) with triangle inequality by Svensson et al. [STV18] and an algorithm generalizing the 1.5-approximation to the more general path-TSP by Traub and Vygen [TV19] and Zenklusen [Zen19]. Another, perhaps even more classic, line of research is to solve TSP exactly as fast as possible in the worst case. Of course we do not expect to solve the problem in polynomial time since its decision variant is NP-complete, but nevertheless it is of interest to determine how fast it can be solved. This study was initiated already in the 1920\u2019s by Menger (see [Sch05] for an historial account). In 1962, Bellman [Bel62] and, independently, Held and Karp [ HK62] proposed a Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm with table entries defined for each subset of the vertices to build partial tours. We quote the following excerpt from the popular text book \u2018In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman\u2019 about this result: \u201cThis team\u2019s dynamic programming algorithm solves any instance in time proportial to \ud835\udc5b22\ud835\udc5b, and this is where we still stand, after nearly fifty years. A revolution may be overstating what is needed to push beyond Held-Karp, but it clearly is going to take an exciting new idea.\u201d \u2014 William Cook [Coo11] As also formalized in [Coo11], the research challenge can be more precisely stated as follows: Open Question 1: Can (A)TSP on \ud835\udc5b cities be solved in\ud835\udc42((2\u2212\ud835\udf00)\ud835\udc5b)time, for some constant\ud835\udf00 > 0? A positive answer to Open Question 1 would be valuable because of several reasons: First, generally speaking, \u2018improved algorithms\u2019 such as the one asked here would indicate that relatively simple approaches can be improved and thus that the computational landscape of worst-case complexity of NP-complete problems is even more complex than we may think.

To do this, it suffices to keep the conditional expectation of formula_101 from increasing. This is what the algorithm will do. It will set formula_75 in each iteration to ensure that (where formula_137). In the formula_116th iteration, how can the algorithm set formula_139 to ensure that formula_140? It turns out that it can simply set formula_139 so as to \"minimize\" the resulting value of formula_142. To see why, focus on the point in time when iteration formula_116 starts. At that time, formula_144 is determined, but formula_142 is not yet determined --- it can take two possible values depending on how formula_139 is set in iteration formula_116. Let formula_148 denote the value of formula_149. Let formula_150 and formula_151, denote the two possible values of formula_142, depending on whether formula_139 is set to 0, or 1, respectively. By the definition of conditional expectation, Since a weighted average of two quantities is always at least the minimum of those two quantities, it follows that Thus, setting formula_139 so as to minimize the resulting value of formula_131 will guarantee that formula_158. This is what the algorithm will do. In detail, what does this mean?

Thus, if one can find an orientation of \"G\" to align all signs of the terms in Pfaffian (no matter \"+\" or \"-\" ), then the absolute value of the Pfaffian is just the number of perfect matchings in \"G\". The FKT algorithm does such a task for a planar graph \"G\". The orientation it finds is called a Pfaffian orientation. Let \"G\" = (\"V\", \"E\") be an undirected graph with adjacency matrix \"A\". Define \"PM\"(\"n\") to be the set of partitions of \"n\" elements into pairs, then the number of perfecting matchings in \"G\" is Closely related to this is the Pfaffian for an \"n\" by \"n\" matrix \"A\" where sgn(\"M\") is the sign of the permutation \"M\".

Calculate all intensities for all possible combinations of intervals. This means that for every start time and end time combination the intensity of work is calculated. For this the times of all jobs whose arrival time and deadline lie inside the interval are added and divided by the interval length. To speed up the process, only combinations of arrival times and later deadlines need to be considered, as times without arrival of a process or deadline can be shrunk to a smaller interval with the same processes, thus increasing intensity, and negative intervals are invalid. Then the maximum intensity interval is selected. In case of multiple equally intense intervals, one can be chosen at will, as intensities of non-overlapping intervals do not influence each other, and removing a part of an interval will not change the intensity of the rest, as processes are removed proportionally.\nBULLET::::2.

The jobs are executed at the above calculated intensity to fit all jobs inside the interval.\nBULLET::::3. The interval is removed from the timeline, as no more calculations can be scheduled here. To simplify further calculations, all arrival times and deadlines of remaining jobs are recalculated to omit already occupied times. For example, assume a job formula_20 with arrival time formula_21, deadline formula_22 and a workload formula_23, and a job formula_24 with formula_25, formula_26 and formula_27. Assume the previous interval was from time formula_28 to formula_29. To omit this interval the times of formula_20 and formula_24 need to be adjusted; workloads are unaffected, as no work has been done for either formula_20 or formula_24. formula_34 stays the same, as it's unaffected by later omissions. formula_35, however, needs to be changed to formula_36, as formula_37. This is the time job formula_20 has left before its deadline. The arrival time formula_39 becomes formula_28, as it would have been inside the removed interval. formula_41 also becomes formula_36, as the time left after the removed interval is formula_43.

It is assumed that the container formula_2 will hold the \"k\"-shortest path, whereas the container formula_3, will hold the potential \"k\"-shortest paths. To determine formula_4, the shortest path from the source to the sink, any efficient shortest path algorithm can be used.\nTo find the formula_1, where formula_6 ranges from formula_7 to formula_8, the algorithm assumes that all paths from formula_4 to formula_10 have previously been found. The formula_6 iteration can be divided into two processes, finding all the deviations formula_12 and choosing a minimum length path to become formula_1. Note that in this iteration, formula_14 ranges from formula_15 to formula_16.\nThe first process can be further subdivided into three operations, choosing the formula_17, finding formula_18, and then adding formula_12 to the container formula_3. The root path, formula_17, is chosen by finding the subpath in formula_10 that follows the first formula_14 nodes of formula_24, where formula_25 ranges from formula_15 to formula_27. Then, if a path is found, the cost of edge formula_28 of formula_24 is set to infinity. Next, the spur path, formula_18, is found by computing the shortest path from the spur node, node formula_14, to the sink. The removal of previous used edges from formula_32 to formula_33 ensures that the spur path is different. formula_34, the addition of the root path and the spur path, is added to formula_3. Next, the edges that were removed, i.e. had their cost set to infinity, are restored to their initial values.\nThe second process determines a suitable path for formula_1 by finding the path in container formula_3 with the lowest cost.

A direct comparison\u2014which is more commonly used\u2014involves the participant rating themselves and the average peer on the same scale, from \"below average\" to \"above average\" and results in participants being far more self-serving. Researchers have suggested that this occurs due to the closer comparison between the individual and the average peer, however use of this method means that it is impossible to know whether a participant has overestimated themselves, underestimated the average peer, or both.\nThe indirect method of comparison involves participants rating themselves and the average peer on separate scales and the illusory superiority effect is found by taking the average peer score away from the individual's score (with a higher score indicating a greater effect). While the indirect comparison method is used less often it is more informative in terms of whether participants have overestimated themselves or underestimated the average peer, and can therefore provide more information about the nature of illusory superiority."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Note this is sufficient to prove the desired claim as the number of such quadruples equals the claimed upper bound on the basis cuts. Fix a basis cut \ud835\udc36(\ud835\udc4e) satisfying |\ud835\udc36(\ud835\udc4e)|= \ud835\udc58. For even \ud835\udc57 < \ud835\udc61, we refer to \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc57 +1 as a group and call it empty, half and full if |{\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc57 +1}\u2229\ud835\udc36(\ud835\udc4e)| equals 0, 1 and 2, respectively.

The crucial observation that directly follows from the definition of the basis cuts is that all full groups can only occur after an even number of half groups and all empty groups can only occur after an odd number of half groups.

Plug and feather sets are then inserted in the holes with the \"ears\" of the feathers facing the direction of the desired split. The plugs are then struck with hammer in sequence.

As mentioned in the introduction, the basic idea of the reduction is as follows: The starting point is an algorithm from [BCKN15] that solves TSP in\ud835\udc42((2+2\ud835\udf14/2)pw\ud835\udc5b) time. Note that this algorithm already solves TSP on bipartite graphs in 2\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc42(1) if \ud835\udf14 = 2. Moreover, the algorithm only computes \ud835\udc42((2 + \u221a2)\ud835\udc5b/2\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc42(1)) bits of data, and the only bottleneck of the algorithm is the computation of representative sets. Let \ud835\udc3a = (\ud835\udc3f \u222a\ud835\udc45,\ud835\udc38) be an undirected bipartite graph and let \ud835\udc64 : \ud835\udc38 \u2192R. We can assume that |\ud835\udc3f|= |\ud835\udc45|= \ud835\udc5b/2, as otherwise \ud835\udc3a has no Hamiltonian cycle. A bipartite graph has a special path decomposition in which each bag contains \ud835\udc3f and the vertices in \ud835\udc45 are one by one introduced and forgotten. Our approach is to compute all table entries corresponding to the the sub-problem where half (say \ud835\udc45\u2032) of the vertices are introduced. Afterwards we do the same for \ud835\udc45\\\ud835\udc45\u2032. To compute all these table entries within the time bound we slightly lower the frequency of calls to the procedure reducematchings from Theorem 4. Concretely, we split \ud835\udc45\u2032 in \ud835\udc451 and \ud835\udc452, where |\ud835\udc451|= \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5b/2 and |\ud835\udc452|= (1/2 \u2212\ud835\udefc)\ud835\udc5b/2 and \ud835\udefc will be a small constant. Then we find representative sets for sub-solutions using \ud835\udc451 and \ud835\udc452 and take all combinations without reducing the number of sub-solutions with reducematchings afterwards. While this avoids the computational bottleneck in the run time, it causes different problems as an increase in sub-solutions also increases the run time. Here Theorem 2 comes to the rescue: Given the sub-solutions using both \ud835\udc45 and \ud835\udc45\u2032, it finds the minimum weight pair fast enough to compensate for the increased number of sub-solutions."], "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/4": ["Of course we do not expect to solve the problem in polynomial time since its decision variant is NP-complete, but nevertheless it is of interest to determine how fast it can be solved.

Of course we do not expect to solve the problem in polynomial time since its decision variant is NP-complete, but nevertheless it is of interest to determine how fast it can be solved. This study was initiated already in the 1920\u2019s by Menger (see [Sch05] for an historial account). In 1962, Bellman [Bel62] and, independently, Held and Karp [ HK62] proposed a Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm with table entries defined for each subset of the vertices to build partial tours. We quote the following excerpt from the popular text book \u2018In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman\u2019 about this result: \u201cThis team\u2019s dynamic programming algorithm solves any instance in time proportial to \ud835\udc5b22\ud835\udc5b, and this is where we still stand, after nearly fifty years. A revolution may be overstating what is needed to push beyond Held-Karp, but it clearly is going to take an exciting new idea.\u201d \u2014 William Cook [Coo11] As also formalized in [Coo11], the research challenge can be more precisely stated as follows: Open Question 1: Can (A)TSP on \ud835\udc5b cities be solved in\ud835\udc42((2\u2212\ud835\udf00)\ud835\udc5b)time, for some constant\ud835\udf00 > 0? A positive answer to Open Question 1 would be valuable because of several reasons: First, generally speaking, \u2018improved algorithms\u2019 such as the one asked here would indicate that relatively simple approaches can be improved and thus that the computational landscape of worst-case complexity of NP-complete problems is even more complex than we may think.

Variations of these ratings also adjust for luck (an exceptional number of turnovers, field goal successes or failures, etc.), how well a team matches up against its opponents, and allow a team's performance to trend over time. Both ratings are based on a probabilistic iterative-fitting model. In the Performance rating, point margins are converted into probabilities based on the standard deviation of a team's performance from its \"mean\". In this case, a probabilistic model gives greater weight to points score in close games. For the Elo rating, probabilistic outcomes of one and zero are assigned to wins and losses, respectively.

Although there are other proofs that among all Equi-Norm Tight Frames the Equiangular tight Frames (ETFs) bring best worst-case performance, the existence and construction of ETFs on some dimensions is still an open problem. As the construction of Equi-Norm Tight Frames from any arbitrary matrices is very easy and practical compared with ETF matrices, the result of this paper can also provide a practical method to design an improved sensing matrix for Compressive Classification.

They quote Alan Turing's answer to all arguments similar to Dreyfus's:\"we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour ... The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'\"Dreyfus did not anticipate that AI researchers would realize their mistake and begin to work towards new solutions, moving away from the symbolic methods that Dreyfus criticized. In 1965, he did not imagine that such programs would one day be created, so he claimed AI was impossible. In 1965, AI researchers did not imagine that such programs were necessary, so they claimed AI was almost complete.

Oftentimes, the issues arrive because of differences amongst the students, teachers, and other peers within the school who are culturally and linguistically diverse. ESL students are often expected to do the same work as all the other students, which causes frustration, low self-esteem, anxiety, and eventually leads to behavioral problems. Teachers must realize that not every student learns the same and that not all students have received the appropriate schooling to perform at the same level as their counterparts. If teachers become culturally aware and actually get to know their students and the world they come from it becomes easier for the teacher to develop a relationship with the student, gain the student's respect, and ultimately spend more time on the instructional framework opposed to constantly correcting students behavior. In 2010\u20132011 the U.S. Department of Education gathered data making aware that nearly half of the states graduated less than 60 percent of ESL students. However slightly, the achievement gap is progressively decreasing between their white counterparts as more minorities are taking a hold of high school diplomas. If teachers genuinely care for each of their ESL students and it becomes apparent to the students through their lessons, 1 to 1 interactions, etc., graduations rates are going to continue to increase while dropout rates substantially will decrease.

Its simple statement and clear applicability \u2013 a salesman needs to find the shortest tour through\ud835\udc5bdifferent cities \u2013 make the problem extremely attractive. From a theoretical perspective, the problem poses crisp yet very challenging research challenges that make it representative for many NP-complete problems. As an example, improving the famous polynomial time 1.5-approximation algorithm by Christofides [ Chr76] (and independently, by Serdyukov [Ser78]) is one of the favorite open questions in the theory of approximation algorithms. While this question remains open, recent years witnessed a plethora of breakthroughs related to approximating TSP solutions such as the first constant factor approximation for asymmetric TSP (ATSP) with triangle inequality by Svensson et al. [STV18] and an algorithm generalizing the 1.5-approximation to the more general path-TSP by Traub and Vygen [TV19] and Zenklusen [Zen19]. Another, perhaps even more classic, line of research is to solve TSP exactly as fast as possible in the worst case. Of course we do not expect to solve the problem in polynomial time since its decision variant is NP-complete, but nevertheless it is of interest to determine how fast it can be solved. This study was initiated already in the 1920\u2019s by Menger (see [Sch05] for an historial account). In 1962, Bellman [Bel62] and, independently, Held and Karp [ HK62] proposed a Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm with table entries defined for each subset of the vertices to build partial tours. We quote the following excerpt from the popular text book \u2018In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman\u2019 about this result: \u201cThis team\u2019s dynamic programming algorithm solves any instance in time proportial to \ud835\udc5b22\ud835\udc5b, and this is where we still stand, after nearly fifty years. A revolution may be overstating what is needed to push beyond Held-Karp, but it clearly is going to take an exciting new idea.\u201d \u2014 William Cook [Coo11] As also formalized in [Coo11], the research challenge can be more precisely stated as follows: Open Question 1: Can (A)TSP on \ud835\udc5b cities be solved in\ud835\udc42((2\u2212\ud835\udf00)\ud835\udc5b)time, for some constant\ud835\udf00 > 0? A positive answer to Open Question 1 would be valuable because of several reasons: First, generally speaking, \u2018improved algorithms\u2019 such as the one asked here would indicate that relatively simple approaches can be improved and thus that the computational landscape of worst-case complexity of NP-complete problems is even more complex than we may think.

The number of zero-valued elements divided by the total number of elements (e.g., m \u00d7 n for an m \u00d7 n matrix) is called the sparsity of the matrix (which is equal to 1 minus the density of the matrix). Using those definitions, a matrix will be sparse when its sparsity is greater than 0.5.\nConceptually, sparsity corresponds to systems with few pairwise interactions. Consider a line of balls connected by springs from one to the next: this is a sparse system as only adjacent balls are coupled. By contrast, if the same line of balls had springs connecting each ball to all other balls, the system would correspond to a dense matrix. The concept of sparsity is useful in combinatorics and application areas such as network theory, which have a low density of significant data or connections.\nLarge sparse matrices often appear in scientific or engineering applications when solving partial differential equations.\nWhen storing and manipulating sparse matrices on a computer, it is beneficial and often necessary to use specialized algorithms and data structures that take advantage of the sparse structure of the matrix. Operations using standard dense-matrix structures and algorithms are slow and inefficient when applied to large sparse matrices as processing and memory are wasted on the zeroes.

While this question remains open, recent years witnessed a plethora of breakthroughs related to approximating TSP solutions such as the first constant factor approximation for asymmetric TSP (ATSP) with triangle inequality by Svensson et al. [STV18] and an algorithm generalizing the 1.5-approximation to the more general path-TSP by Traub and Vygen [TV19] and Zenklusen [Zen19]. Another, perhaps even more classic, line of research is to solve TSP exactly as fast as possible in the worst case. Of course we do not expect to solve the problem in polynomial time since its decision variant is NP-complete, but nevertheless it is of interest to determine how fast it can be solved. This study was initiated already in the 1920\u2019s by Menger (see [Sch05] for an historial account). In 1962, Bellman [Bel62] and, independently, Held and Karp [ HK62] proposed a Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm with table entries defined for each subset of the vertices to build partial tours. We quote the following excerpt from the popular text book \u2018In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman\u2019 about this result: \u201cThis team\u2019s dynamic programming algorithm solves any instance in time proportial to \ud835\udc5b22\ud835\udc5b, and this is where we still stand, after nearly fifty years.

As any problem \"L\" in NP reduces in polynomial time to \"G\", \"L\" reduces in turn to \"H\" in polynomial time so this new definition implies the previous one.

Wikipedia often contains detailed explanations of mathematical notation across various topics, providing context and definitions that could help clarify the notation used in the problem statement.", "wikipedia-677": ["Mathematical notation, widely used in physics and other sciences, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language. However, for various reasons, several lexical, syntactic and semantic ambiguities remain. Ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts. It is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions. Also, it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, formula_1. Then, if one sees formula_2, there is no way to distinguish whether it means formula_1 multiplied by formula_4, or function formula_5 evaluated at argument equal to formula_4. In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning. Creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities. Many algorithmic languages (C++ and Fortran) require the character * as symbol of multiplication. The Wolfram Language used in Mathematica allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions. Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function and variable; in particular, the expression f=f(x) is qualified as an error. The order of operations may depend on the context. In most programming languages, the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right. Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example, formula_7 is interpreted as formula_8; in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language. In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity. In the scientific journal style, one uses roman letters to denote elementary functions, whereas variables are written using italics. For example, in mathematical journals the expression formula_9 does not denote the sine function, but the product of the three variables formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, although in the informal notation of a slide presentation it may stand for formula_13. Commas in multi-component subscripts and superscripts are sometimes omitted; this is also potentially ambiguous notation. For example, in the notation formula_14, the reader can only infer from the context whether it means a single-index object, taken with the subscript equal to product of variables formula_15, formula_12 and formula_17, or it is an indication to a trivalent tensor."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. **Yes**  \n2. arXiv papers often include detailed explanations of mathematical notation, concepts, and context, particularly in their introductions or preliminaries sections.

Letters in various fonts often have specific, fixed meanings in particular areas of mathematics. A mathematical article or a theorem typically starts from the definitions of the introduced symbols, such as: \"Let \"G\" = (\"V\", \"E\") be a graph with the vertex set \"V\" and edge set \"E\"...\". Theoretically it is admissible to write \"Let \"X\" = (\"a\", \"q\") be a graph with the vertex set \"a\" and edge set \"q\"...\"; however, this would decrease readability, since the reader has to consciously memorize these unusual notations in a limited context.\nUsage of subscripts and superscripts is also an important convention. In the early days of computers with limited graphical capabilities for text, subscripts and superscripts were represented with the help of additional notation. In particular, \"n\" could be written as n^2 or n**2 (the latter borrowed from FORTRAN) and \"n\" could be written as n_2.\nIn general, anything that represents a variable (for example, \"h\" for a patient's height) should be set in italic, and everything else should be set in roman type. This applies equally to characters from the Latin/English alphabet (a, b, c, ...; A, B, C, ...) as to letters from any other alphabet, most notably Greek (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, ...; \u0391, \u0392, \u0393, ...). Any operator, such as cos (representing cosine) or \u2211 (representing summation), should therefore be set roman. Note that each element must be set depending upon its own merits, including subscripts and superscripts. Thus, \"h\" would be suitable for the initial height, while \"h\" would represent one instance from a set of heights (\"h\", \"h\", \"h\", ...). Notice that numbers (1, 2, 3, \"etc.\") are not variables, and so are always set roman. Likewise, in some special cases symbols are used to represent general constants, such as \u03c0 used to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and such general constants can be set in roman. (This does not apply to parameters which are merely chosen to not vary.) \nFor vectors, matrices and tensors, it is recommended to set the variable itself in boldface (excluding any associated subscripts or superscripts). Hence, u would be suitable for the initial velocity, while u\" would represent one instance from a set of velocities (u, u, u\", ...). Italic is still used for variables, both for lowercase and for uppercase symbols (Latin, Greek, or otherwise). The only general situation where italic is not used for bolded symbols is for vector operators, such as \u2207 (nabla), set bold and roman.\nThe rules of mathematical typography differ from country to country; thus, American mathematical journals and books will tend to use slightly different conventions from those of European journals.\nOne advantage of mathematical notation is its modularity\u2014it is possible to write extremely complicated formulae involving multiple levels of super- or subscripting, and multiple levels of fraction bars. However, it is considered poor style to set up a formula in such a way as to leave more than a certain number of levels; for example, in non-math publications\nmight be rewritten as\nIncidentally, the above formula demonstrates the American rule that italic type is used for all letters representing variables and parameters except uppercase Greek letters, which are in upright type. Upright type is also standard for digits and punctuation; currently, the ISO-mandated style of using upright for constants (such as e, i) is not widespread. Bold Latin capital letters usually represent matrices, and bold lowercase letters are often used for vectors. The names of well-known functions, such as sin \"x\" (the trigonometric function sine) and exp \"x\" (the constant \"e\" raised to the power of \"x\") are written in lowercase upright letters (and often, as shown here, without parentheses around the argument).\nCertain important constructs are sometimes referred to by blackboard bold letters. For example, some authors denote the set of natural numbers by formula_3. Other authors prefer to use bold Latin for these symbols. (In context of math, font variations such as bold/non-bold may encode an arbitrary relation between symbols; using specialized symbols for formula_3 etc. allows the author more freedom of expressing such relations.)"], "wikipedia-5498479": ["A convenient notation for theoretic scheduling problems was introduced by Ronald Graham, Eugene Lawler, Jan Karel Lenstra and Alexander Rinnooy Kan in.

The \u03b1 field describes the machine environment, \u03b2 the job characteristics and constraints, and \u03b3 the objective function."], "wikipedia-677": ["Section::::Mathematical notation.\nMathematical notation, widely used in physics and other sciences, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language. However, for various reasons, several lexical, syntactic and semantic ambiguities remain.\nSection::::Mathematical notation.:Names of functions.\nThe ambiguity in the style of writing a function should not be confused with a multivalued function, which can (and should) be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way. Several special functions still do not have established notations. Usually, the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument or the resulting value; sometimes, the same name of the function is used, causing confusions. Examples of such underestablished functions:\nBULLET::::- Sinc function\nBULLET::::- Elliptic integral of the third kind; translating elliptic integral form MAPLE to Mathematica, one should replace the second argument to its square, see ; dealing with complex values, this may cause problems.\nBULLET::::- Exponential integral\nBULLET::::- Hermite polynomial\nSection::::Mathematical notation.:Expressions.\nAmbiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts.\nIt is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions. Also, it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, formula_1. Then, if one sees formula_2, there is no way to distinguish whether it means formula_1 multiplied by formula_4, or function formula_5 evaluated at argument equal to formula_4. In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning.\nCreators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities. Many algorithmic languages (C++ and Fortran) require the character * as symbol of multiplication. The Wolfram Language used in Mathematica allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions. Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function and variable; in particular, the expression f=f(x) is qualified as an error.\nThe order of operations may depend on the context. In most programming languages, the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right. Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example, formula_7 is interpreted as formula_8; in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language. In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity.\nIn the scientific journal style, one uses roman letters to denote elementary functions, whereas variables are written using italics.\nFor example, in mathematical journals the expression\nformula_9\ndoes not denote the sine function, but the \nproduct of the three variables\nformula_10,\nformula_11,\nformula_12, although in the informal notation of a slide presentation it may stand for formula_13.\nCommas in multi-component subscripts and superscripts are sometimes omitted; this is also potentially ambiguous notation.\nFor example, in the notation formula_14, the reader can only infer from the context whether it means a single-index object, taken with the subscript equal to product of variables formula_15, formula_12 and formula_17, or it is an indication to a trivalent tensor.\nSection::::Mathematical notation.:Examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions.\nAn expression such as formula_18 can be understood to mean either formula_19 or formula_20. Often the author's intention can be understood from the context, in cases where only one of the two makes sense, but an ambiguity like this should be avoided, for example by writing formula_21 or formula_22.\nThe expression formula_23 means formula_24 in several texts, though it might be thought to mean formula_25, since formula_26 commonly means formula_27. Conversely, formula_28 might seem to mean formula_29, as this exponentiation notation usually denotes function iteration: in general, formula_30 means formula_31. However, for trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, this notation conventionally means exponentiation of the result of function application.\nThe expression formula_32 can be interpreted as meaning formula_33, in particular if one thinks that the common acronym \"PEMDAS\" for the order of operations implies that M(ultiplication) takes precedence over D(ivision); however, it is more commonly understood to mean formula_34.\nSection::::Mathematical notation.:Notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics.\nIt is common to define the coherent states in quantum optics with formula_35 and states with fixed number of photons with formula_36. Then, there is an \"unwritten rule\": the state is coherent if there are more Greek characters than Latin characters in the argument, and formula_37photon state if the Latin characters dominate. The ambiguity becomes even worse, if formula_38 is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate, and formula_39 means the state with certain value of the momentum, which may be used in books on quantum mechanics. Such ambiguities easily lead to confusions, especially if some normalized adimensional, dimensionless variables are used. Expression formula_40 may mean a state with single photon, or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1, or state with momentum equal to unity, and so on. The reader is supposed to guess from the context.\nSection::::Mathematical notation.:Ambiguous terms in physics and mathematics.\nSome physical quantities do not yet have established notations; their value (and sometimes even dimension, as in the case of the Einstein coefficients), depends on the system of notations. Many terms are ambiguous. Each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition, suitable for a specific case. Just like Ludwig Wittgenstein states in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: \"... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning.\"\nA highly confusing term is \"gain\". For example, the sentence \"the gain of a system should be doubled\", without context, means close to nothing.\nIt may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled.\nIt may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled.\nIt may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system (assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state).\nThe term \"intensity\" is ambiguous when applied to light. The term can refer to any of irradiance, luminous intensity, radiant intensity, or radiance, depending on the background of the person using the term.\nAlso, confusions may be related with the use of atomic percent as measure of concentration of a dopant, or resolution of an imaging system, as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise. See also Accuracy and precision and its talk.\nThe Berry paradox arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as \"definable\" or \"nameable\". Terms of this kind give rise to vicious circle fallacies. Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal.\nSection::::Mathematical interpretation of ambiguity.\nIn mathematics and logic, ambiguity can be considered to be an instance of the logical concept of underdetermination\u2014for example, formula_41 leaves open what the value of \"X\" is\u2014while its opposite is a self-contradiction, also called inconsistency, paradoxicalness, or oxymoron, or in mathematics an"]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

TSP is known to be NP-Hard so an optimal solution for even a moderate size problem is difficult to solve. Instead, the greedy algorithm can be used to give a good but not optimal solution (it is an approximation to the optimal answer) in a reasonably short amount of time. The greedy algorithm heuristic says to pick whatever is currently the best next step regardless of whether that prevents (or even makes impossible) good steps later. It is a heuristic in that practice says it is a good enough solution, theory says there are better solutions (and even can tell how much better in some cases).\n\nAnother example of heuristic making an algorithm faster occurs in certain search problems. Initially, the heuristic tries every possibility at each step, like the full-space search algorithm. But it can stop the search at any time if the current possibility is already worse than the best solution already found. In such search problems, a heuristic can be used to try good choices first so that bad paths can be eliminated early (see alpha-beta pruning).

While this question remains open, recent years witnessed a plethora of breakthroughs related to approximating TSP solutions such as the first constant factor approximation for asymmetric TSP (ATSP) with triangle inequality by Svensson et al. [STV18] and an algorithm generalizing the 1.5-approximation to the more general path-TSP by Traub and Vygen [TV19] and Zenklusen [Zen19]. Another, perhaps even more classic, line of research is to solve TSP exactly as fast as possible in the worst case. Of course we do not expect to solve the problem in polynomial time since its decision variant is NP-complete, but nevertheless it is of interest to determine how fast it can be solved. This study was initiated already in the 1920\u2019s by Menger (see [Sch05] for an historial account). In 1962, Bellman [Bel62] and, independently, Held and Karp [ HK62] proposed a Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm with table entries defined for each subset of the vertices to build partial tours. We quote the following excerpt from the popular text book \u2018In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman\u2019 about this result: \u201cThis team\u2019s dynamic programming algorithm solves any instance in time proportial to \ud835\udc5b22\ud835\udc5b, and this is where we still stand, after nearly fifty years. A revolution may be overstating what is needed to push beyond Held-Karp, but it clearly is going to take an exciting new idea.\u201d \u2014 William Cook [Coo11] As also formalized in [Coo11], the research challenge can be more precisely stated as follows: Open Question 1: Can (A)TSP on \ud835\udc5b cities be solved in\ud835\udc42((2\u2212\ud835\udf00)\ud835\udc5b)time, for some constant\ud835\udf00 > 0? A positive answer to Open Question 1 would be valuable because of several reasons: First, generally speaking, \u2018improved algorithms\u2019 such as the one asked here would indicate that relatively simple approaches can be improved and thus that the computational landscape of worst-case complexity of NP-complete problems is even more complex than we may think. Second, such improved algorithms are highly relevant for the blooming area of Fine-Grained complexity, and better upper bounds are a source of inspiration for more breakthroughs."], "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/0": ["In 1962 Bellman, and independently Held and Karp, showed that TSP instances with \ud835\udc5b cities can be solved in \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc5b22\ud835\udc5b)time.

We also indicate how our methods may be useful to solve TSP in non-bipartite graphs. On a high level, our approach is via a new problem called Min-HamPair: Given two families of weighted perfect matchings, find a combination of minimum weight that forms a Hamiltonian cycle. As our main technical contribution, we give a fast algorithm for MinHamPair based on a new sparse cut-based factorization of the \u2018matchings connectivity matrix\u2019, introduced by Cygan et al.

Then the input can be represented with a (directed) graph in which we need to detect a Hamiltonian cycle. Thus, before attacking Open Question 1 we first need to detect Hamiltonian cycles faster than [Bel62, HK62]. Fortunately, in the last decade a beautiful line of algebraic algorithms was developed that led to spectacular progress and culminated in a breakthrough randomized algorithm by Bj\u00f6rklund [Bj\u00f614] (see also [BHKK17]) that detects Hamiltonian cycles in undirected graphs in \ud835\udc42(1.66^\ud835\udc5b) time. See also a survey by Koutis and Williams [KW16a]. Inspired by [Bj\u00f614], Cygan et al. [CNP+11] showed such an algebraic approach can be used to solve the Hamiltonicity problem fast on graphs of small \u2018treewidth\u2019. A follow-up work [CKN18] introduced the matchings connectivity matrix (see Section 2.2 for a definition), determined its rank, and used it to detect Hamiltonian cycles in graphs of small \u2018pathwidth\u2019 and bipartite directed graphs. On the positive side, these algorithms step out of the \u2018DP over subsets\u2019 mold of [Bel62, HK62] significantly. Especially the approach from [CNP+11, CKN18] is extremely flexible in how the solution is divided into sub-solutions, which make it the right approach in the case that the input graph has nice structure such as low treewidth. However, these algorithms are algebraic, which means they count certain candidate solutions and use the power of algebraic cancellation (i.e., subtraction or cancellation modulo 2) to filter out the actual solutions. Extending such algorithm to weighted problems such as TSP can be done by counting candidates of fixed weight, but this typically incurs pseudo-polynomial time overhead in the runtime. Avoiding such overhead is a significant research challenge that, for example, also underlies the well-known open problem of solving the All-Pairs-Shortest-Path problem in sub-cubic time (see e.g. [Wil18])."], "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/102": ["In this section we use the algorithm from Theorem 2 as a blackbox\nto find fast algorithms for TSP.

The NF operator can also be applied on an initial solution obtained by NN algorithm for further improvement in an elitist model, where only better solutions are accepted.\nThe bitonic tour of a set of points is the minimum-perimeter monotone polygon that has the points as its vertices; it can be computed efficiently by dynamic programming.\nAnother constructive heuristic, Match Twice and Stitch (MTS), performs two sequential matchings, where the second matching is executed after deleting all the edges of the first matching, to yield a set of cycles. The cycles are then stitched to produce the final tour.\n\nSection::::Computing a solution.:Heuristic and approximation algorithms.:Constructive heuristics.:Christofides algorithm.\nThe Christofides algorithm follows a similar outline but combines the minimum spanning tree with a solution of another problem, minimum-weight perfect matching. This gives a TSP tour which is at most 1.5 times the optimal. The Christofides algorithm was one of the first approximation algorithms, and was in part responsible for drawing attention to approximation algorithms as a practical approach to intractable problems. As a matter of fact, the term \"algorithm\" was not commonly extended to approximation algorithms until later; the Christofides algorithm was initially referred to as the Christofides heuristic.\nThis algorithm looks at things differently by using a result from graph theory which helps improve on the LB of the TSP which originated from doubling the cost of the minimum spanning tree. Given an Eulerian graph we can find an Eulerian tour in time. So if we had an Eulerian graph with cities from a TSP as vertices then we can easily see that we could use such a method for finding an Eulerian tour to find a TSP solution. By triangular inequality we know that the TSP tour can be no longer than the Eulerian tour and as such we have a LB for the TSP. Such a method is described below.\nBULLET::::1.

Instead, the greedy algorithm can be used to give a good but not optimal solution (it is an approximation to the optimal answer) in a reasonably short amount of time.

That is, all the facts (distances between each destination point) needed to determine the optimal path to follow are known with certainty and the goal is to run through the possible travel choices to come up with the one with the lowest total distance. However, let's assume that instead of wanting to minimize the total distance traveled to visit each desired destination, we wanted to minimize the total time needed to reach each destination. This goes beyond conventional optimization since travel time is inherently uncertain (traffic jams, time of day, etc.). As a result, to determine our optimal path we would want to use simulation - optimization to first understand the range of potential times it could take to go from one point to another (represented by a probability distribution in this case rather than a specific distance) and then optimize our travel decisions to identify the best path to follow taking that uncertainty into account.\nSection::::Stochastic methods.:Stochastic tunneling.\nStochastic tunneling (STUN) is an approach to global optimization based on the Monte Carlo method-sampling of the function to be objectively minimized in which the function is nonlinearly transformed to allow for easier tunneling among regions containing function minima.

The Lin--Kernighan heuristic is typically based on the computation of edges that have a `high probability' of being in the shortest tour, thereby effectively pruning the search space. Our new approach, instead, relies on a natural relaxation of the combinatorial optimization problem to the manifold of orthogonal matrices and the subsequent use of this solution to bias the Lin--Kernighan heuristic.

This study was initiated already in the 1920\u2019s by Menger (see [Sch05] for an historial account).

A Turing machine \"M\" is said to operate within time \"f\"(\"n\"), if the time required by \"M\" on each input of length \"n\" is at most \"f\"(\"n\"). A decision problem \"A\" can be solved in time \"f\"(\"n\") if there exists a Turing machine operating in time \"f\"(\"n\") that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the set of problems solvable within time \"f\"(\"n\") on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by DTIME(\"f\"(\"n\")).\n\nThe complexity of an algorithm is often expressed using big O notation.\n\nThe best, worst and average case complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity (or any other complexity measure) of different inputs of the same size. Since some inputs of size \"n\" may be faster to solve than others, we define the following complexities:\nBULLET::::1. Best-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the best input of size \"n\".\nBULLET::::2. Average-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem on an average. This complexity is only defined with respect to a probability distribution over the inputs. For instance, if all inputs of the same size are assumed to be equally likely to appear, the average case complexity can be defined with respect to the uniform distribution over all inputs of size \"n\".\nBULLET::::3. Amortized analysis: Amortized analysis considers both the costly and less costly operations together over the whole series of operations of the algorithm.\nBULLET::::4. Worst-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the worst input of size \"n\".\nThe order from cheap to costly is: Best, average (of discrete uniform distribution), amortized, worst.\n\nTo classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the maximum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem. The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst-case complexity, unless specified otherwise.\n\nThe phrase \"all possible algorithms\" includes not just the algorithms known today, but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future. To show a lower bound of \"T\"(\"n\") for a problem requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than \"T\"(\"n\").\n\nUpper and lower bounds are usually stated using the big O notation, which hides constant factors and smaller terms. This makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used.

However, this depends on the computer that is used, and the time is generally expressed as the number of needed elementary operations, which are supposed to take a constant time on a given computer, and to change by a constant factor when one changes of computer.\nThe study of the complexity of explicitly given algorithms is called analysis of algorithms, while the study of the complexity of problems is called computational complexity theory. Clearly, both areas are strongly related, as the complexity of an algorithm is always an upper bound of the complexity of the problem solved by this algorithm.\n...\nIt is generally difficult to compute precisely the worst-case and the average-case complexity. In addition, these exact values provide little practical application, as any change of computer or of model of computation would change the complexity somewhat.

Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size).

A simple example of an NP-hard problem is the subset sum problem.\nA more precise specification is: a problem \"H\" is NP-hard when every problem \"L\" in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to \"H\"; that is, assuming a solution for \"H\" takes 1 unit time, we can use \"H\"'s solution to solve \"L\" in polynomial time. As a consequence, finding a polynomial algorithm to solve any NP-hard problem would give polynomial algorithms for all the problems in NP, which is unlikely as many of them are considered difficult.\nA common misconception is that the \"NP\" in \"NP-hard\" stands for \"non-polynomial\" when in fact it stands for \"non-deterministic polynomial acceptable problems\". Although it is suspected that there are no polynomial-time algorithms for NP-hard problems, this has not been proven. Moreover, the class P, in which all problems can be solved in polynomial time, is contained in the NP class.\nSection::::Definition.\nA decision problem \"H\" is NP-hard when for every problem \"L\" in NP, there is a polynomial-time reduction from \"L\" to \"H\".\nAn equivalent definition is to require that every problem \"L\" in NP can be solved in polynomial time by an oracle machine with an oracle for \"H\".

Usually, this involves determining a function that relates the length of an algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its time complexity) or the number of storage locations it uses (its space complexity). An algorithm is said to be efficient when this function's values are small, or grow slowly compared to a growth in the size of the input. Different inputs of the same length may cause the algorithm to have different behavior, so best, worst and average case descriptions might all be of practical interest. When not otherwise specified, the function describing the performance of an algorithm is usually an upper bound, determined from the worst case inputs to the algorithm.\nThe term \"analysis of algorithms\" was coined by Donald Knuth. Algorithm analysis is an important part of a broader computational complexity theory, which provides theoretical estimates for the resources needed by any algorithm which solves a given computational problem. These estimates provide an insight into reasonable directions of search for efficient algorithms.\nIn theoretical analysis of algorithms it is common to estimate their complexity in the asymptotic sense, i.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. Big O notation, Big-omega notation and Big-theta notation are used to this end. For instance, binary search is said to run in a number of steps proportional to the logarithm of the length of the sorted list being searched, or in O(log(n)), colloquially \"in logarithmic time\". Usually asymptotic estimates are used because different implementations of the same algorithm may differ in efficiency. However the efficiencies of any two \"reasonable\" implementations of a given algorithm are related by a constant multiplicative factor called a \"hidden constant\".\nExact (not asymptotic) measures of efficiency can sometimes be computed but they usually require certain assumptions concerning the particular implementation of the algorithm, called model of computation. A model of computation may be defined in terms of an abstract computer, e.g., Turing machine, and/or by postulating that certain operations are executed in unit time.\nFor example, if the sorted list to which we apply binary search has \"n\" elements, and we can guarantee that each lookup of an element in the list can be done in unit time, then at most log \"n\" + 1 time units are needed to return an answer.\nSection::::Cost models.\nTime efficiency estimates depend on what we define to be a step. For the analysis to correspond usefully to the actual execution time, the time required to perform a step must be guaranteed to be bounded above by a constant. One must be careful here; for instance, some analyses count an addition of two numbers as one step. This assumption may not be warranted in certain contexts. For example, if the numbers involved in a computation may be arbitrarily large, the time required by a single addition can no longer be assumed to be constant.\nTwo cost models are generally used:\nBULLET::::- the uniform cost model, also called uniform-cost measurement (and similar variations), assigns a constant cost to every machine operation, regardless of the size of the numbers involved\nBULLET::::- the logarithmic cost model, also called logarithmic-cost measurement (and similar variations), assigns a cost to every machine operation proportional to the number of bits involved\nThe latter is more cumbersome to use, so it's only employed when necessary, for example in the analysis of arbitrary-precision arithmetic algorithms, like those used in cryptography.\nA key point which is often overlooked is that published lower bounds for problems are often given for a model of computation that is more restricted than the set of operations that you could use in practice and therefore there are algorithms that are faster than what would naively be thought possible.\nSection::::Run-time analysis.\nRun-time analysis is a theoretical classification that estimates and anticipates the increase in \"running time\" (or run-time) of an algorithm as its \"input size\" (usually denoted as \"n\") increases. Run-time efficiency is a topic of great interest in computer science: A program can take seconds, hours, or even years to finish executing, depending on which algorithm it implements. While software profiling techniques can be used to measure an algorithm's run-time in practice, they cannot provide timing data for all infinitely many possible inputs; the latter can only be achieved by the theoretical methods of run-time analysis.\nSection::::Run-time analysis.:Shortcomings of empirical metrics.\nSince algorithms are platform-independent (i.e. a given algorithm can be implemented in an arbitrary programming language on an arbitrary computer running an arbitrary operating system), there are additional significant drawbacks to using an empirical approach to gauge the comparative performance of a given set of algorithms.\nTake as an example a program that looks up a specific entry in a sorted list of size \"n\". Suppose this program were implemented on Computer A\", a state-of-the-art machine, using a linear search algorithm, and on Computer B\", a much slower machine, using a binary search algorithm. Benchmark testing on the two computers running their respective programs might look something like the following:\nBased on these metrics, it would be easy to jump to the conclusion that \"Computer A\" is running an algorithm that is far superior in efficiency to that of \"Computer B\". However, if the size of the input-list is increased to a sufficient number, that conclusion is dramatically demonstrated to be in error:\nComputer A, running the linear search program, exhibits a linear growth rate. The program's run-time is directly proportional to its input size. Doubling the input size doubles the run time, quadrupling the input size quadruples the run-time, and so forth. On the other hand, Computer B, running the binary search program, exhibits a logarithmic growth rate. Quadrupling the input size only increases the run time by a constant amount (in this example, 50,000 ns). Even though Computer A is ostensibly a faster machine, Computer B will inevitably surpass Computer A in run-time because it's running an algorithm with a much slower growth rate.\nSection::::Run-time analysis.:Orders of growth.\nInformally, an algorithm can be said to exhibit a growth rate on the order of a mathematical function if beyond a certain input size \"n\", the function times a positive constant provides an upper bound or limit for the run-time of that algorithm. In other words, for a given input size \"n\" greater than some \"n\" and a constant \"c\", the running time of that algorithm will never be larger than . This concept is frequently expressed using Big O notation. For example, since the run-time of insertion sort grows quadratically as its input size increases, insertion sort can be said to be of order \"O\"(\"n\").\nBig O notation is a convenient way to express the worst-case scenario for a given algorithm, although it can also be used to express the average-case \u2014 for example, the worst-case scenario for quicksort is \"O\"(\"n\"), but the average-case run-time is .\nSection::::Run-time analysis.:Empirical orders of growth.\nAssuming the execution time follows power rule, \"\", the coefficient \"a\" can be found by taking empirical measurements of run time formula_1 at some problem-size points formula_2, and calculating formula_3 so that formula_4. In other words, this measures the slope of the empirical line on the log\u2013log plot of execution time vs. problem size, at some size point. If the order of growth indeed follows the power rule (and so the line on log\u2013log plot is indeed a straight line), the empirical value of \"a\" will stay constant at different ranges, and if not, it will change (and the line is a curved line) - but still could serve for comparison of any two given algorithms as to their \"empirical local orders of growth\" behaviour. Applied to the above table:\nIt is clearly seen that the first algorithm exhibits a linear order of growth indeed following the power rule. The empirical values for the second one are diminishing rapidly, suggesting it follows another rule of growth and in any case has much lower local orders of growth (and improving further still), empirically, than the first one.\nSection::::Run-time analysis.:Evaluating run-time complexity.\nThe run-time complexity for the worst-case scenario of a given algorithm can sometimes be evaluated by examining the structure of the algorithm and making some simplifying assumptions. Consider the following pseudocode:\nA given computer will take a discrete amount of time to execute each of the instructions involved with carrying out this algorithm. The specific amount of time to carry out a given instruction will vary depending on which instruction is being executed and which computer is executing it, but on a conventional computer, this amount will be deterministic. Say that the actions carried out in step 1 are considered to consume time \"T\", step 2 uses time \"T\", and so forth.\nIn the algorithm above, steps 1, 2 and 7 will only be run once. For a worst-case evaluation, it should be assumed that step 3 will be run as well. Thus the total amount of time to run steps 1-3 and step 7 is:\nThe loops in steps 4, 5 and 6 are trickier to evaluate. The outer loop test in step 4 will execute ( \"n\" + 1 )\ntimes (note that an extra step is required to terminate the for loop, hence n + 1 and not n executions), which will consume \"T\"( \"n\" + 1 ) time. The inner loop, on the other hand, is governed by the value of j, which iter"]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. **Yes**  \n\n2. **Explanation**: arXiv contains many papers on computational complexity theory, algorithms, and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that explain these concepts.

More precisely, each input to the problem should be associated with a set of solutions of polynomial length, whose validity can be tested quickly (in polynomial time), such that the output for any input is \"yes\" if the solution set is non-empty and \"no\" if it is empty. The complexity class of problems of this form is called NP, an abbreviation for \"nondeterministic polynomial time\". A problem is said to be NP-hard if everything in NP can be transformed in polynomial time into it, and a problem is NP-complete if it is both in NP and NP-hard. The NP-complete problems represent the hardest problems in NP. If any NP-complete problem has a polynomial time algorithm, all problems in NP do. The set of NP-complete problems is often denoted by NP-C or NPC.\nAlthough a solution to an NP-complete problem can be \"verified\" \"quickly\", there is no known way to \"find\" a solution quickly. That is, the time required to solve the problem using any currently known algorithm increases rapidly as the size of the problem grows. As a consequence, determining whether it is possible to solve these problems quickly, called the P versus NP problem, is one of the fundamental unsolved problems in computer science today.\nWhile a method for computing the solutions to NP-complete problems quickly remains undiscovered, computer scientists and programmers still frequently encounter NP-complete problems. NP-complete problems are often addressed by using heuristic methods and approximation algorithms.\n\nSection::::Formal definition.\nA decision problem formula_1 is NP-complete if:\nBULLET::::1. formula_1 is in NP, and\nBULLET::::2.

Therefore, it is useful to know a variety of NP-complete problems. The list below contains some well-known problems that are NP-complete when expressed as decision problems.\nBULLET::::- Travelling salesman problem (decision version)"], "wikipedia-21562": ["NP (complexity)\nIn computational complexity theory, NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) is a complexity class used to classify decision problems. NP is the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, where the answer is \"yes\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time.\nAn equivalent definition of NP is the set of decision problems \"solvable\" in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine. This definition is the basis for the abbreviation NP; \"nondeterministic, polynomial time.\" These two definitions are equivalent because the algorithm based on the Turing machine consists of two phases, the first of which consists of a guess about the solution, which is generated in a non-deterministic way, while the second phase consists of a deterministic algorithm that verifies if the guess is a solution to the problem.\nDecision problems are assigned complexity classes (such as NP) based on the fastest known algorithms. Therefore, decision problems may change classes if faster algorithms are discovered.\nIt is easy to see that the complexity class P (all problems solvable, deterministically, in polynomial time) is contained in NP (problems where solutions can be verified in polynomial time), because if a problem is solvable in polynomial time then a solution is also verifiable in polynomial time by simply solving the problem. But NP contains many more problems, the hardest of which are called NP-complete problems. An algorithm solving such a problem in polynomial time is also able to solve any other NP problem in polynomial time. The most important P versus NP (\u201cP = NP?\u201d) problem, asks whether polynomial time algorithms exist for solving NP-complete, and by corollary, all NP problems. It is widely believed that this is not the case.\nThe complexity class NP is related to the complexity class if co-NP for which the answer \"no\" can be verified in polynomial time. Whether or not NP = co-NP is another outstanding question in complexity theory.\nSection::::Formal definition.\nThe complexity class NP can be defined in terms of NTIME as follows:\nwhere formula_2 is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a non-deterministic Turing machine in formula_3 time.\nAlternatively, NP can be defined using deterministic Turing machines as verifiers. A language \"L\" is in NP if and only if there exist polynomials \"p\" and \"q\", and a deterministic Turing machine \"M\", such that\nBULLET::::- For all \"x\" and \"y\", the machine \"M\" runs in time \"p\"(|\"x\"|\")\" on input\nBULLET::::- For all \"x\" in \"L\", there exists a string \"y\" of length \"q\"(|\"x\"|) such that\nBULLET::::- For all \"x\" not in \"L\" and all strings \"y\" of length \"q\"(|\"x\"|),\nSection::::Background.\nMany computer science problems are contained in NP, like decision versions of many search and optimization problems.\nSection::::Background.:Verifier-based definition.\nIn order to explain the verifier-based definition of NP, consider the subset sum problem:\nAssume that we are given some integers, {\u22127, \u22123, \u22122, 5, 8}, and we wish to know whether some of these integers sum up to zero. Here, the answer is \"yes\", since the integers {\u22123, \u22122, 5} corresponds to the sum The task of deciding whether such a subset with zero sum exists is called the \"subset sum problem\".\nTo answer if some of the integers add to zero we can create an algorithm which obtains all the possible subsets. As the number of integers that we feed into the algorithm becomes larger, both the number of subsets and the computation time grows exponentially. \nBut notice that if we are given a particular subset we can \"efficiently verify\" whether the subset sum is zero, by summing the integers of the subset. If the sum is zero, that subset is a \"proof\" or witness for the answer is \"yes\". An algorithm that verifies whether a given subset has sum zero is a \"verifier\". Clearly, summing the integers of a subset can be done in polynomial time and the subset sum problem is therefore in NP.\nThe above example can be generalized for any decision problem. Given any instance I of problem P and witness W, if there exists a \"verifier\" V so that given the ordered pair (I, W) as input, V returns \"yes\" in polynomial time if the witness proves that the answer is \"yes\" and \"no\" in polynomial time otherwise, then P is in NP.\nThe \"no\"-answer version of this problem is stated as: \"given a finite set of integers, does every non-empty subset have a nonzero sum?\". The verifier-based definition of NP does \"not\" require an efficient verifier for the \"no\"-answers. The class of problems with such verifiers for the \"no\"-answers is called co-NP. In fact, it is an open question whether all problems in NP also have verifiers for the \"no\"-answers and thus are in co-NP.\nIn some literature the verifier is called the \"certifier\" and the witness the \"certificate\".\nSection::::Background.:Machine-definition.\nEquivalent to the verifier-based definition is the following characterization: NP is the class of decision problems solvable by a non-deterministic Turing machine that runs in polynomial time. That is to say, \"P\" is in NP whenever \"P\" is recognized by some polynomial-time non-deterministic Turing machine \"M\" with an existential acceptance condition, meaning that \"w \u2208 P\" if and only if some computation path of \"M(w)\" leads to an accepting state. This definition is equivalent to the verifier-based definition because a non-deterministic Turing machine could solve an NP problem in polynomial time by non-deterministically selecting a certificate and running the verifier on the certificate. Similarly, if such a machine exists, then a polynomial time verifier can naturally be constructed from it.\nIn this light, we can define co-NP dually as the class of decision problems \"P\" recognizable by polynomial-time non-deterministic Turing machines with an existential rejection condition. Since an existential rejection condition is exactly the same thing as an universal acceptance condition, we can understand the \"NP vs. co-NP\" question as asking whether the existential and universal acceptance conditions have the same expressive power for the class of polynomial-time non-deterministic Turing machines.\nSection::::Properties.\nNP is closed under union, intersection, concatenation, Kleene star and reversal. It is not known whether NP is closed under complement (this question is the so-called \"NP versus co-NP\" question)\nSection::::Why some NP problems are hard to solve.\nBecause of the many important problems in this class, there have been extensive efforts to find polynomial-time algorithms for problems in NP. However, there remain a large number of problems in NP that defy such attempts, seeming to require super-polynomial time. Whether these problems are not decidable in polynomial time is one of the greatest open questions in computer science (see P versus NP (\"P=NP\") problem for an in-depth discussion).\nAn important notion in this context is the set of NP-complete decision problems, which is a subset of NP and might be informally described as the \"hardest\" problems in NP. If there is a polynomial-time algorithm for even \"one\" of them, then there is a polynomial-time algorithm for \"all\" the problems in NP. Because of this, and because dedicated research has failed to find a polynomial algorithm for any NP-complete problem, once a problem has been proven to be NP-complete this is widely regarded as a sign that a polynomial algorithm for this problem is unlikely to exist.\nHowever, in practical uses, instead of spending computational resources looking for an optimal solution, a good enough (but potentially suboptimal) solution may often be found in polynomial time. Also, the real life applications of some problems are easier than their theoretical equivalents.\nSection::::Equivalence of definitions.\nThe two definitions of NP as the class of problems solvable by a nondeterministic Turing machine (TM) in polynomial time and the class of problems verifiable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time are equivalent. The proof is described by many textbooks, for example Sipser's \"Introduction to the Theory of Computation\", section 7.3.\nTo show this, first suppose we have a deterministic verifier. A nondeterministic machine can simply nondeterministically run the verifier on all possible proof strings (this requires only polynomially many steps because it can nondeterministically choose the next character in the proof string in each step, and the length of the proof string must be polynomially bounded). If any proof is valid, some path will accept; if no proof is valid, the string is not in the language and it will reject.\nConversely, suppose we have a nondeterministic TM called A accepting a given language L. At each of its polynomially many steps, the machine's computation tree branches in at most a finite number of directions. There must be at least one accepting path, and the string describing this path is"]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

This is commonly known as the traveling salesman problem.\nThere are decision problems that are \"NP-hard\" but not \"NP-complete\", for example the halting problem. This is the problem which asks \"given a program and its input, will it run forever?\" That is a \"yes\"/\"no\" question, so this is a decision problem. It is easy to prove that the halting problem is NP-hard but not NP-complete. For example, the Boolean satisfiability problem can be reduced to the halting problem by transforming it to the description of a Turing machine that tries all truth value assignments and when it finds one that satisfies the formula it halts and otherwise it goes into an infinite loop. It is also easy to see that the halting problem is not in \"NP\" since all problems in NP are decidable in a finite number of operations, while the halting problem, in general, is undecidable. There are also NP-hard problems that are neither \"NP-complete\" nor \"Undecidable\". For instance, the language of True quantified Boolean formulas is decidable in polynomial space, but not in non-deterministic polynomial time (unless NP = PSPACE).\nSection::::NP-naming convention.\nNP-hard problems do not have to be elements of the complexity class NP.\nAs NP plays a central role in computational complexity, it is used as the basis of several classes:\nBULLET::::- NP: Class of computational decision problems for which a given \"yes\"-solution can be verified as a solution in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine (or \"solvable\" by a \"non-deterministic\" Turing machine in polynomial time).\nBULLET::::- NP-hard: Class of problems which are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. Problems that are NP-hard do not have to be elements of NP; indeed, they may not even be decidable.\nBULLET::::- NP-complete: Class of decision problems which contains the hardest problems in NP. Each NP-complete problem has to be in NP.\nBULLET::::- NP-easy: At most as hard as NP, but not necessarily in NP.\nBULLET::::- NP-equivalent: Decision problems that are both NP-hard and NP-easy, but not necessarily in NP.\nBULLET::::- NP-intermediate: If P and NP are different, then there exist decision problems in the region of NP that fall between P and the NP-complete problems. (If P and NP are the same class, then NP-intermediate problems do not exist because in this case every NP-complete problem would fall in P, and by definition, every problem in NP can be reduced to an NP-complete problem.)\nSection::::Application areas.\nNP-hard problems are often tackled with rules-based languages in areas including:\nBULLET::::- Approximate computing\nBULLET::::- Configuration\nBULLET::::- Cryptography\nBULLET::::- Data mining\nBULLET::::- Decision support\nBULLET::::- Phylogenetics\nBULLET::::- Planning\nBULLET::::- Process monitoring and control\nBULLET::::- Rosters or schedules\nBULLET::::- Routing/vehicle routing\nBULLET::::- Scheduling"], "wikipedia-31248": ["The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: \"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?\" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science.\n\nIn the theory of computational complexity, the decision version of the TSP (where, given a length \"L\", the task is to decide whether the graph has any tour shorter than \"L\") belongs to the class of NP-complete problems. Thus, it is possible that the worst-case running time for any algorithm for the TSP increases superpolynomially (but no more than exponentially) with the number of cities.\n\nRichard M.

However, generic search algorithms are not guaranteed to find an optimal solution, nor are they guaranteed to run quickly (in polynomial time).

The set of NP-complete problems is often denoted by NP-C or NPC.\nAlthough a solution to an NP-complete problem can be \"verified\" \"quickly\", there is no known way to \"find\" a solution quickly. That is, the time required to solve the problem using any currently known algorithm increases rapidly as the size of the problem grows. As a consequence, determining whether it is possible to solve these problems quickly, called the P versus NP problem, is one of the fundamental unsolved problems in computer science today.\nWhile a method for computing the solutions to NP-complete problems quickly remains undiscovered, computer scientists and programmers still frequently encounter NP-complete problems. NP-complete problems are often addressed by using heuristic methods and approximation algorithms.\nBULLET::::- Travelling salesman problem (decision version)"], "wikipedia-6115": ["The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science. It asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (technically, verified in polynomial time) can also be solved quickly (again, in polynomial time).\nThe informal term \"quickly\", used above, means the existence of an algorithm solving the task that runs in polynomial time, such that the time to complete the task varies as a polynomial function on the size of the input to the algorithm (as opposed to, say, exponential time). The general class of questions for which some algorithm can provide an answer in polynomial time is called \"class P\" or just \"P\". For some questions, there is no known way to find an answer quickly, but if one is provided with information showing what the answer is, it is possible to verify the answer quickly. The class of questions for which an answer can be \"verified\" in polynomial time is called NP, which stands for \"nondeterministic polynomial time\".\nAn answer to the P\u00a0=\u00a0NP question would determine whether problems that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. If it turned out that P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP, it would mean that there are problems in NP that are harder to compute than to verify: they could not be solved in polynomial time, but the answer could be verified in polynomial time.\nNP-hard problems are those at least as hard as NP problems, i.e., all NP problems can be reduced (in polynomial time) to them.

NP is the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, where the answer is \"yes\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time.\nAn equivalent definition of NP is the set of decision problems \"solvable\" in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine. This definition is the basis for the abbreviation NP; \"nondeterministic, polynomial time.\" These two definitions are equivalent because the algorithm based on the Turing machine consists of two phases, the first of which consists of a guess about the solution, which is generated in a non-deterministic way, while the second phase consists of a deterministic algorithm that verifies if the guess is a solution to the problem.\nDecision problems are assigned complexity classes (such as NP) based on the fastest known algorithms. Therefore, decision problems may change classes if faster algorithms are discovered.\nIt is easy to see that the complexity class P (all problems solvable, deterministically, in polynomial time) is contained in NP (problems where solutions can be verified in polynomial time), because if a problem is solvable in polynomial time then a solution is also verifiable in polynomial time by simply solving the problem. But NP contains many more problems, the hardest of which are called NP-complete problems. An algorithm solving such a problem in polynomial time is also able to solve any other NP problem in polynomial time. The most important P versus NP (\u201cP = NP?\u201d) problem, asks whether polynomial time algorithms exist for solving NP-complete, and by corollary, all NP problems.

Whether or not NP = co-NP is another outstanding question in complexity theory."], "wikipedia-405944": ["In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to differ by at most a constant factor.\nSince an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input. Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases\u2014that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity. Therefore, the time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation, typically formula_1\nformula_2 formula_3 formula_4 etc., where is the input size in units of bits needed to represent the input.\nAlgorithmic complexities are classified according to the type of function appearing in the big O notation.

This model is related to the distribution one, as we can consider the objects inside every box as subsets of the set of objects to distribute. So, each of the 24 distributions described previously has a matching kind of partition into subsets. So, a partition problem can be solved by transforming it into a distribution one and applying the correspondent operation provided by the distribution model (previous table). Following this method, we will get the number of possible ways of dividing the set. The relation between these two models is described in the following table:\nThis relation let us transform the table provided by the distribution model into a new one that can be used to know the different ways of dividing a set of \"k\" elements into \"n\" subsets:"], "wikipedia-5170": ["Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and an end in obtaining results, and certain properties of finite structures.

For the equation, the paper may clarify its purpose (e.g., counting paths, distances), while \"HC\" is standard terminology in graph theory.", "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/94": ["1, if \ud835\udc34\u222a\ud835\udc35is an Hamiltonian Cycle ,\n0, otherwise."], "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/6": ["An important case of (A)TSP is the case where all weights are either 0 or \u221e. Then the input can be represented with a (directed) graph in which we need to detect a Hamiltonian cycle. Thus, before attacking Open Question 1 we first need to detect Hamiltonian cycles faster than [Bel62, HK62]. Fortunately, in the last decade a beautiful line of algebraic algorithms was developed that led to spectacular progress and culminated in a breakthrough randomized algorithm by Bj\u00f6rklund [Bj\u00f614] (see also [BHKK17]) that detects Hamiltonian cycles in undirected graphs in \ud835\udc42(1.66^\ud835\udc5b) time. See also a survey by Koutis and Williams [KW16a]. Inspired by [Bj\u00f614], Cygan et al. [CNP+11] showed such an algebraic approach can be used to solve the Hamiltonicity problem fast on graphs of small \u2018treewidth\u2019. A follow-up work [CKN18] introduced the matchings connectivity matrix (see Section 2.2 for a definition), determined its rank, and used it to detect Hamiltonian cycles in graphs of small \u2018pathwidth\u2019 and bipartite directed graphs."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-222434": 1, "wikipedia-44027": 1, "wikipedia-38075487": 1, "wikipedia-1482326": 1, "wikipedia-3983826": 1, "wikipedia-44098050": 1, "wikipedia-3739933": 1, "wikipedia-19590493": 1, "wikipedia-37376713": 1, "wikipedia-58552301": 1, "arxiv-2105.11429": 1, "arxiv-2104.02119": 1, "arxiv-2004.01654": 1, "arxiv-1501.04270": 1, "arxiv-math/0610539": 1, "arxiv-2011.01886": 1, "arxiv-1207.5643": 1, "arxiv-2404.11547": 1, "arxiv-math/9612224": 1, "arxiv-2007.06453": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/48": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/47": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/75": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/86": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/41": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/91": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/40": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/94": 2, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/6": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/81": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-222434": 1, "wikipedia-44027": 1, "wikipedia-38075487": 1, "wikipedia-1482326": 1, "wikipedia-3983826": 1, "wikipedia-44098050": 1, "wikipedia-3739933": 1, "wikipedia-19590493": 1, "wikipedia-37376713": 1, "wikipedia-58552301": 1, "arxiv-2105.11429": 1, "arxiv-2104.02119": 1, "arxiv-2004.01654": 1, "arxiv-1501.04270": 1, "arxiv-math/0610539": 1, "arxiv-2011.01886": 1, "arxiv-1207.5643": 1, "arxiv-2404.11547": 1, "arxiv-math/9612224": 1, "arxiv-2007.06453": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/48": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/47": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/75": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/86": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/41": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/91": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/40": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/94": 3, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/6": 2, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/81": 1}}}

Therefore, we can describe the state (i.e. empty, half or full) of each group with \ud835\udc50 and two integer partitions \ud835\udc521 +\ud835\udc522 +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+ \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50/2+1 = \ud835\udc52 and \ud835\udc531 +\ud835\udc532 +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+ \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc50/2+1 = \ud835\udc53 into non-negative integers where \ud835\udc52 = (\ud835\udc61 \u2212\ud835\udc58 \u2212\ud835\udc50)/2 is the total number of empty groups and \ud835\udc53 = (\ud835\udc58\u2212\ud835\udc50)/2 is the total number of full groups. Note that for both the empty and full groups we have at most \ud835\udc50/2 alternatives on which of two consecutive half groups we place them. It is well known that the number of integer partitions \ud835\udc4e1 +... + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udc4e into non-negative integers can be injectively encoded as a subset \ud835\udc34 \u2286 \ud835\udc4e+\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58. Thus we can encode \ud835\udc521,...,\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50/2+1 as \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52 and \ud835\udc531,...,\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc50/2+1 as \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc53. This uniquely determines which group is empty, half and full, and it only remains to describe of each half group which vertex is in and which one is not.

It does so by running a fairly straightforward dynamic programming algorithm that (roughly speaking) stores for every matching on a separator the minimum weight of a partial solution (i.e. a set of paths) that connects the vertices on the separator as dictated by the matching. Since there are \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc58) matchings on \ud835\udc58 vertices and a separator can be as large pw this implies a pw\ud835\udc42(pw)\ud835\udc5b time algorithm. To obtain the 2\ud835\udc42(pw)\ud835\udc5b run time, the rank-based method uses a reducematchings subroutine that employs Gaussian elimination to reduce the number of matchings to only 2\ud835\udc42(pw) that are representative for all matchings (see Definition 2.11). An important fact to note is that this Gaussian elimination step is a major bottleneck for the algorithm.

As graphical analog calculators, slide rules are closely related to nomograms, but the former are used for general calculations, whereas the latter are used for application-specific computations.\nThe slide rule is used primarily for multiplication and division, and also for functions such as exponents, roots, logarithms, and trigonometry, but typically not for addition or subtraction. Though similar in name and appearance to a standard ruler, the slide rule is not meant to be used for measuring length or drawing straight lines.\nSlide rules exist in a diverse range of styles and generally appear in a linear or circular form with a standardized set of markings (scales) essential to performing mathematical computations. Slide rules manufactured for specialized fields such as aviation or finance typically feature additional scales that aid in calculations particular to those fields.\nAt its simplest, each number to be multiplied is represented by a length on a sliding ruler. As the rulers each have a logarithmic scale, it is possible to align them to read the sum of the logarithms, and hence calculate the product of the two numbers.\nThe Reverend William Oughtred and others developed the slide rule in the 17th century based on the emerging work on logarithms by John Napier. Before the advent of the electronic calculator, it was the most commonly used calculation tool in science and engineering. The use of slide rules continued to grow through the 1950s and 1960s even as computers were being gradually introduced; but around 1974 the handheld electronic scientific calculator made them largely obsolete and most suppliers left the business.\nSection::::Basic concepts.\nIn its most basic form, the slide rule uses two logarithmic scales to allow rapid multiplication and division of numbers. These common operations can be time-consuming and error-prone when done on paper. More elaborate slide rules allow other calculations, such as square roots, exponentials, logarithms, and trigonometric functions.\nScales may be grouped in decades, which are numbers ranging from 1 to 10 (i.e. 10 to 10). Thus single decade scales C and D range from 1 to 10 across the entire width of the slide rule while double decade scales A and B range from 1 to 100 over the width of the slide rule.\nIn general, mathematical calculations are performed by aligning a mark on the sliding central strip with a mark on one of the fixed strips, and then observing the relative positions of other marks on the strips. Numbers aligned with the marks give the approximate value of the product, quotient, or other calculated result.\nThe user determines the location of the decimal point in the result, based on mental estimation. Scientific notation is used to track the decimal point in more formal calculations. Addition and subtraction steps in a calculation are generally done mentally or on paper, not on the slide rule.\nMost slide rules consist of three linear strips of the same length, aligned in parallel and interlocked so that the central strip can be moved lengthwise relative to the other two. The outer two strips are fixed so that their relative positions do not change.\nSome slide rules (\"duplex\" models) have scales on both sides of the rule and slide strip, others on one side of the outer strips and both sides of the slide strip (which can usually be pulled out, flipped over and reinserted for convenience), still others on one side only (\"simplex\" rules). A sliding with a vertical alignment line is used to find corresponding points on scales that are not adjacent to each other or, in duplex models, are on the other side of the rule. The cursor can also record an intermediate result on any of the scales."], "wikipedia-313845": ["The original motivation of formal concept analysis was the search for real-world meaning of mathematical order theory. One such possibility of very general nature is that data tables can be transformed into algebraic structures called \"complete lattices\", and that these can be utilized for data visualization and interpretation. A data table that represents a heterogeneous relation between objects and attributes, tabulating pairs of the form \"object \"g\" has attribute \"m\"\", is considered as a basic data type. It is referred to as a \"formal context\". In this theory, a \"formal concept\" is defined to be a pair (\"A\", \"B\"), where \"A\" is a set of objects (called the \"extent\") and \"B\" is a set of attributes (the \"intent\") such that\nBULLET::::- the extent \"A\" consists of all objects that share the attributes in \"B\", and dually\nBULLET::::- the intent \"B\" consists of all attributes shared by the objects in \"A\".\nIn this way, formal concept analysis formalizes the semantic notions of extension and intension.\nThe formal concepts of any formal context can\u2014as explained below\u2014be ordered in a hierarchy called more formally the context's \"concept lattice.\" The concept lattice can be graphically visualized as a \"line diagram\", which then may be helpful for understanding the data. Often however these lattices get too large for visualization. Then the mathematical theory of formal concept analysis may be helpful, e.g., for decomposing the lattice into smaller pieces without information loss, or for embedding it into another structure which is easier to interpret."], "wikipedia-61701": ["Venn diagrams were conceived around 1880 by John Venn. They are used to teach elementary set theory, as well as illustrate simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, linguistics, and computer science.\nA Venn diagram in which the area of each shape is proportional to the number of elements it contains is called an area-proportional or scaled Venn diagram.\nSection::::Example.\nThis example involves two sets, A and B, represented here as coloured circles. The orange circle, set A, represents all living creatures that are two-legged. The blue circle, set B, represents the living creatures that can fly. Each separate type of creature can be imagined as a point somewhere in the diagram. Living creatures that both can fly \"and\" have two legs\u2014for example, parrots\u2014are then in both sets, so they correspond to points in the region where the blue and orange circles overlap. It is important to note that this overlapping region would only contain those elements (in this example creatures) that are members of both set A (two-legged creatures) and are also members of set B (flying creatures.)\nHumans and penguins are bipedal, and so are then in the orange circle, but since they cannot fly they appear in the left part of the orange circle, where it does not overlap with the blue circle. Mosquitoes have six legs, and fly, so the point for mosquitoes is in the part of the blue circle that does not overlap with the orange one.

Finding a Hamiltonian cycle given a large graph is believed to be computationally infeasible, since its corresponding decision version is known to be NP-complete. Peggy will prove that she knows the cycle without simply revealing it (perhaps Victor is interested in buying it but wants verification first, or maybe Peggy is the only one who knows this information and is proving her identity to Victor).\nTo show that Peggy knows this Hamiltonian cycle, she and Victor play several rounds of a game.\nBULLET::::- At the beginning of each round, Peggy creates \"H\", a graph which is isomorphic to \"G\" (i.e. \"H\" is just like \"G\" except that all the vertices have different names). Since it is trivial to translate a Hamiltonian cycle between isomorphic graphs with known isomorphism, if Peggy knows a Hamiltonian cycle for \"G\" she also must know one for \"H\".\nBULLET::::- Peggy commits to \"H\". She could do so by using a cryptographic commitment scheme. Alternatively, she could number the vertices of \"H\", then for each edge of \"H\" write on a small piece of paper containing the two vertices of the edge and then put these pieces of paper face down on a table. The purpose of this commitment is that Peggy is not able to change \"H\" while at the same time Victor has no information about \"H\".\nBULLET::::- Victor then randomly chooses one of two questions to ask Peggy. He can either ask her to show the isomorphism between \"H\" and \"G\" (see graph isomorphism problem), or he can ask her to show a Hamiltonian cycle in \"H\".\nBULLET::::- If Peggy is asked to show that the two graphs are isomorphic, she first uncovers all of \"H\" (e.g. by turning over all pieces of papers that she put on the table) and then provides the vertex translations that map \"G\" to \"H\". Victor can verify that they are indeed isomorphic.\nBULLET::::- If Peggy is asked to prove that she knows a Hamiltonian cycle in \"H\", she translates her Hamiltonian cycle in \"G\" onto \"H\" and only uncovers the edges on the Hamiltonian cycle.

By selecting every other edge again in these cycles, one obtains a perfect matching in linear time.

Since row operations are left-multiplications and column operations are right-multiplications, this preserves the invariant formula_16 where formula_17 denote current values and \"A\" denotes the original matrix; eventually the matrices in this invariant become diagonal. Only invertible row and column operations are performed, which ensures that \"S\" and \"T\" remain invertible matrices.\nFor \"a\" in \"R\" \\ {0}, write \u03b4(\"a\") for the number of prime factors of \"a\" (these exist and are unique since any PID is also a unique factorization domain).

This new entry \u03b2 divides the entry formula_31 that was there before, and so in particular formula_32; therefore repeating these steps must eventually terminate. One ends up with a matrix having an entry at position (\"t\",\"j\") that divides all entries in column \"j\".\nSection::::Algorithm.:Step III: Eliminating entries.\nFinally, adding appropriate multiples of row \"t\", it can be achieved that all entries in column \"j\" except for that at position (\"t\",\"j\") are zero. This can be achieved by left-multiplication with an appropriate matrix. However, to make the matrix fully diagonal we need to eliminate nonzero entries on the row of position (\"t\",\"j\") as well. This can be achieved by repeating the steps in Step II for columns instead of rows, and using multiplication on the right by the transpose of the obtained matrix \"L\". In general this will result in the zero entries from the prior application of Step III becoming nonzero again.\nHowever, notice that each application of Step II for either rows or columns must continue to reduce the value of formula_33, and so the process must eventually stop after some number of iterations, leading to a matrix where the entry at position (\"t\",\"j\") is the only non-zero entry in both its row and column.\nAt this point, only the block of \"A\" to the lower right of (\"t\",\"j\") needs to be diagonalized, and conceptually the algorithm can be applied recursively, treating this block as a separate matrix. In other words, we can increment \"t\" by one and go back to Step I.\nSection::::Algorithm.:Final step.\nApplying the steps described above to the remaining non-zero columns of the resulting matrix (if any), we get an formula_34-matrix with column indices formula_35 where formula_36. The matrix entries formula_37 are non-zero, and every other entry is zero.\nNow we can move the null columns of this matrix to the right, so that the nonzero entries are on positions formula_38 for formula_39. For short, set formula_4 for the element at position formula_38.\nThe condition of divisibility of diagonal entries might not be satisfied. For any index formula_42 for which formula_43, one can repair this shortcoming by operations on rows and columns formula_44 and formula_45 only: first add column formula_45 to column formula_44 to get an entry formula_48 in column \"i\" without disturbing the entry formula_4 at position formula_38, and then apply a row operation to make the entry at position formula_38 equal to formula_52 as in Step\u00a0II; finally proceed as in Step\u00a0III to make the matrix diagonal again. Since the new entry at position formula_53 is a linear combination of the original formula_54, it is divisible by \u03b2.\nThe value formula_55 does not change by the above operation (it is \u03b4 of the determinant of the upper formula_56 submatrix), whence that operation does diminish (by moving prime factors to the right) the value of\nSo after finitely many applications of this operation no further application is possible, which means that we have obtained formula_58 as desired.\nSince all row and column manipulations involved in the process are invertible, this shows that there exist invertible formula_1 and formula_2-matrices \"S, T\" so that the product \"S A T\" satisfies the definition of a Smith normal form. In particular, this shows that the Smith normal form exists, which was assumed without proof in the definition."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

Increasing the number of latent factor will improve personalization, therefore recommendation quality, until the number of factors becomes too high, at which point the model starts to overfit and the recommendation quality will decrease.

Finding a Hamiltonian cycle given a large graph is believed to be computationally infeasible, since its corresponding decision version is known to be NP-complete.

Since it is trivial to translate a Hamiltonian cycle between isomorphic graphs with known isomorphism, if Peggy knows a Hamiltonian cycle for \"G\" she also must know one for \"H\".\nBULLET::::- Peggy commits to \"H\".

The result of the integration is then another stochastic process. Concretely, the integral from 0 to any particular \"t\" is a random variable, defined as a limit of a certain sequence of random variables. The paths of Brownian motion fail to satisfy the requirements to be able to apply the standard techniques of calculus. So with the integrand a stochastic process, the It\u00f4 stochastic integral amounts to an integral with respect to a function which is not differentiable at any point and has infinite variation over every time interval. \nThe main insight is that the integral can be defined as long as the integrand \"H\" is adapted, which loosely speaking means that its value at time \"t\" can only depend on information available up until this time. Roughly speaking, one chooses a sequence of partitions of the interval from 0 to \"t\" and construct Riemann sums. Every time we are computing a Riemann sum, we are using a particular instantiation of the integrator. It is crucial which point in each of the small intervals is used to compute the value of the function. The limit then is taken in probability as the mesh of the partition is going to zero. Numerous technical details have to be taken care of to show that this limit exists and is independent of the particular sequence of partitions. Typically, the left end of the interval is used.\nIn mathematical finance, the described evaluation strategy of the integral is conceptualized as that we are first deciding what to do, then observing the change in the prices. The integrand is how much stock we hold, the integrator represents the movement of the prices, and the integral is how much money we have in total including what our stock is worth, at any given moment. The prices of stocks and other traded financial assets can be modeled by stochastic processes such as Brownian motion or, more often, geometric Brownian motion (see Black\u2013Scholes). Then, the It\u00f4 stochastic integral represents the payoff of a continuous-time trading strategy consisting of holding an amount \"H\" of the stock at time \"t\". In this situation, the condition that \"H\" is adapted corresponds to the necessary restriction that the trading strategy can only make use of the available information at any time. This prevents the possibility of unlimited gains through high-frequency trading: buying the stock just before each uptick in the market and selling before each downtick. Similarly, the condition that \"H\" is adapted implies that the stochastic integral will not diverge when calculated as a limit of Riemann sums ."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

The co-stardom network can also be represented by a bipartite graph where nodes are of two types: actors and movies. And edges connect different types of nodes (i.e. actors to movies) if they have a relationship (actors in a movie). According to (Newman, Strogatz, and Watts, 2001), the movie actor network can be described by a bipartite graph. Nodes in this graph are of two types: movies and actors.

The heart of a topological representation of a network is the graph of the network. Elements are represented as the edges of the graph. An edge is drawn as a line, terminating on dots or small circles from which other edges (elements) may emanate. In circuit analysis, the edges of the graph are called \"branches\". The dots are called the vertices of the graph and represent the nodes of the network. \"Node\" and \"vertex\" are terms that can be used interchangeably when discussing graphs of networks. Figure 2.2 shows a graph representation of the circuit in figure 2.1.\n\nGraphs used in network analysis are usually, in addition, both directed graphs, to capture the direction of current flow and voltage, and labelled graphs, to capture the uniqueness of the branches and nodes. For instance, a graph consisting of a square of branches would still be the same topological graph if two branches were interchanged unless the branches were uniquely labelled. In directed graphs, the two nodes that a branch connects to are designated the source and target nodes. Typically, these will be indicated by an arrow drawn on the branch.\n\nIncidence is one of the basic properties of a graph. An edge that is connected to a vertex is said to be \"incident\" on that vertex. The incidence of a graph can be captured in matrix format with a matrix called an incidence matrix. In fact, the incidence matrix is an alternative mathematical representation of the graph which dispenses with the need for any kind of drawing. Matrix rows correspond to nodes and matrix columns correspond to branches. The elements of the matrix are either zero, for no incidence, or one, for incidence between the node and branch. Direction in directed graphs is indicated by the sign of the element."], "wikipedia-992525": ["Network visualization explores relationships, such as friendships and cliques.

Arc diagrams are one-dimensional layouts of nodes with circular arcs linking each node. When used properly, with good order in nodes, cliques and bridges are easily identified in this layout.

The links are un-directed, and can be weighted or not depending on the goals of study. If the number of times two actors appeared in a movie is needed, links are assigned weights. The co-stardom network can also be represented by a bipartite graph where nodes are of two types: actors and movies. And edges connect different types of nodes (i.e. actors to movies) if they have a relationship (actors in a movie).\n\nAccording to (Newman, Strogatz, and Watts, 2001), the movie actor network can be described by a bipartite graph. Nodes in this graph are of two types: movies and actors. And the edges only connect nodes of different types. So edges link the co-stars to the movie they appear in.

The dots are called the vertices of the graph and represent the nodes of the network. \"Node\" and \"vertex\" are terms that can be used interchangeably when discussing graphs of networks. Figure 2.2 shows a graph representation of the circuit in figure 2.1.\nGraphs used in network analysis are usually, in addition, both directed graphs, to capture the direction of current flow and voltage, and labelled graphs, to capture the uniqueness of the branches and nodes. For instance, a graph consisting of a square of branches would still be the same topological graph if two branches were interchanged unless the branches were uniquely labelled. In directed graphs, the two nodes that a branch connects to are designated the source and target nodes. Typically, these will be indicated by an arrow drawn on the branch.\nSection::::Graph theory.:Incidence.\nIncidence is one of the basic properties of a graph. An edge that is connected to a vertex is said to be \"incident\" on that vertex. The incidence of a graph can be captured in matrix format with a matrix called an incidence matrix. In fact, the incidence matrix is an alternative mathematical representation of the graph which dispenses with the need for any kind of drawing. Matrix rows correspond to nodes and matrix columns correspond to branches. The elements of the matrix are either zero, for no incidence, or one, for incidence between the node and branch. Direction in directed graphs is indicated by the sign of the element."], "wikipedia-325726": ["Social network analysis (SNA) is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory. It characterizes networked structures in terms of \"nodes\" (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the \"ties\", \"edges\", or \"links\" (relationships or interactions) that connect them. Examples of social structures commonly visualized through social network analysis include social media networks, memes spread, information circulation, friendship and acquaintance networks, business networks, social networks, collaboration graphs, kinship, disease transmission, and sexual relationships. These networks are often visualized through \"sociograms\" in which nodes are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. These visualizations provide a means of qualitatively assessing networks by varying the visual representation of their nodes and edges to reflect attributes of interest.\n\nVisual representation of social networks is important to understand the network data and convey the result of the analysis. Numerous methods of visualization for data produced by social network analysis have been presented. Many of the analytic software have modules for network visualization. Exploration of the data is done through displaying nodes and ties in various layouts, and attributing colors, size and other advanced properties to nodes. Visual representations of networks may be a powerful method for conveying complex information, but care should be taken in interpreting node and graph properties from visual displays alone, as they may misrepresent structural properties better captured through quantitative analyses."], "wikipedia-325813": ["A drawing of a graph or network diagram is a pictorial representation of the vertices and edges of a graph. This drawing should not be confused with the graph itself: very different layouts can correspond to the same graph. In the abstract, all that matters is which pairs of vertices are connected by edges. In the concrete, however, the arrangement of these vertices and edges within a drawing affects its understandability, usability, fabrication cost, and aesthetics. The problem gets worse if the graph changes over time by adding and deleting edges (dynamic graph drawing) and the goal is to preserve the user's mental map.\n\nAlternative conventions to node\u2013link diagrams include adjacency representations such as circle packings, in which vertices are represented by disjoint regions in the plane and edges are represented by adjacencies between regions; intersection representations in which vertices are represented by non-disjoint geometric objects and edges are represented by their intersections; visibility representations in which vertices are represented by regions in the plane and edges are represented by regions that have an unobstructed line of sight to each other; confluent drawings, in which edges are represented as smooth curves within mathematical train tracks; fabrics, in which nodes are represented as horizontal lines and edges as vertical lines; and visualizations of the adjacency matrix of the graph."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

But in 2015, Bodlaender et al. [BCKN15] showed how to employ insights from the algebraic algorithms to weighted problems such as TSP while avoiding the aforementioned pseudo-polynomial overhead in the maximum input weight. They presented fast algorithms for TSP on instances in graphs of small treewidth that are very flexible in how sub-solutions are built similar to the tools from [CNP+11, CKN18]. The main observation from [BCKN15] was that, in any dynamic programming algorithm, the number of partial solutions could potentially be reduced significantly by using Gaussian elimination, if an appropriate \u2018partial solutions matrix\u2019 has sufficiently low rank. For (weighted) Hamiltonian cycle this turned out an especially useful approach since the associated partial solutions matrix is the aforementioned matchings connectivity matrix which has remarkably low rank [CKN18]."], "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/88": ["The natural idea to use of sparse or narrow matrix factorizations to solve the detecting of a pair satisfying a certain relation based on Freivalds has the same general blueprint of some algorithms in quite different settings [BHKK09, CKN18, FLPS16].

It is closely related to many other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from logic to statistical physics, from evolutionary biology to computer science, etc.\nTo fully understand the scope of combinatorics requires a great deal of further amplification, the details of which are not universally agreed upon. According to H.J. Ryser, a definition of the subject is difficult because it crosses so many mathematical subdivisions. Insofar as an area can be described by the types of problems it addresses, combinatorics is involved with\nBULLET::::- the \"enumeration\" (counting) of specified structures, sometimes referred to as arrangements or configurations in a very general sense, associated with finite systems,\nBULLET::::- the \"existence\" of such structures that satisfy certain given criteria,\nBULLET::::- the \"construction\" of these structures, perhaps in many ways, and\nBULLET::::- \"optimization\", finding the \"best\" structure or solution among several possibilities, be it the \"largest\", \"smallest\" or satisfying some other optimality criterion.\nLeon Mirsky has said: \"combinatorics is a range of linked studies which have something in common and yet diverge widely in their objectives, their methods, and the degree of coherence they have attained.\" One way to define combinatorics is, perhaps, to describe its subdivisions with their problems and techniques. This is the approach that is used below. However, there are also purely historical reasons for including or not including some topics under the combinatorics umbrella. Although primarily concerned with finite systems, some combinatorial questions and techniques can be extended to an infinite (specifically, countable) but discrete setting.\nCombinatorics is well known for the breadth of the problems it tackles. Combinatorial problems arise in many areas of pure mathematics, notably in algebra, probability theory, topology, and geometry, as well as in its many application areas. Many combinatorial questions have historically been considered in isolation, giving an \"ad hoc\" solution to a problem arising in some mathematical context. In the later twentieth century, however, powerful and general theoretical methods were developed, making combinatorics into an independent branch of mathematics in its own right. One of the oldest and most accessible parts of combinatorics is graph theory, which by itself has numerous natural connections to other areas. Combinatorics is used frequently in computer science to obtain formulas and estimates in the analysis of algorithms.\nA mathematician who studies combinatorics is called a \"\".\nSection::::History.\nBasic combinatorial concepts and enumerative results appeared throughout the ancient world. In the 6th century BCE, ancient Indian physician Sushruta asserts in Sushruta Samhita that 63 combinations can be made out of 6 different tastes, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc., thus computing all 2\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 possibilities. Greek historian Plutarch discusses an argument between Chrysippus (3rd century BCE) and Hipparchus (2nd century BCE) of a rather delicate enumerative problem, which was later shown to be related to Schr\u00f6der\u2013Hipparchus numbers. In the \"Ostomachion\", Archimedes (3rd century BCE) considers a tiling puzzle.\nIn the Middle Ages, combinatorics continued to be studied, largely outside of the European civilization. The Indian mathematician Mah\u0101v\u012bra (c. 850) provided formulae for the number of permutations and combinations, and these formulas may have been familiar to Indian mathematicians as early as the 6th century CE. The philosopher and astronomer Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra (c. 1140) established the symmetry of binomial coefficients, while a closed formula was obtained later by the talmudist and mathematician Levi ben Gerson (better known as Gersonides), in 1321.\nThe arithmetical triangle\u2014 a graphical diagram showing relationships among the binomial coefficients\u2014 was presented by mathematicians in treatises dating as far back as the 10th century, and would eventually become known as Pascal's triangle. Later, in Medieval England, campanology provided examples of what is now known as Hamiltonian cycles in certain Cayley graphs on permutations.\nDuring the Renaissance, together with the rest of mathematics and the sciences, combinatorics enjoyed a rebirth. Works of Pascal, Newton, Jacob Bernoulli and Euler became foundational in the emerging field. In modern times, the works of J.J. Sylvester (late 19th century) and Percy MacMahon (early 20th century) helped lay the foundation for enumerative and algebraic combinatorics. Graph theory also enjoyed an explosion of interest at the same time, especially in connection with the four color problem.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, combinatorics enjoyed a rapid growth, which led to establishment of dozens of new journals and conferences in the subject. In part, the growth was spurred by new connections and applications to other fields, ranging from algebra to probability, from functional analysis to number theory, etc. These connections shed the boundaries between combinatorics and parts of mathematics and theoretical computer science, but at the same time led to a partial fragmentation of the field.\nSection::::Approaches and subfields of combinatorics.\nSection::::Approaches and subfields of combinatorics.:Enumerative combinatorics.\nEnumerative combinatorics is the most classical area of combinatorics and concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects. Although counting the number of elements in a set is a rather broad mathematical problem, many of the problems that arise in applications have a relatively simple combinatorial description. Fibonacci numbers is the basic example of a problem in enumerative combinatorics. The twelvefold way provides a unified framework for counting permutations, combinations and partitions.\nSection::::Approaches and subfields of combinatorics.:Analytic combinatorics.\nAnalytic combinatorics concerns the enumeration of combinatorial structures using tools from complex analysis and probability theory. In contrast with enumerative combinatorics, which uses explicit combinatorial formulae and generating functions to describe the results, analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining asymptotic formulae.\nSection::::Approaches and subfields of combinatorics.:Partition theory.\nPartition theory studies various enumeration and asymptotic problems related to integer partitions, and is closely related to q-series, special functions and orthogonal polynomials. Originally a part of number theory and analysis, it is now considered a part of combinatorics or an independent field. It incorporates the bijective approach and various tools in analysis and analytic number theory, and has connections with statistical mechanics.\nSection::::Approaches and subfields of combinatorics.:Graph theory.\nGraphs are basic objects in combinatorics. The questions range from counting (e.g., the number of graphs on \"n\" vertices with \"k\" edges) to structural (e.g., which graphs contain Hamiltonian cycles) to algebraic questions (e.g., given a graph \"G\" and two numbers \"x\" and \"y\", does the Tutte polynomial \"T\"(\"x\",\"y\") have a combinatorial interpretation?). Although there are very strong connections between graph theory and combinatorics, these two are sometimes thought of as separate subjects. This is due to the fact that while combinatorial methods apply to many graph theory problems, the two are generally used to seek solutions to different problems.\nSection::::Approaches and subfields of combinatorics.:Design theory.\nDesign theory is a study of combinatorial designs, which are collections of subsets with certain intersection properties. Block designs are combinatorial designs of a special type. This area is one of the oldest parts of combinatorics, such as in Kirkman's schoolgirl problem proposed in 1850. The solution of the problem is a special case of a Steiner system, which systems play an important role in the classification of finite simple groups. The area has further connections to coding theory and geometric combinatorics.\nSection::::Approaches and subfields of combinatorics.:Finite geometry.\nFinite geometry is the study of geometric systems having only a finite number of points. Structures analogous to those found in continuous geometries (Euclidean plane, real projective space, etc.) but defined combinatorially are the main items studied. This area provides a rich source of examples for design theory. It should not be confused with discrete geometry (combinatorial geometry).\nSection::::Approaches and subfields of combinatorics.:Order theory.\nOrder theory is the study of partially ordered sets, both finite and infinite. Various examples of partial orders appear in algebra, geometry, number theory and throughout combinatorics and graph theory. Notable classes and examples of partial orders include lattices and Boolean algebras.\nSection::::Approaches and subfields of combinatorics.:Matroid theory.\nMatroid theory abstracts part of geometry. It studies the properties of sets (usually, finite sets) of vectors in a vector space that do not depend on the particular coefficients in a linear dependence relation. Not only the structure but also enumerative properties belong to matroid theory. Matroid theory was introduced by Hassler Whitney and studied as a part of order theory. It is now an independent field of study with a number of connections with other parts of combinatorics.\nSection::::Approaches and subfields of combinatorics.:Extremal combinatorics.\nExtremal combinatorics studies extremal questions on set"], "wikipedia-8492": ["Combinatorics studies the way in which discrete structures can be combined or arranged.\nEnumerative combinatorics concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects - e.g. the twelvefold way provides a unified framework for counting permutations, combinations and partitions.\nAnalytic combinatorics concerns the enumeration (i.e., determining the number) of combinatorial structures using tools from complex analysis and probability theory.

There are several sets of axioms which give rise to Euclidean geometry or to non-Euclidean geometries. These are fundamental to the study and of historical importance, but there are a great many modern geometries that are not Euclidean which can be studied from this viewpoint. The term axiomatic geometry can be applied to any geometry that is developed from an axiom system, but is often used to mean Euclidean geometry studied from this point of view. The completeness and independence of general axiomatic systems are important mathematical considerations, but there are also issues to do with the teaching of geometry which come into play.\n\nSection::::Axiomatic systems.\nBased on ancient Greek methods, an \"axiomatic system\" is a formal description of a way to establish the \"mathematical truth\" that flows from a fixed set of assumptions. Although applicable to any area of mathematics, geometry is the branch of elementary mathematics in which this method has most extensively been successfully applied.\nThere are several components of an axiomatic system.\nBULLET::::1. Primitives (undefined terms) are the most basic ideas. Typically they include objects and relationships. In geometry, the objects are things like \"points\", \"lines\" and \"planes\" while a fundamental relationship is that of \"incidence\" \u2013 of one object meeting or joining with another. The terms themselves are undefined. Hilbert once remarked that instead of points, lines and planes one might just as well talk of tables, chairs and beer mugs. His point being that the primitive terms are just empty shells, place holders if you will, and have no intrinsic properties.\nBULLET::::2. Axioms (or postulates) are statements about these primitives; for example, \"any two points are together incident with just one line\" (i.e. that for any two points, there is just one line which passes through both of them). Axioms are assumed true, and not proven. They are the \"building blocks\" of geometric concepts, since they specify the properties that the primitives have.\nBULLET::::3. The laws of logic.\nBULLET::::4. The theorems are the logical consequences of the axioms, that is, the statements that can be obtained from the axioms by using the laws of deductive logic.\nAn \"interpretation\" of an axiomatic system is some particular way of giving concrete meaning to the primitives of that system. If this association of meanings makes the axioms of the system true statements, then the interpretation is called a model of the system. In a model, all the theorems of the system are automatically true statements."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

Instead, they are simply definitions of notation.\nThe value of the derivative of \"y\" at a point may be expressed in two ways using Leibniz's notation:\nLeibniz's notation allows one to specify the variable for differentiation (in the denominator). This is especially helpful when considering partial derivatives. It also makes the chain rule easy to remember and recognize:\nLeibniz's notation for differentiation does require assigning a meaning to symbols such as \"dx\" or \"dy\" on their own, and some authors do not attempt to assign these symbols meaning. Leibniz treated these symbols as infinitesimals. Later authors have assigned them other meanings, such as infinitesimals in non-standard analysis or exterior derivatives.\nOne of the most common modern notations for differentiation is due to Joseph Louis Lagrange. In Lagrange's notation, a prime mark denotes a derivative. If \"f\" is a function, then its derivative evaluated at \"x\" is written\nHigher derivatives are indicated using additional prime marks, as in formula_9 for the second derivative and formula_10 for the third derivative. The use of repeated prime marks eventually becomes unwieldy. Some authors continue by employing Roman numerals, as in\nto denote fourth, fifth, sixth, and higher order derivatives.

However, this variable can also be notated explicitly. When \"f\" is a function of a variable \"x\", this is done by writing\nNewton's notation for differentiation (also called the dot notation for differentiation) places a dot over the dependent variable. That is, if \"y\" is a function of \"t\", then the derivative of \"y\" with respect to \"t\" is\nHigher derivatives are represented using multiple dots, as in\nNewton extended this idea quite far:\nWhen more specific types of differentiation are necessary, such as in multivariate calculus or tensor analysis, other notations are common.\nFor a function \"f\"(\"x\"), we can express the derivative using subscripts of the independent variable:\nThis type of notation is especially useful for taking partial derivatives of a function of several variables.\nPartial derivatives are generally distinguished from ordinary derivatives by replacing the differential operator \"d\" with a \"\u2202\" symbol. For example, we can indicate the partial derivative of with respect to \"x\", but not to \"y\" or \"z\" in several ways:\nHigher-order partial derivatives with respect to one variable are expressed as\nMixed partial derivatives can be expressed as\nIn this last case the variables are written in inverse order between the two notations, explained as follows:\nVector calculus concerns differentiation and integration of vector or scalar fields.

Otherwise, the notation ]\"a\", \"b\"[ may be used to denote the open interval whereas (\"a\", \"b\") is used for the ordered pair).\nIf \"A\" and \"B\" are sets, then the Cartesian product (or simply product) is defined to be:\nThat is, \"A\" \u00d7 \"B\" is the set of all ordered pairs whose first coordinate is an element of \"A\" and whose second coordinate is an element of \"B\".\nThis definition may be extended to a set \"A\" \u00d7 \"B\" \u00d7 \"C\" of ordered triples, and more generally to sets of ordered n-tuples for any positive integer \"n\".\nIt is even possible to define infinite Cartesian products, but this requires a more recondite definition of the product.\nCartesian products were first developed by Ren\u00e9 Descartes in the context of analytic geometry.

Some of these are listed below. In the list, \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" refer to natural numbers, and \"r\" and \"s\" are real numbers.\nBULLET::::1. Natural numbers are used for counting. A blackboard bold capital N (formula_7) often represents this set.\nBULLET::::2. Integers appear as solutions for \"x\" in equations like \"x\" + \"a\" = \"b\". A blackboard bold capital Z (formula_8) often represents this set (from the German \"Zahlen\", meaning \"numbers\").\nBULLET::::3. Rational numbers appear as solutions to equations like \"a\" + \"bx\" = \"c\". A blackboard bold capital Q (formula_9) often represents this set (for \"quotient\", because R is used for the set of real numbers).\nBULLET::::4. Algebraic numbers appear as solutions to polynomial equations (with integer coefficients) and may involve radicals (including formula_10) and certain other irrational numbers. A Q with an overline (formula_11) often represents this set. The overline denotes the operation of algebraic closure.\nBULLET::::5. Real numbers represent the \"real line\" and include all numbers that can be approximated by rationals. These numbers may be rational or algebraic but may also be transcendental numbers, which cannot appear as solutions to polynomial equations with rational coefficients. A blackboard bold capital R (formula_12) often represents this set.\nBULLET::::6. Complex numbers are sums of a real and an imaginary number: formula_13. Here either formula_14 or formula_15 (or both) can be zero; thus, the set of real numbers and the set of strictly imaginary numbers are subsets of the set of complex numbers, which form an algebraic closure for the set of real numbers, meaning that every polynomial with coefficients in formula_12 has at least one root in this set. A blackboard bold capital C (formula_17) often represents this set. Note that since a number formula_13 can be identified with a point formula_19 in the plane, formula_17 is basically \"the same\" as the Cartesian product formula_12\u00d7formula_12 (\"the same\" meaning that any point in one determines a unique point in the other and for the result of calculations, it doesn't matter which one is used for the calculation, as long as multiplication rule is appropriate for formula_17)."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

These in turn consist of configuration items."], "wikipedia-12988767": ["The meta-data side of the diagram consists of a concept diagram. This is basically an adjusted class diagram as described in Booch, Rumbaugh and Jacobson (1999). Important notions are concept, generalization, association, multiplicity and aggregation.\nSection::::Metadatamodeling Concepts.\nFirst of all, a concept is a simple version of a Unified Modeling Language (UML) class. The class definition is adopted to define a concept, namely: a set of objects that share the same attributes, operations, relations, and semantics.\nThe following concept types are specified:\nBULLET::::- STANDARD CONCEPT: a concept that contains no further (sub) concepts. A standard concept is visualized with a rectangle.\nBULLET::::- COMPLEX CONCEPT: a concept that consists of a collection of (sub) concepts. Complex concepts are divided into:\nBULLET::::- OPEN CONCEPT: a complex concept whose (sub) concepts are expanded. An open concept is visualized with two white rectangles above each other. (Correction: An open concept is visualized with 2 white rectangles, 1 overlaid over the other, offset to the right, with 3 corners of the rectangle beneath visible. )\nBULLET::::- CLOSED CONCEPT: a complex concept whose (sub) concepts are not expanded since it is not relevant in the specific context. A closed concept is visualized by a white rectangle above a black rectangle.\nIn Figure 1 the three concept types that are used in the modeling technique are illustrated. Concepts are always capitalized, not only in the diagram, but also when referring to them outside the diagram.\nIn Figure 2 all three concept types are exemplified. Part of the process-data diagram of the requirements workflow in the Unified Process is illustrated. The USE CASE MODEL is an open concept and consists of one or more ACTORS and one or more USE CASES. ACTOR is a standard concept, it contains no further sub-concepts. USE CASE, however, is a closed concept. A USE CASE consists of a description, a flow of events, conditions, special requirements, etc. Because in this case it is unnecessary to reveal that information, the USE CASE is illustrated with a closed concept.\nSection::::Metadatamodeling Concepts.:Generalization.\nGeneralization is a way to express a relationship between a general concept and a more specific concept. Also, if necessary, one can indicate whether the groups of concepts that are identified are overlapping or disjoint, complete or incomplete. Generalization is visualized by a solid arrow with an open arrowhead, pointing to the parent, as is illustrated in Figure 3.\nIn Figure 4 generalization is exemplified by showing the relationships between the different concepts described in the preceding paragraph. STANDARD CONCEPT and COMPLEX CONCEPT are both a specific kind of CONCEPT. Subsequently, a COMPLEX CONCEPT can be specified into an OPEN CONCEPT and a CLOSED CONCEPT.\nSection::::Metadatamodeling Concepts.:Association.\nAn association is a structural relationship that specifies how concepts are connected to another. It can connect two concepts (binary association) or more than two concepts (n-ary association). An association is represented with an undirected solid line. To give a meaning to the association, a name and name direction can be provided. The name is in the form of an active verb and the name direction is represented by a triangle that points in the direction one needs to read. Association with a name and name direction is illustrated in Figure 5.\nIn Figure 6 (removed) an example of association is illustrated. The example is a fragment of the process-data diagram of the requirements analysis in the Unified Process. Because both concepts are not expanded any further, although several sub concepts exist, the concepts are illustrated as closed concepts. The figure reads as \u201cSURVEY DESCRIPTION describes USE CASE MODEL\u201d.\nSection::::Metadatamodeling Concepts.:Multiplicity.\nExcept name and name direction, an association can have more characteristics. With multiplicity one can state how many objects of a certain concept can be connected across an instance of an association. Multiplicity is visualized by using the following expressions: (1) for exactly one, (0..1) for one or zero, (0..*) for zero or more, (1..*) for one or more, or for example (5) for an exact number. In Figure 7 association with multiplicity is illustrated.\nAn example of multiplicity is represented in Figure 8. It is the same example as in Figure 6, only the multiplicity values are added. The figure reads as \u2018exactly one SURVEY DESCRIPTION describes exactly one USE CASE MODEL\u2019. This implies that a SURVEY DESCRIPTION cannot describe zero or more than one USE CASE MODEL and a USE CASE MODEL cannot be described by zero or more than one SURVEY DESCRIPTIONS.\nSection::::Metadatamodeling Concepts.:Aggregation.\nA special type of association is aggregation. Aggregation represents the relation between a concept (as a whole) containing other concepts (as parts). It can also be described as a \u2018has-a\u2019 relationship. In Figure 9 an aggregation relationship between OPEN CONCEPT and STANDARD CONCEPT is illustrated. An OPEN CONCEPT consists of one or more STANDARD CONCEPTS and a STANDARD CONCEPT is part of zero or more OPEN CONCEPT.\nIn Figure 10 aggregation is exemplified by a fragment of the requirements capture workflow in UML-Based Web Engineering. A USE CASE MODEL consists of one or more ACTORS and USE CASES.\nSection::::Metadatamodeling Concepts.:Properties.\nSometimes the needs exist to assign properties to concepts. Properties are written in lower case, under the concept name, as is illustrated in Figure 11.\nIn Figure 12 an example of a concept with properties is visualized. The concept FEATURE has four properties, respectively: priority, type, risk and status."], "wikipedia-40117302": ["Other than the inclusion or exclusion of T, the relationships between the separation axioms are indicated in the diagram to the right. In this diagram, the non-T version of a condition is on the left side of the slash, and the T version is on the right side. Letters are used for abbreviation as follows:\n\"P\" = \"perfectly\", \"C\" = \"completely\", \"N\" = \"normal\", and \"R\" (without a subscript) = \"regular\". A bullet indicates that there is no special name for a space at that spot. The dash at the bottom indicates no condition.\nYou can combine two properties using this diagram by following the diagram upwards until both branches meet. For example, if a space is both completely normal (\"CN\") and completely Hausdorff (\"CT\"), then following both branches up, you find the spot \"\u2022/T\".\nSince completely Hausdorff spaces are T (even though completely normal spaces may not be), you take the T side of the slash, so a completely normal completely Hausdorff space is the same as a T space (less ambiguously known as a completely normal Hausdorff space, as you can see in the table above).\nAs you can see from the diagram, normal and R together imply a host of other properties, since combining the two properties leads you to follow a path through the many nodes on the rightside branch. Since regularity is the most well known of these, spaces that are both normal and R are typically called \"normal regular spaces\". In a somewhat similar fashion, spaces that are both normal and T are often called \"normal Hausdorff spaces\" by people that wish to avoid the ambiguous \"T\" notation. These conventions can be generalised to other regular spaces and Hausdorff spaces."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1. Yes  \n2.

It is usually understood as a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. This method can also be used to find the rank of a matrix, to calculate the determinant of a matrix, and to calculate the inverse of an invertible square matrix. The method is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777\u20131855), although it was known to Chinese mathematicians as early as 179\u00a0A.D. (see History section).\nTo perform row reduction on a matrix, one uses a sequence of elementary row operations to modify the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of the matrix is filled with zeros, as much as possible. There are three types of elementary row operations: \nBULLET::::- Swapping two rows,\nBULLET::::- Multiplying a row by a nonzero number,\nBULLET::::- Adding a multiple of one row to another row.\nUsing these operations, a matrix can always be transformed into an upper triangular matrix, and in fact one that is in row echelon form. Once all of the leading coefficients (the leftmost nonzero entry in each row) are 1, and every column containing a leading coefficient has zeros elsewhere, the matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form. This final form is unique; in other words, it is independent of the sequence of row operations used. For example, in the following sequence of row operations (where multiple elementary operations might be done at each step), the third and fourth matrices are the ones in row echelon form, and the final matrix is the unique reduced row echelon form.\nUsing row operations to convert a matrix into reduced row echelon form is sometimes called Gauss\u2013Jordan elimination. Some authors use the term Gaussian elimination to refer to the process until it has reached its upper triangular, or (unreduced) row echelon form. For computational reasons, when solving systems of linear equations, it is sometimes preferable to stop row operations before the matrix is completely reduced."]}, "arxiv": {"pre_retrieval_source_check": "1.

They used this to show that Hamiltonian cycles cannot be counted in (6 \u2212\ud835\udf00)pw\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc42(1)time for any \ud835\udf00 > 0 unless the SETH fails."]}}}, "document_relevance_score": {"wikipedia-3431840": 1, "wikipedia-48844125": 1, "wikipedia-58278312": 1, "wikipedia-44628821": 1, "wikipedia-305223": 1, "wikipedia-8517337": 1, "wikipedia-35683165": 1, "wikipedia-3480707": 1, "wikipedia-24562": 1, "wikipedia-1934318": 1, "arxiv-1108.3476": 1, "arxiv-1605.00507": 1, "arxiv-1203.1570": 1, "arxiv-1201.3599": 1, "arxiv-2210.02672": 1, "arxiv-1606.05889": 1, "arxiv-2210.14672": 1, "arxiv-2209.09573": 1, "arxiv-1108.1170": 1, "arxiv-1602.05950": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/78": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/34": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/49": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/88": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/44": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/13": 1}, "document_relevance_score_old": {"wikipedia-3431840": 1, "wikipedia-48844125": 1, "wikipedia-58278312": 1, "wikipedia-44628821": 1, "wikipedia-305223": 1, "wikipedia-8517337": 1, "wikipedia-35683165": 1, "wikipedia-3480707": 1, "wikipedia-24562": 1, "wikipedia-1934318": 1, "arxiv-1108.3476": 1, "arxiv-1605.00507": 1, "arxiv-1203.1570": 1, "arxiv-1201.3599": 1, "arxiv-2210.02672": 1, "arxiv-1606.05889": 1, "arxiv-2210.14672": 1, "arxiv-2209.09573": 1, "arxiv-1108.1170": 1, "arxiv-1602.05950": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/78": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/34": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/49": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/7": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/88": 2, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/4": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/1": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/8": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/44": 1, "paper/39/3357713.3384264.jsonl/13": 2}}}
